Jacob's Pickles,"It has been months since I have had Jacob's Pickles. As a Catholic, I gave up meat for Lent, so I looked forward to ordering my favorite chicken and biscuits for Easter Sunday.

Ordering from Jacob's pickles was a breeze. They had their regular items online, the delivery was on time and the food was packed well. The portions were still the same (large and filling) and quality was the same was when I dined here months ago.

I definitely will be ordering soon.

If you can, please support your local business and order from Jacobs! They also deliver their cocktails!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I don't think I even have the words. This place has the fried chicken my soul was looking for. Hot chicken biscuit is my favorite because it has a good kick, but isn't overly spicy. It doesn't come across very oily either (although it isn't the best traveler with the biscuit - I recommend they separate for takeout purposes). The portion is huge and the dish is RICH, so it's a very good idea to share, BUT you'll probably want more so just get your own :P

Also, the pickles are absolutely fantastic - very flavorful and crisp!

Can't wait to get more!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This place is very good; it's just a little heavy and greasy compared to my normal tastes.  I got the hot chicken biscuit with fries, deviled eggs, and classic Mac n cheese.  First of all, I thought the hot chicken biscuit would be as a sandwich, but it's actually a bowl with biscuit, hot chicken, and pickles.  Again, a little greasy, but the flavors were very good.  They compare this to Nashville hot chicken, and I'm from around Nashville--it's spicy and it's good, though not really ""hot.""  I'm normally not a pickle person, but their pickles compliment the dish nicely.  Jacob's is famous for their pickle combos, so I would try more of them!  The fries were average and oily.  The Mac n cheese, though I ordered a small, was a HUGE portion size.  Again, a little heavy, but if you want cheese, they DO NOT cheat you on the cheese.  It's very ooey and gooey, and best enjoyed while fresh and hot.  Don't let it get cold or it will turn into a cheese brick.  I had to get this during delivery for COVID 19, so I imagine it would be even better in house.  Also, the deviled eggs were ok, but could have used less filling and more seasoning.  This place has a ton of cocktails (which I haven't gotten to try), lots of comfort food (meatloaf, ribs), and their famous pickles.  They also have a biscuit brunch menu and beer.  I recommend, but do it on a day you can afford to pop some stomach meds and take a nap, not while you're on the move!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Customer service : super friendly. If they had a reward system, I would probably be winning with the amount of times I have came here. Reasons why I'm obsessed:
- They are very accommodating. I came here at a date one time and he gets cold easily, so they changed our outdoor seating to inside.
- They are good with surprises. I went up to my waiter to ask for ""extra forks"" but to order dessert for my friend whose birthday it was. Make you feel special by putting a sprinkler on the ice cream bread cake and sing Happy birthday.
- They know their menu: I come here and get the same thing, the mushroom gravy. I asked them what's a good side and they recommended the sour pickle. My friends now think of me when they think of pickles. It's Soo good.
- they have a great vibe, as in super down to earth southern hospitality, that I would never think I would experience (I'm born and raised in Texas)

Ambiance:
-I'm a millennial, and they play throwbacks all the time. I love their music selections. It varies on weekdays and weekend, but it always fits the scene.
-You get a mix crowd. Families, friends, young and old.
-The seating is tight, and sometimes you may not have privacy if you're coming here on a date and happen to be seated on the long tables. I like sitting next to my date, but you can't really do that here.
-morning and night scene is different. If you want you're makeup and hair to be seen, come in the morning or daylight, plenty of natural light. If you're having a bad hair day or it's raining, come at night. You may not see your food. Youll see a shadow of your date.
- friends or group: come during day light.

Food: I love everything on the menu and I stand by and say that as a southern girl, this is my favorite restaurant in NY and no one will change this. The photos are basically self explanatory.
- favorite dessert: biscuit bread with vanilla ice cream, although the fried Oreos is also a good choice if you want something small and sweet.
- favorite item: mushroom gravy smothered chicken. It's savory and it's Soo good as leftovers. Take my word for it !

Overall: Best time to come here are off hours. So weekend brunch, there will be a wait, with all parties present. If coming for dinner, the lighting is fairly low to dark so FYI. 2-5 pm are prime time to come for no wait time. I have came here for weekend brunches, weekday brunch, lunch, and dinner, and I can say that unless you get lucky, be prepared to wait for at least an hour. But it's so worth it. I love the staff because they give good suggestion, so chill and friendly, and charming. The quantity is large so share and try multiple things. You won't be disappointed.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Ordered brunch delivery during COVID pandemic and totally worth it! As previous reviews have mentioned, the portion sizes are huge. Ordered a biscuit sandwich, patty melt for my girlfriend, and the poutine to share. Waaaaay too much for the two of us, it was enough for two meals for the both of us. Not a bad problem to have especially while I'm ordering delivery for every meal these past few months.

The biscuit sandwich was great. Super heavy like all southern food, and the fried chicken was fried well, not dry at all. I got the smothered pepper jack chicken which was very very tasty. The biscuit sandwich was delicious and a 5 star dish. The patty melt was decent, my only issue was it was too salty. The best part of the patty melt was the side of fries, so had to give it only 3 stars. The poutine was decent. No cheese curds which I was not used to, but still good. Only wish there was more gravy.

I really did love their spicy pickled green beans. By far the best pickled anything I've ever had. So sour I was scrunching my face on every other green bean.

Highlights: Definitely the biscuit sandwiches and the pickles!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Ambiance, ambiance! Dimly lit, long farm table style tabled restaurant with loud music.
We've dined here twice and both times have thoroughly enjoyed our time. We've tried the honey chicken sandwich, hot chicken sandwich and mac and cheese. If you're a party of 2, I recommend ordering one sandwich and an app to share. Portions are huge! Recommend the honey chicken sandwich - incredibly juicy and flavorful. The breading is perfect and not too thick. Mac n cheese is also great, but definitely for cheese lovers.
Amazing food and hip ambiance, winner on the UWS!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Overall: Good portion for the price

Ambience: Due to covid this was a takeout order, but the place looked chill with their beer specials.

Food: I have read a lot of reviews and have been wanting to try it out. I ordered the Mac 'n' Cheese and Southern Style Chicken with Cheese Grits. As everyone says, the portions are good sized. The taste is pretty good, but I wasn't absolutely floored that I have tasted something extraordinare. It was good but not mouth watering phenomenal. I blame the covid experience for it, but hope to give this place a second try.

Price: Two meals (as pictured) via take out was $35. Yes the portions are big, but I wouldn't $35 for this again. I would get something else.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Excellent restaurant in a cool place... Great service.
The atmosphere was pleasant and inviting.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"NOT A FAN! Don't believe the hype!
The chicken had to much honey it overpowers the chicken and the biscuit, The shrimp and Grits are not good the grits are very runny the shrimps bland with the head and the legs on also bland and too much bacon. The drink was great I recommend it.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Couldn't resist trying one of their massive cheesy menu options. Ordered the poutine to-go since they were fully booked for dining in. Presentation wise, it didn't look amazing in a container, but it was really delicious. They don't use cheese curds like how a poutine is supposed to be; it's a stringy cheese instead, and there's a white sauce/gravy as well. Even though it was a huge portion, for $16, it's really pricey given that it's just fries topped with grated cheese and sauce. I imagine a big factor is the experience, since the place has a great vibe, and the servers are all so friendly.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Not sure why out of all my years living on the UWS I never came into Jacobs pickles ! But better late than never. I'm not sure where to even begin my mouth is watering just thinking about the delicious food.

I recently went for Sunday breakfast literally was there at 9am with family, jacobs was my dads choice. I was so confused as to why we were there so early but as soon as we were seated people kept coming in and next thing you know it was a full house. So before coming be prepared to wait if it's busy hours which is usually all day for them.

The food was amazing ! This has to be the best fried  chicken I've ever had. Best part is the wait was not long at all for the food and the staff was very friendly and attentive.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Jacob's Pickles is so hyped up you'd think it would never be able to live up to its high standards. Plot twist: it's even better than expected. A few friends and I stopped in after a 5k, totally starving from the run. We got fried pickles, biscuits and an entree each. Let me tell you- there's no possible way we could have finished this mountain of savory food. Each dish was better than the last- HIGHLY recommend the chicken and pancakes! But you will leave feeling bloated 1000%. I took my left overs home and ate my chicken and pancakes for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner!  

Our server, Caroline, was great and super knowledgeable about the menu. Our glasses were never empty and the restaurant was clean.

Jacob's Pickles is known for having long lines (they don't take reservations for parties less than 6 people). However, we showed up at 9am on a Sunday, right when they opened, and were seated immediately. By the time we left around 10:15, the restaurant was starting to get busy.

If you have the opportunity, don't miss out on trying this UWS institution!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"So first off, I didnt realize that this place does massive portions. So keep that in mind.

Now, onto the poutine.
YO. Damn. There's not a lot I wouldn't do for those poutine fries. I would *die* for them.
So freakin delicious.

I got the hot chicken biscuit sandwich which was pretty tasty, but my friend got the creamy bbq (I think was the name) biscuit sandwich and it was FIRE. I'd definitely get that over the hot chicken next time. The mac and cheese was incredible too.

The wait is long (got there about 3pm on a saturday and had over an hour wait). So just go to one of the bars next door and get drunk so you can be ready to demolish huge mounds of good food.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This place is a good time with good vibes. It seemed consistently busy throughout the night and when we showed up I was expecting at least a 20 min wait but it was only 10 minutes.

You can order full menu at the bar so we sat there. Our server was Jess and she was one of the best servers we've ever had. Cool chick who was ready to let us know everything about the place and the menu items. We ended up getting 4 different kinds of pickles which were the dill green beans, sour green tomatoes, big dill kosher cukes, and the jalapenos. I have to say I was looking forward to these the most but they weren't the best parts of the meal. The dilly green beans seemed overpowered by vinegar, the jalapenos were overly soft and little pepper flavor, and the kosher cukes were good but pretty much the same as the store brand. The sour tomatoes were the most decent out of all of them, pretty well balanced.

Our entrees were the thigh basket and the nashville  hot chicken biscuit  sandwich. The thighs were giant and had a good crust.  I didn't think the nashville chicken wass that hot but it also delivered in portion and good breading. I'd say hands down the best part were the biscuits! I didn't care for the sauce on top but the biscuit itself was a big cloud of heaven. After seeing and eating that I can understand why it's on their take out menu. I probably could've downed  5 of those if I didn't have the other food!

We'll be back again and next time I plan to have another biscuit and desserts because our waitreess recommended them!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"After my sister raved about Jacob's Pickles I knew we had to have brunch here! The restaurant was a decently long subway ride from our hotel in Chelsea, but we visited Central Park afterwards to walk off the 2,000+ calories we had just consumed.

You can't go wrong with the chicken and biscuits, but which Southern biscuit sandwich do you choose? I selected the sausage gravy smothered chicken biscuit and my husband went with the hot chicken. Both of these massive platters are served with cheese grits which are delicious, but a bit overkill with this already rich breakfast. I loved my meal, but I barely made it halfway through my plate. I think I would order the honey chicken and pickles next time in attempts to consume a slightly less gut-busting meal.

While I loved the food at Jacob's Pickles, I really would have preferred to pay a little less and receive a smaller plate. I hate wasting food, but we didn't have a fridge in our hotel and there was no way I was going to finish my meal.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"A bit out of the way from a lot of things in the city but the trip up is totally worth it. Came in around 2:30pm for a late lunch and still had to wait about 30 min! That's how popular this place is.

I got the five boroughs beer, and it was solid. We also got the 4 types of pickles option as the appetizer, and wow they were all super unique in their own ways. My favorite was the basic dill though. For my entree, I ordered the chicken and pancakes, and it was the most massive thing ever. I swear it's enough for 3 people. I tried it with the hot sauce at the table as well as the honey, and both options were amazing. I only ate about half and had to pack the rest to go. Also had to take the rest of our pickles to go! I was so stuffed after but so fulfilled. Will definitely come again if in the area!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This place absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best meals I've had in New York City.

Just spectacular, flavorful, moist, great texture open face fried chicken sandwiches fit to feed an entire village per order.

Don't be deceived by the restaurant's name- there is so many options that have nothing to do with pickles.

I ordered the bacon egg and cheese and it was fantastic. The chicken was perfect. The bacon was thick cut and in conjunction with the chicken provided a smoky flavor that was amazing. It was smothered with a runny egg and a handfuls of shredded cheese. It was one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had.

The service was amazing and extremely attentive, and that's saying a lot because the restaurant is huge. The place is a great vibe, everyone is happy and having a good time. There is a reason there is always a wait for this place.

Go here. I would go back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Let me navigate you through a chilly fall Saturday night in November that had me almost ready to move to the UWS to get unlimited access to the restaurant. We got there around 6:30 last Saturday and were told that there was an hour wait. (Just a heads up, reservations are only allowed for a party of 6 or more). Otherwise get there early, pregame at the bar next door and wait patiently .. VERY patiently.....trust me, it's worth it.) Fast forward to one hour and 15 mins later...finally were called into the bustling restaurant and promptly seated, completely unaware of the journey that we were about to embark.

I was entranced by the dim lighting and rustic ambiance...the 20th century light fixtures juxtaposing the candle lit mason jars. I ordered sausage gravy fried chicken and the flying mule (cocktail). Take a moment and imagine submerging your royal goblet into a fountain of warm liquid gold. That's what it was. Probably one of the best mules I've had. The sausage gravy fried chicken was so decadent, it pulled me into a bubble of pure bliss. The chicken was crisp, tender and succulent. The biscuits warm and pillowy. The table was just silent and during this moment, we began to understand what we had gotten ourselves into. 

A couple of cons
1. Because it's not a huge space when you get seated expect to be distracted by the amount of people standing by the bar waiting for a table. 
2. It's loud.
3. The service was lacking a bit but that can be attributed to how busy it was that night. 

Ultimately, you need to go. You will not be disappointed.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Had a very pleasant experience here. Found bar seating for 1 pretty quickly though the place was hopping! I enjoyed the throwback hip hop songs going like Tupac, Coolio, OutKast.

My bartender provided me some of the quickest, friendliest service of all time. Free strawberry jam shot provided! I ordered the chicken and pickles biscuit sandwich which was YUGE in size and quite tasty. Those cheesy greets were something else, very sharp flavor (mildly sour tasting). The chicken was perfectly crispy but a tad bland in the coating--would've liked more spices. Biscuit was soft and tasty. This needs to be eaten with a fork and knife. Ya gotta love pickles for this place. They season them with a kick. Overall minus a star because the food was pretty good, but not blow away life changing.

Cocktails were great especially the porch sipper--wild turkey bourbon with a really fresh flavor of oranges and citrus. On the sweet side (which I usually don't enjoy), but very refreshing and not overbearing. Comes in a large mason jar. I also ordered a pickleback shot but was definitely not served Jameson--it tasted bottom shelf, hard to get down. Came in cute major jars though instead of a shot glass, and very generous pours + a spicy pickle spear. Can't really be too unhappy with all that.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"First, the food is very very good. We started with  the dilly pickles. Very tasty!! Next, I had the veggie omelette. I asked for cheese grits instead of home fries. They brought home fries by mistake so I got to try those. The omelette was sooo good. Cooked perfectly and the cheese was so yummy. The cheese grits tasted like instant so I didn't care for them. The fries were quite good. My son had the biscuits and sausage gravy. People this is the thing to get. The biscuit was light and fluffy and the gravy so good. It was very filling as well.

When we put our name in we were told it was a 15-25 minute wait. 35 minutes later the couple who arrived AFTER us was seated first. I went to ask and they said we were next. They got a two top and we were seated family style. As a lefty this is always problematic. I felt like I couldn't have a conversation with my son because it was so loud. Also, if you have kids, the rap music is not the PG version. So beware.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Welcome to the southern comfort food gem of nyc. This has to be one of the best brunch spots. Food is delicious and portions are HUGE. There's outdoor seating which is nice for the warmer days. The main dining room is bustling and lively with 90s music playing. I came to try the pickles because it's called Jacob's pickles after all but their southern biscuit sandwiches were the real deal.

We ordered a beer flight and a pickle sampler along with two entrees but that was definitely way too much for two people since you can easily share an entree. We could've done without the pickle sampler because it was pickle overload, however, it was interesting to try the different flavors. The mac and cheese was rich and cheesy. We also got the honey chicken and pickles with the Nashville hot sauce on the side. The two pieces of fried chicken had the perfect ratio of chicken to batter which was crispy and juicy. I normally don't love biscuits but they were a little crunchy yet still so soft and buttery. The Nashville hot sauce put my entire meal together, not very spicy but so SO flavorful that I even added some to the mac and cheese.

Tip: If you can't make it all the way to the uws, Jacob's pickles is now in the Time Out Market by Brooklyn bridge park and the southern biscuit sandwiches are just as indulgent. They have a limited menu there but it's good enough for me whenever I'm craving it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"How have I not reviewed this place yet??!!! This is the most amazing place to eat in NYC. Period!!!! I'm done.

Alright, maybe it's not the best place flat out, but it's really, REALLY GOOD. Like we've sat outside in sub-30 degree weather to eat here and have not regretted it. That's how good the food is.

We've tried several things and everything has been fantastic and delicious. The 2 things I recommend you order: 1) the Croque Madame and 2) the Poutine.

These are probably the 2 best dishes I've had and they're amazing. Like so much so that we've literally take the leftovers on a plane and had them a few hours later after arriving home. It's that good!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"JP deserves its five stars the old fashioned way: you don't get this exact delicious food anywhere else.

They say it is Southern food? Nah...lighter fry, my gosh I felt chicken was healthy and moist with a little crispy edge.

Cheese and grits? Okay, as heavy and  Southern as ever. Too delicious --loved.

Want light? Catfish tacos.

My hubby did that. I did biscuit fried chicken BLT with fried chicken and fried green tomato....gggrrreeeeaaattt. Lots of slaw.

We got there prepared to wait. Took our cell phone number while we walked neighborhood. They buzzed us in time. Cool!

Try pickled jalapeños if you like heat. Pickle slices were served with the honey fried chicken biscuit and hot Nashville chicken and biscuit ordered by our friends. Plenty for all to try a pickle piece. So we had a pickled pickle and a peck of pickled jalapeños peppers.

Cool bar decor with many bottles of each liquor such as Titos in a row.

Jacob's Pickles deserves its hype.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Very cool place with outstanding food.  The service out impeccable and the menu options were unique. I will say the chair, and bar stools are not the most comfortable, but I decided to eat and drink more, which made me forget about that. We decided to order several different items to share in hopes of ordering an entrée to split.  However, the items were so large that we couldn't even finish what we had ordered.  The deviled eggs, pickles, and poutine were delicious but I don't really understand the insanely large portion. We would have continued to order items, but the portions are way too much, and I could tell by looking around no one ate everything on their plates, which is such a waste.  
I would definitely recommend checking this place out even with the large portions, but just keep that in mind when ordering.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"The food is amazing. Southern-style, not subtle in flavors or portions! The service is brisk, bordering on rushed. Especially once you've gotten your check and they are waiting for you to pay. Good amount of space between the outdoor tables in the COVID era.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I came on a Tuesday after work for dinner with 3 friends. This was a great choice. We started at the bar until everyone arrived.

We had an appetizer of the deviled eggs. Very good. We had predinner cocktails.  The Spicy Brine Margarita was DELICIOUS!! Loved it. The perfect blend.

For dinner I had the fried chicken thigh basket with the collard greens and grits. I enjoyed everything except the grits.  They were cooked perfect but the cheddar cheese they used is not tasty at all. The collard greens were the BOMB!! I should have gotten a double of those greens.

My other guests got catfish tacos, the jacob patty melt and the bbq chicken smothered pepper jack entrees. They also all enjoyed.

The service was also good. Attentive and friendly.  But I want to highlight my favorite part of the night which was the music.  It was awesome. Created the perfect vibe and ambiance. We were there 4 hours and didn't even realize it.

I would definitely come back. I highly recommend anyone to stop by and give Jacob's Pickles a try.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Come here really really hungry and with a couple of people if you can! Portions are huge! Recommended by a friend and I'm so glad we checked it out.

Three of us on Monday for a late afternoon brunch. We were seated right away. Pretty busy for a Monday so that's always good to see. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Knowledgeable of the menu as well. My friends ordered some alcoholic beverages and they really enjoyed.

We knew coming in the portions were big so we shared the poutine, side of pickled greens beans and smothered fried chicken. Everything was bomb and probably about 2,000 calories each lol. I liked that they layered the cheese and gravy throughout the fries and not just on top. Surprisingly, the fries didn't get too soggy. The poutine was SO good. We probably needed two or three more people to finish it though.
Gravy and fried chicken was tasty as well. Homemade biscuit with fried chicken and gravy, yum! Chicken had a ton of flavor even without the gravy on top and it stayed crunchy. Also comes with a side of cheese grits.
I also ordered a side of two over easy eggs which paired so well with the chicken and gravy. The yolky goodness on top of the chicken, still drooling over it.

This place has such good vibes and loved the homemade pickled vegetables and biscuits. I will be back next time I'm in NY!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,Damn! Good! I was so impressed I was trying to figure out a way I could go once a week lol. Just too far for me,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This place is delicious and quite the experience on a random block ""behind"" the American Museum of Natural History.  Having no kind of family recommendations and only yelp to guide me, this place was a quality find on my star based list.

The southern menu and mention of biscuits was the main draw.  A warning to newbies, look at the orders around you, the portions are insane!  Half the biscuit is as big as the whole skillet that came with my meal.  The amount of bread and cheese compared to my actual eggs and potato hash was gratuitous.  The fried chicken was well made though not very thick.

The service was great, the ambiance perfect, and everything arrived quickly and fresh and delicious.  

I would go back for sure, just keep my eye out for more veggie heavy options.

The best part of this place was my lunch date memory with my son.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I dropped by on a Friday night when a friend was visiting me from LA. The wait was twenty minutes so no issues there. The place was packed and the vibe is good. The only con there is that the music is insanely loud - impossible to hear what the person next to you is saying.

We ordered a biscuit, the poutine, classic Mac and cheese, and green tomatoes. My friend has some fried chicken on the side.

The biscuit was underwhelming- I think the biscuits I can make at home are better. My friend said that the fried chicken tasted like nothing out of the ordinary and she would pass. I did like the green tomatoes and Mac and cheese and would recommend. The real winner is the poutine though - it's a hugeeeeeee portion and was delicious!

Overall, good vibe and southern food but come in a big group and one dish is good to share between two people.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"We went early Sunday morning right when they opened. There were already a bunch of patrons ready to be seated and fed.
This was a big indicator to me that the food would be great and also that as the day progressed there would be a bit of wait to get seated.
Since we were there so early we got seated right away.
The food was exactly as I expected it to be. Delicious and soulful!
We ordered the chicken and pancakes (a different spin on chicken and waffles) which was so yummy and fulfilling.
We also got the croque madame, which is enough to share among 2 people! It was perfect and cheesy!

The customer service was just right.

I will certainly be going back for brunch and dinner.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I almost don't want to post this review because I like to keep the really good eats all to myself, but clearly the cat is out of the bag on this place. The wait is always long and seems especially long while watching people eat while standing in the cold, but it is well worth it. I can't remember having one thing here that I have been disappointed with. Servers are always warm, helpful, and courteous. Food comes out really quickly and the portions are big enough for two people to share. I mean, I do have to stop myself from eating it all by myself so it just depends on how hungry you are that day. Great for brunch and dinner. Diverse beer selection for the type of place it is and it has something for everyone.

Warning though, calorie conscious folks might have a problem or two sticking to your plan here. Don't tempt yourself.... or do, like I did.

Will be back. Good place to bring family and friends visiting NYC.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Went to brunch on a Sunday at 3, we sat at the corner of the bar since it's pretty roomy.
We got the fried pickles to start and some aviation gin and tonics. The fried pickles weres perfect, I just wish they gave more of them! The bartender was nice and funny since we were talking about the aviation gin (by Ryan Reynolds).
We got the Mac and cheese to share and it was really creamy.
I got the mushroom biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs (forgot to take a pic). I was excited to try a vegetarian gravy since no places really have that! It was pretty good but I've had better biscuits.
My boyfriend got the fried chicken with sausage and he said the chicken was crispy and the gravy was good too. He also thought the biscuits weren't the best he's had.

I definitely want to come back and try some other stuff. Love the vibe of the place too!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Well I can certainly understand the hype around this UWS gem now that I've been! My two friends and I came on a Saturday morning and luckily there was not a wait.

This is a really ideal place for an indulgent brunch without all the frills and stuck up atmosphere that you'd find at other places but with HUGE portions for a decent price.

My friends and I ordered three dishes (croque madam, bacon egg chicken biscuit, and southern chicken biscuit) as well as an ice coffee and the total came out to be around $75 in total with tax and tip. However the portions were HUGE.

You should definitely come with a group of friends and go family style or be prepared to go home with a lot of leftovers (I only managed to eat a 1/3 of my croque madam) but my guy friends managed to finish 3/4 to all of their plates!

I think for value, I really liked the croque madam because I got to enjoy their infamous fried chicken and biscuit but also have my egg and ham. Plus I much preferred potatoes to grits. The fried tomatoes were so so on my friend's southern chicken biscuit but the table next to us got this lovely pumpkin biscuit special which I'd love to try next time.

It does get a bit loud in the back as the quarters are tight but it wasn't unbearable.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Likes: even though coming in with high expectations, the tastes and quality of the food were still too good to be true. I am usually not someone who particularly seeks out for southern food, but everything here is deliiiiiish, from the savoriness and crispiness of the chicken wings, the perfect moist and rich taste of the corn bread, to the millions of dipping sauces that are offered on the table. I see why people would wait for hours just to have a bit of it.

Hopes for improvement: wish they have a better way to organize the wait list. The gentleman at the check in mistakenly marked our party as incomplete, which resulted in us waiting for at least 30 minutes more than we should have, only to notice afterwards that many who have come after us were seated before us. The gentleman only never gave us any updates and we had to go in line to talk to him multiple times to make things clear.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I've been wanting to try Jacob's pickles since I moved to the city three years ago and this week I finally got around to it. I'd say it lives up to the hype!

I was lucky enough to go on a weekday for lunch, when there is absolutely no wait. I got the southern BLT biscuit and fried chicken entree. The chicken was extra crispy, sauce was delicious, and it was slathered with really good cole slaw! The cheesy grits that paired with it were really good as well. The biscuits weren't too dry and absorbed the sauce, Cole slaw, and chicken really well.

Great meal as a cheat day and to indulge. Positions are huge so you'll probably have leftovers or could share with another person!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I love Jacob's. The food is amazing and the atmosphere was great , they played old R&B tunes which had me jamming and eating in my seat. The Mac and cheese is tasty and the chicken and pancakes was good. I will be back real soon !

Jacob's Pickles,"Would've given 4 stars if it wasn't for the long wait (over an hour at 2pm on Saturday) + super loud neighboring diners. Felt like we were all squished together and everyone had to yell to hear the other people in their party.

As for the food, the fried chicken (honey fried chicken biscuit) was super crispy and delightful for the first few bites. And then I guess the honey sank in and the rest of the chicken became soggy. Flavor was very yummy at least!

If I come back again, it'll be with a reservation and will definitely ask for honey/dressings on the side.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Definitely one of the best place for dinner and drinks. I love the ambiance and music. The vibe was really nice for dates. The dim lights and music were perfect to have intimate conversations while having privacy from tables close by.

The appetizer we got was the fried pickles, which were light and crispy. The only down side was that they didn't have enough for me to gobble up but....

The entrees were HUGE. We got the sausage gravy chicken biscuit, honey chicken and shrimp grits! They were all delicious and filling. I loved the southern portions!

Overall it was a great dinner.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,My favorite southern restaurant in NYC. Huge portions and great food. Can be loud at times but love the atmosphere.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"UPDATE 05/15/2020: Special delivery-pickup update! Still 5 stars; we had the Patty Melt and the Southern BLT (we clearly have favorites), and 4 pickles: sour green tomatoes, dilly beans, beets, and hot sours. Total delivered, around $50. Packing and delivery got the food to us 10 blocks south in great shape. The Patty Melt was perfectly cooked, which is impressive for a delivery item. And I hafta add that the Spicy Brine Margarita is my favorite spicy cocktail - and there are worthy competitors.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"WOW WOW WOW! This restaurant is INSANE! Fried chicken with sausage gravy 5 STARS ALL DAY LONG!

Super crowded all day and night during the weekends. Don't be afraid - it's totally worth the wait.

Hamburger Mac and Cheese - next level. Totally enough for two. Totally enough for a post hangover gut bomb for two.

Ribs fall off the bone. Perfectly slow cooked / smoked with insane bbq sauce. Sever with a baked potato smothered in buttery cheesy bacony goodness. The slaw is next level. Maybe best slaw I've ever had.

Skip the brussel sprouts.

The bartenders rock. The place is always packed but they make eye contact with everyone and get you your drink quick.

Get the fried chicken and sausage gravy. It will change your life. My wife my kids and I will get three orders for lunch / dinner and fight over every bite. Incredible.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"The dilly beans are a MUST TRY for any pickle lover! The vinegar and mustard flavors are super strong, and the best part about pickles is that they're just as good when you take them home. The biscuit sandwiches were also amazing and enormous. I highly recommend the sausage gravy; the chicken was perfectly fried, the gravy was savory, and both the biscuit and the creamy grits were super buttery. It was definitely extremely filling, so come hungry! The cocktails are pricey (~$12-14), but strong, so one is enough. The beer list is pretty extensive as well. I highly recommend this place, but beware that it's an extremely popular weekend brunch spot and they only take reservations for parties of 6+. I came for brunch on a weekday and had absolutely no problems finding a table.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This UWS southern gem has been on my foodie list for some time and happy to have unexpectedly walk into it today for an early dinner. The place was surly busy on this fall Saturday, but we were seated immediately. Our waiter was very pleasant and knowledgeable on the menu as we expressed it was our first time.
She shared the specials for the day and gave us a heads up that the servings for entrees were large portions (more like huge) which def makes it great for your money.

We had the fried pickles and 2 buttermilk biscuits with the ""works"" as starters.
Entree were the Chicken and Pancakes and the Jacobs Patty melt. OH MY! The patty melt came on a lunch sized tray loaded with fries cooked to my request. The pancakes were huge and fluffy and 2 beautiful sized pieces of chicken. We enjoyed the presentation and then the flavor and then were intimated by the size that we couldn't finish haha.
Def would want to come back to try their brunch and more beer options.
I'm no pickle lover, but if you love that def give Jacobs a spin for your fix too.
Overall, good customer service, quick turnaround with food, good ambiance and clean space. Accessible by public transportation.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Rich, delicious food in generous portions. I've never been disappointed in anything I've ordered here. Today I had the catfish tacos and thought that the sauces were delicious. The catfish itself was nice and smokey with a charred outside. The one complaint I might add is that the sogginess of the sauce led to the tortillas kind of falling apart when I was eating the taco. But, all the ingredients were fresh and delicious and went really well together.

The cheesy grits are a little too cheesy and buttery for me. I enjoy grits just as they are. that said I can see why they are very popular for people who love that cheesy buttery texture. The fried chicken and pancakes and waffles here are all not just delicious but also given in large portions.

The pickles of course are high quality and yummy. You get something pickled usually with each entree. For the weekends and brunch it is extremely crowded. Anytime you can make a reservation try to do so ahead of time.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Came here on a saturday late afternoon around 1:30pm and it was still a 90 minute wait for a table of 2. When we got the text, we had literally 5 minutes to get back to the restaurant or we'd lose our spot. No confirmation to secure our table, which is kind of ridiculous. I guess that's how businesses are now a days when they are so popular. We didn't make it in time, but luckily the person behind us also didn't show up so we were able to get a table. They had given us a table outside, and would be with us in a second. They didn't even give us a menu. When the waiter finally came around, he wondered if we just sat down from off the street since we didn't have a menu - such a strange place.

When we finally got the menu, we ordered 2 appetizers -- street corn and fried pickles. I also got the mushroom gravy smothered chicken sandwich.I would say the appetizers aren't worth it. It was good to try, but it isn't a good value for how much you get. The chicken is what was really good. I think that is the most satisfying part of the meal. It is a lot of food. I ended up taking it to go -- though it was a long process. Overall, the service is really slow. I think I would come more often if it wasn't a whole day thing.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"My boyfriend and I always have Jacob's Pickles at Timeout Market, but since it's closed due to the virus we decided to troop it all the way to the restaurant itself!

Jacob's Pickles,"An excellent way to start a beautiful Sunday.
1. Space is energetic but casual like an indoor bbq joint
2. The food is insanely tasty and portions are humongous- must go only if hungry
3. Loved for 2- couldn't finish Mac though so brought it home

Mac and cheese small portion
Fried chicken biscuit with honey and hot sauce on the side
Croque madame

4. In true we don't calories here style they don't serve skim or almond milk though with coffee

5. Service is upbeat and kind",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This restaurant needs to learn how to deal with large crowds, Chick-fil-A style. They texted us our table was ready at 2:39 and we actually got sat at 2:55. Finally starving we ordered and the food was amazing so the wait was totally worth it even though I would most likely do take out next time to avoid being the LAST ones seated. This is the type of place you avoid until about 3:30 PM. Hot chicken biscuit was 10/10 amazing and the hot pickles were so so delicious. The Mac n cheese also delicious and creamy and cheesy. The beef sandwhich was eh but she should have known that would not be the stand out item out of everything else this place has to offer. Would be back but would hope the hostess that worked Sunday brunch is not there.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"My friends and I came for lunch on Friday, and I think we came at a perfect time at around 1 because we got to sit down right away. Although we sat down at the large communal table, the spots next to us eventually cleared up. The waiter was really nice in explaining what specials they had, the popular items they have on the menu, and warming us that the portion sizes are pretty big. I'm glad he did because the 3 dishes that we had got were enough for the 4 of us to feel stuffed but happy when we left the restaurant.

We ordered the French toast, Croque Madame, and the Sausage Gravy Chicken Biscuit. Each of these dishes had a unique flavor profile to itself, despite having a biscuit in every dish.

I've never had a French Toast biscuit before but this was a game changer. The dish already had 4 different pieces of French toast. The outside was nice and crunch with a light sugar powdering, topped with a nice serving of strawberries. Their syrup they have on the table also wasn't too sweet so I didn't feel like it over powered the other flavors.

The Croque Madame was huge! The stacked fried egg over the ham, friend buttermilk chicken, over a biscuit with amazing sauce was super delicious. It was a little bit salty, but the flavors really matched. The biscuit they utilized in this dish also had bacon bits cooked within it. This dish also comes with circular cut potatoes, some are thin so it's crunch like a chip but some of the other ones still had the fluffy potato texture.

The last dish, the sausage gravy chicken biscuit, is definitely a super comfort food. The gravy itself was rich in flavor and paired well with the spices in the buttermilk chicken. I'm typically not a fan of grits but the way they mixed the cheese into the grits made it really delicious.

I would definitely come back here to try their pickles and beer. They have a really amazing selection on the menu that I'm dying to try.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Paint me green and call me a pickle. This place is a big DILL ;)
We stopped for breakfast and its the cutest little eatery. Full on bar and outside eating.

Of course we ordered a few pickles and they were all good.
I got a Bloody BLT and WOW it was amazing!

Breakfast is big enough to share. My hubby and I got eggs and bacon, but my sister in law got the Lemon Blueberry biscuit. OH YES, try it. It was yummy!

If we ever visit the city again, we will be back!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants

I always go here for brunch and the chicken and pancakes are a must have. The biscuits are also fire!!!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I admit, I bought into the five-star h y p e.
I went there twice, which means, after the first time I ran into the wall, I wasn't smart enough to avoid it a second time.
Food is okaay but ain't all that.
And they need to enforce consistent standards on service.
Their cousin further down Broadway seems to be the brinier of the two.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"It's not a bad restaurant by any means. Food was good and expectedly very heavy, however I wasn't impressed.  The food comes out barely warm. I liked their biscuits by itself, the gravy is tasty but I didn't really care for it, but that's a matter of preference as my husband really enjoyed it. Fried pickles are good. Now the hot chicken biscuit sandwich, the chicken was seasoned and fried well but the sauce this dish uses was very oily and it made the biscuit underneath too greasy to eat. The cheddar grits it came with was awfully gelatinous. I would try a different chicken sandwich next time and hopefully this was just a bad batch of grits.

I must say the service is phenomenal, especially given how busy it was.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"One of my favorite restaurants in the city. The portions are huge and the food is exceptional. I love the hot chicken biscuit here, the biscuit is really well made fluffy and far from dry and the pickles cut the richness of the dish perfectly. The fried chicken is a chicken with a zing, not spicy but definitely has personality. It's sandwiched between two slabs of biscuits with the pickle tucked in and grits on the side. Amazing!! I would recommend the classic Mac and cheese as well but you're definitely going to have to take it home if you order both. I would say this is a great place to share entrees because the portions are just so big.

I can't wait to come back and try the poutine! If you love a rustic yet modern restaurant with really unique takes on classic dishes, you would love this place.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"The best piece of advice I can offer is not to eat for at least a day before coming here. The portions are huge and you will eat every last drop!  It has become our absolute favorite for breakfast or brunch in the city. You know  you're in good hands when you sit and rave over your own meal while watching in envy as dish after dish is served to others around you. Do yourself a favor, try their signature Bloody Mary!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I love to come here for some good ole comforting brunch foods! Got the hot chicken and biscuit and the gravy and biscuit (gravy on the side). Super juicy and nicely seasoned chicken with a soft buttery biscuit. The Jam Jar was a perfect compliment to the meal, fresh strawberries with gin and lemonade! Amazing! The only disappointment, was actually the name's sake, pickles. My boyfriend grew up pickling and he was disappointed with the hot sours.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Hamburger Mac & Cheese was UNREAL! One of the best macs I've ever eaten. So flavorful and I've been let down a lot by Mac and Cheese at restaurants. Not this one!

Chicken BLT- great sauce!!! Fried green tomatoes crispy! Highly recommend.

App- biscuit basket. They're cut in squares and there were only 2, but gigantic. If you have more than two people get two baskets, unless you're with those very keto people then still get two and eat all the biscuits yourself. It comes with whipped butter, an amazing flavored butter, honey, and two jams to try. My mother waters now thinking about this.

A+++

Restaurant did have some nice 2000s jams pumping and it got kinda dark (could've also been the storm outside). I did see old people with their phone flashlights out reading the menu.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants

I had the Sausage Gravy Smothered Chicken and it was just amazing. Creamy, salty gravy over a crispy fried chicken over a buttery biscuit... sounds heavy huh but you'll want to eat every bite!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This spot is definitely southern comfort food! Biscuits, fried chicken, grits, collard greens, Mac n cheese, sweet tea, etc. Chicken is fried to a great crisp while being juicy on the inside, biscuits are fluffy, buttery and tasty, sweet tea is so good you'll need a refill every 5 minutes, and mac n cheese is top notch; right out the oven and served to you! For the portions you receive, this is by far one of  my top spots when it comes to prices. You will need a box when you leave. I haven't seen many people finish their plates. Prices range from $15-$23. Also, make sure when you're there get the fried pickles of course and candy red beets!
Con - Based on food, Jacob's is a 5, however the atmosphere is very dark. Dark to the point where you're fighting to see what's on your plate sometimes. Based  on that my true score for Jacob's would be a 4.5.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This is a great place to get a southern style brunch where the portions are huge and not shy in calories. Their corn bread is delicious and most of their entrees could be shared with a person or two. The only thing is that it gets super crowded and will probably have to wait quite awhile. The place is big and can be good for groups, but not a last minute thing. The service was good and I definitely would recommend this place to anyone! It's a classic for brunch and close to Central Park to walk off the food coma after!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"After having a less than spectacular experience at Maison Pickle, I was skeptical about eating at Jacob's Pickles. It's close to my boyfriend's new apartment and we were hungry so we took the gamble. We came on a Saturday night, right around peak dinner time. Surprisingly, we were seated right away.

First and foremost, the food is b.o.m.b [makes bomb sound effects]. I had the Honey Chicken Biscuit [$17] which comes with cheese grits. The farms they source their chickens from must have a workout regime. The piece of buttermilk fried chicken was the biggest I've seen in my life. While it was huge, it was also cooked expertly. It was incredibly juicy on the inside and fried to crispy perfection on the outside. The biscuit it came on, oh boy, that was a flakey, buttery biscuit. Lest I forget, the cheese grits tasted like Thanksgiving mashed potatoes minus the tryptophan-induced coma. This dish is literally all I can think about a few weeks later.

My boyfriend had the Chicken & Pancakes [$19]. He said he likes a version of this dish better at The Common in Brooklyn. Idk...his opinion doesn't count [I'm the worst].

I also had a cider, Graft Salt & Sand [$9], which is fruity and acidic. It's nice to drink something refreshing while eating something rich and heavy. He had the root beer, which he enjoyed. I do not like root beer.

Unfortunately, the air conditioner was not working. It was humid outside and not much better inside, even with the fans blowing. The cooling system dripped on our table as well as the table next to ours. It didn't seem like anyone cared all too much. In any event, we got a free shower.

Lucky that my boyfriend and I have been together for awhile. The restaurant is loud and we wouldn't be able to hear each other even if we wanted to. Service wasn't the most attentive as it was busy. This is definitely not somewhere you want to go on a first date, unless you do not plan on a second one. Come only if you can sit in awkward silence with your significant other and only want to shove friend chicken in your mouth unabashed.

Our meal was incredibly affordable- $64 after tax and tip. We were stuffed!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I'm a fan of sweet cocktails and I absolutely loved the 'Autumn Blush' cocktail. It's made with vodka and cranberry cinnamon simple syrup that's made in house!

For our appetizers, we got the Biscuits & Fixins and the Deviled Eggs.
The biscuits came with Strawberry Preserves, Orange Preserves, and Clover Honey in cute little squeeze bottles and small tubs of salted butter and maple butter. The pickled mustard seeds were a nice addition to the deviled eggs.  

We ordered the Shrimp & Grits, classic Mac & Cheese, and Hot Chicken Biscuit. The shrimp and grits had a nice smokey crayfish flavor in the sauce. It's a delicious dish, but note that the shrimp comes with the shells on.

The classic mac & cheese was great! Cheesy and creamy - just what I expect and love about mac and cheese. The hot chicken biscuit was a good dish, but not spectacular. The spicy hot chicken flavor did not come through and the biscuit was a tad dry.

Overall, this was a great meal! The winners were definitely the Deviled Eggs and the Autumn Blush cocktail.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"There's so much to do, see, eat, & drink in NYC, it's always tough to narrow down. Luckily, my Chicago pal, Mel B. helped with this one.

The place is easy to get to, and minimally stylish. As with most places in the city, expect to be close to your neighbors; space is a premium.

The menu is wonderful, just a variety of things to choose from. They're known for their pickles, the table next to us had an interesting selection, but we'd already stopped at a bakery before breakfast so I knew this wasn't the day for appetizers. I'll certainly give em a go on the next trip.

I enjoyed the bacon, egg & cheese biscuit. As you can see by the pic, it's the size of the plate! It's locally sourced, I appreciate that. The bacon is thick-sliced, and smoky--perfect against the creamy texture of the eggs, and the mild buttermilk flavor of the biscuit.

The service was perfection, never an empty coffee cup along with great recommendations. This breakfast was a win. I'll do it again. You should, too.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I have two dedicated dog mommy friends that wake up at 5 am (on a weekend) to walk their dogs around Central Park. After the walk, they get brunch and tell me all about it. Hello? Where is the invite? One day, I decided to join my friends afterwards around 9 am.

The minute I got there, there was already a line. They opened at 9 am and already a line. That already said a lot about the place.

My friends and I got two orders of hot fried chicken and shared it. OH MY LORD! I literally found myself greedily grabbing more chicken before I finished the one on my plate.

The dish comes with two large juicy chicken pieces perfectly fried after it has been brined in pickle juice and buttermilk. Then, it is doused with a hot sauce elixir that makes the already delicious chicken fabulous! Just when you think things can't get better, they top the chicken with a mound of thinly sliced pickles and serve creamy grits and biscuits on the side. Do yourself a favor and forget about the biscuit/ grits. Yes, they are good, but the chicken is the star and, Jesus Christmas, it is the best fried chicken I ever had. Actually, let's bring the grits/ biscuit back because the hot sauce needs something to sop it up. The thing I like about this dish is that the pickles cut into the greasey/ oily fried chicken so you don't feel so heavy afterwards. It gives you an illusion of lightness, but don't be fooled, it is not.

I had this last Sunday and I am already craving it already. My friend took the leftover bits home and I thought she was silly because there wasn't much left, but.... I was a fool. I should have fought her for the bit.

So I am on a plane on my way to New Orleans and as I was boarding the plane, I was telling my friend how I wished I had the chicken before we left the city and the lady in front of us was like ""Jacob's Pickle? I love that place!"" We instantly became friends. When you know, you know.

BUT! One thing, I got a side of pickled eggs because I thought about my friend's mom who makes bomb pickled eggs. Don't get it. It is a bit off... Hot chicken dish! You will think of me and scatter rose petals wherever I walk for giving you the best advice of all time.

For the first time in forever I was excited about a dish. Being a foodie obsessed with how things are made and just having a very particular preference, it is really hard to get me excited about certain things, but this one. Wow!

ALSO! After this, we got Levain bakery cookies so.... our day really couldn't go wrong even if we got hit by the car.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Amazing as usual. Came on a weekend day for brunch and had to wait approx 1 hour. The other time we came, we sat in 20 minutes only for 2 people. This place is almost always packed on the weekends and don't take reservations but you can walk around during the wait but just be 5 minutes away as that's the grace period after they text you.

1. Croque madame - 4.5/5. Large plate as their other plates, delicious combo of meat, eggs, carbs and cheese :)

2. Fried chicken and pancakes - 4.25/5. The chicken was amazing, crispy, hot, delicious. The pancakes were average and the carb/chicken ratio was heavy on the carb side.

Drinks are pricy as can be expected in NYC but their cocktails are strong as well. First time, I had a bellini but next time it was a rosemary drink.

Overall, I'd come back for even more brunch, especially after a good workout.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This place is truly worth all the hype!! Been here twice now and thoroughly enjoyed it both times; I always beg to come here for brunch when I'm the city!! The ambiance is super fun; there's loud (but not too loud) popular music playing and lots of groups of friends/family which makes for a homey feel. Staff is always super friendly and accommodating. Definitely a favorite NYC joint to visit when in the area.

There's practically always a wait on weekends for brunch but honestly, their mac and cheese alone would get me to wait 2+ hours to eat. BUT E's bar next door has bottomless for 2 hours plus great nachos if you do end up having to wait",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Yes - the place is lively and ""cool"".
No - the super long wait for brunch is not worth it.
Yes - if you have a reservation or just grab a table for lunch during weekday, please try it!
No - food is not THAT good.

Huge portions, which for me are insane by any means. But you can take away your leftovers, which makes me feel better.
Pickles are good and worth a try, we had 8 types for $18 (note: that is a lot of pickles).
Deviled eggs seemed a great option but we went for the fish tacos - good choice as well if you want a healthy alternative.
Coffee was good and refilled a lot of times, which I honestly enjoyed :)

Overall Jacob's Pickles is worth a try but not the peak-hour wait. Don't expect great food, expect comfort food. And be ready to eat too much :) so do come with the biggest appetite.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Absolutely LOVE this place. The food is not only presented really well, it is delicious, too. Can't go wrong with the meatloaf and the sweet/sour cukes.

My only complaint about this place is the blaring hip hop at all times. I love hip hop but, not sure why it needs to be so loud",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,If you're looking to be super indulgent this is your place. I've been here on multiple occasions and the food is very consistent (for the most part--one time it wasn't). It's smaller in the back and VERY loud so be prepared for that. But all in all I good dining experience.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Definitely a comfort food spot. The buffalo chicken Mac and cheese was really good...but definitely rich. I ordered the full size and barely made a dent in it (nice to have leftovers, though)!

Came for dinner on a Tuesday around 6 without a reservation and didn't have to wait, but I think typically it requires a reservation. As we were finishing up, we noticed a few groups waiting outside for tables to open up.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"AMAZING food and experience! Everything from the drinks, to the food, to the atmosphere, to our server Caroline. We both ate the Coop platter which consisted of the most delicious potatoes I've ever had, 3 fresh fried eggs, a biscuit, house made sausage patties (to die for), amazing bacon strips, and hands down the best grits I've ever had. Ask for the strawberry preserves to go with your biscuits ... fantastic. Our drinks were delicious. Loved the vibe of the place and the friendly staff. Prices fair for New York. Located close to Central Park west - convenient and easy to find! Can't wait to go back! Also can't wait to try one of their chicken dishes - the chicken looked insane!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This place is a delight. Situated in a corner at UWS this is a perfect spot for brunch. I really loved their biscuits which were served with butter and collection of jams. Note that the biscuits ain't the traditional ones, but still crumbly and melts in your mouth.

I really loved the cheese it was oozing in almost everything we ordered. The cheese fries were delicious, soggy but delicious. I would recommend the fried chicken which is lightly battered and crispy.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This seems to be the go to place for brunch. And it has every reason to.

So let's get on into my review

I went on a Sunday afternoon, it was a packed house. It's kinda of a who's who. Fashions galore mixed with tourist and people who just want to get there instagram photos. I think I waited a little over an hour to get into this place. The process is simple go make your way to the hostess give her your number and they will text you when the table is ready.

Tables arrangements here SUCK, I got seated basically in a cramped long picnic dinning room table. Where basically your right next other guests. This was the most uncomfortable seating arrangement you can imagine. I'm pretty sure it's built that way to pack people in like sardines and get them out quickly.

Overall the food is good to great but not amazing enough to come back on a jammed packed weekend, you must get any fried chicken biscuit. Also please start with the poutine that was my favorite dish it's a standout! Simply amazing.  End it with the half baked cookie.

Overall solid however I would go on an off hour to avoid those cramped chairs",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Late review but def a fan.

I doubt they still do it but when I went earlier in the year they had a special of Oreo French toast and it was bomb.

It was super soft and yummy and it was wildly sweet like I thought it would be. The portion was also insanely huge and I couldn't finish.

The place is big but I noticed they do get packed very quickly, I wouldn't mind coming back for lunch or dinner.

Our server was super friendly and that def helped make the experience more pleasant esp when they got busy. you didn't feel like you were just a table.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"The type of place where you can't go wrong picking anything (or everything) on the menu.. meatloaf,
Fried chicken sandwich or Gumbo!! All authentic Southern items paired with pickled apps and out of this world cocktail or beer menu. We had to wait an hour after a cute drink at the next door Tiki bar.. well worth it for a 5-star experience!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Jacob's Pickles doesn't need any more accolades since there's is usually a line and it's packed shoulder to shoulder.  It's noisy and dark if that's your vibe.  The fried chicken is amazing, big pieces and the best I think in New York.  Homey jams and biscuits complete the comfort seeking foodie.  It's not crazy expensive either, just good food and company!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Sooo goooodddd!!!! Highly recommend this brunch spot. We went on a Saturday around 9:30am and there was no wait for a party of two, but by 10:15am there was almost an hour wait for a table.

The food was absolutely amazing. The honey chicken biscuit was some of the best fried chicken I have ever had, and I'm from Nashville!! It came with pickles on top and a side of cheese grits. My friend got the banana chocolate chip pancakes that were also amazing.

The playlist was popping (early 2000s jams including Justin Timberlake, Gwen, Kelly Clarkson). It is a pretty loud restaurant but it's just because the place is super busy and has a lively energy.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I don't understand why people love this place so much. The food is not very good, really salty. It is terrible for vegetarians, which I understand its southern food, but we are in New York City, for such a well known restaurant in the location that it is, there should be at least one option. I had a biscuit and eggs, something I could have made at home and it would have tasted much better and been a fourth of the cost. The portion sizes are giant. It is so loud inside you can hardly have a conversation, and its not the fun boozy brunch loud it's just unnecessarily loud.

They do have good drinks! The cocktails are quite delicious. They are expensive, but drinks at brunch places are always about that price. I will not be coming back. But maybe someone with a stronger love for southern salty food would enjoy it.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"The food at Jacob's Pickles is delicious. The portions are very hearty, so you will definitely have food to go. I loved the chicken and pancakes... but everything is good on the menu. Please indulge in the fried Oreos!

Our server Dominique was phenomenal. She was responsive and very accommodating, she went above and beyond on an item we wanted but wasn't available.

It was my friends first time there. She loved it and said she was definitely going back. All around great experience!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I'm not an upper east side kinda gal but I was there.  Actually I was on the other side of the park. The menu looked good so I hopped a cab and went over.  

It was a Friday night. We scored seats at the bar just in time.  Mobs of people were there!  The bartenders kept up with drink orders with ease and grace.  The food had some waiting issue.

Rum & root beer - think rum and coke but with house brewed root beer.  Enjoyable.  
Hush Puppies - the size of golf balls. Tender. Fried crispy. Yum!
Chicken Thigh Basket - thank you thank you thank you! Someone has finally made a dish for dark meat lovers!!!!  I've never had a square biscuit the size of a CD album before but I would definitely have it again.  Collards were ok.  Mash potatoes with gravy were homey and delicious (no lumps!)  The fried chicken was HUGE. I believe it was butterflied, the skin was stretched and then it was deep fried. Perfection!  Lots of crunchy fried bits and tender chicken.  It took a while to come out of the kitchen.
Jar of pickles to go!  It's on the menu. We paid. Finished out drinks and waited 15 minutes for pickles.  Ok they did pack them in a ball jar. They were a gift and were enjoyed.

I'd go back for lunch.  Just can't deal with the evening vibe.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"An excellent higher-end dinner option in the UWS. Jacob's Pickles is well known for its massive portions, incredible food, and the famous mac and cheese. We tried a little bit of everything: biscuit appetizer with various butters and spreads, fried honey chicken biscuit with housemade pickles, and the buffalo chicken mac and cheese. Everything was so delicious! Prices on the higher side, but the portions and quality and taste of the food make up for that.

The interior is upscale and modern, with fully stocked bars and low lighting. However, due to its popularity, it's always crowded with wait times, and the tables are really packed, so you're uncomfortably close to other diners and could be sat at a long communal table. It was really loud and dark in the back dining area where we were seated, so I had to drop a star from this one. If it were just based on the taste of the food and friendly service, 5 stars all around.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Come hungry.  

We were hungry after a day of museum culture. So checking on Yelp, my friend discovers this spot. When we arrived around 5:30 pm on a Friday night, the place was very full. We managed to snag the only two seats at the bar. We were quickly greeted and handed menus.

The lemonade cocktail was perfect for the warm afternoon. Debbie had an interesting cocktail of house made root beer and rum.  The appetizer hush puppies are huge. They arrived fairly quickly, piping hot, crispy outside, and just plain delicious. We decided to share an entree. So glad we did. We got the chicken thigh basket. It took longer to get. It consisted of two large thighs with lots of crunchy coating, side of creamy mashed potatoes and gravy, collard greens and a biscuit with maple butter. That was a lot of food even for the two of us.
Getting a jar of their pickles to go also took a while, also asked a second time if they were coming soon.

Atmosphere on a Friday evening was crowded and quite loud between the music and the crowd. I suggest a table outside. Sitting at the bar you can get many people reaching around you to order drinks or bumping into your back as the crowd gathers.

Jacob's Pickles,"This is one of my favorite places to go in New York, especially if I'm in the mood for a hearty, large meal. I definitely recommend making reservations if you can, otherwise you may end up waiting a long time as a walk in. Jacob's Pickles is pretty popular on the weekends especially. We came in after a graduation, during graduation weekend, and we would not have gotten a table if we hadn't made a reservation several weeks prior, I'm sure. Our table was being cleaned off when we arrived, so we waited a few minutes after our scheduled time before sitting down - not too long though. We were a party of 7!

Our server was nice and dealt with the chaos of our group well. Even though he had a crazy busy section, he always came back at the right time and kept our drinks full which we appreciated as we were celebrating, with booze.
Food; appetizers and entrees that I tried,
Biscuits and fixings* so good
Buffalo Mac and cheese with buttermilk fried chicken
Veggie omelette add ham with breakfast potatoes

Because it was so busy, I'm really glad we ordered appetizers to hold us off until our entrees came out. The biscuits were little squares of heaven, and I loved all of the jams and butters that came with it. That being said, there weren't many biscuits - I think there were only 2, so we had to cut them up to ensure everyone got to try them. I wish it had come with 4 biscuits. Everything else came out as an enormous portion that made them easy to share. The flavors were pretty spot on too. Nobody had any complaints! I highly recommend eating here!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Great pickle place! It was the first day after days of rain... and we all know what that means in NYC! Plenty of outdoor space and raving reviews, we had to try it!

We got 4 different types of pickles, Mac and cheese with mushrooms (that's off the menu, but you can ask for it), and pickle & cheese patty melt. Ah, yes, let's not forget about the Morisou beer! A great fruity taste! And to complete the meal we had skillet cookie with ice creams.

Since we like pickles anyways we loved the pickle choices and their each individual flavors. Our hands down favorite were the special sours. No complaints there!

The pasta was good with plenty of cheese, but impossible to be eaten in one sitting (unless you really don't care about your cholesterol sky rocketing).

The patty was served on toasted flattened buns, which we liked a lot. Their French fries are great too! Our least favorite dish would have to be cookie. Although good, it kind of lack

The dishes itself are HUGE! We could have easily shared one dish. We sat outside and got pretty lucky by only waiting for the table 10 min? (Or less).
The inside is quite noisy and dark.

Overall great and reasonably priced spot. I wish they had more options for vegetarians. Definitely would go back for pickles!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Open the door on a quiet UWS street and it's like you've been transported back in time - early naughties to be precise.. classic RnB tracks jamming and everyone living it up!
What was ordered
- fried pickles - simple but holy crap!
- biscuit with sausage gravy - delicious but biscuit was more bread than biscuit (why the four stars)
- buffalo chicken Mac and cheese - got the small and that was too much! Flavor on point though.
- southern BLT - YES! Deliciousness on a plate
For sure will be back!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"The more I go to Jacob's Pickles, the more I like it and can see why it's so popular. My friend and I went on a Friday night so they were packed but the hostess was very accommodating and texted within 20-25 minutes when a table was ready. The last time I went here I solely ordered the appetizers so I decided to finally try the southern biscuit sandwiches the second time around. We got the fried pickles to start and it was as good as I had remembered it being before. Do take note that the pickles are sliced in the ""long way"" and are thick versus thin circular pieces (pardon my lack of eloquence). In regards to the biscuits, my friend got the hot chicken biscuit and I got the Southern BLT.

The portions. Dear god. Trust me when I say that I can eat but even I couldn't finish the whole biscuit. The plate is massive and the sandwich was, quite literally, the size of my face. And yes, portion size is not the only great part about it as it definitely fulfilled that comfort food craving that we have from time to time (or maybe that's just me). If I had to pick between the two, I would definitely go for the hot chicken biscuit instead of the Southern BLT. Not that the Southern BLT is bad, but it just had a little too much going on and lacked flavor (which is why I knocked off a star). The hot chicken, however, was simple (in the sense that it was ""just"" chicken, hot sauce, and pickles) and had a LOT more flavor. If I were to ever go back to Jacob's Pickles, I would definitely order this instead. Take note that all of the sandwiches are served with organic cheese grits, which, combined with a bite of the sandwich, might give you high cholesterol ins but it would totally be worth it :). Enjoy!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This may be the ""go to"" place for comfort food, but Jacob's Pickles is far from comfortable.

Although it was crowded on a Tuesday night, we were quickly seated near the front door, against the wall opposite the bar, a bit cramped. Worst of all was the noisy music blaring from the speakers just above our heads.  Human conversation was nearly impossible. I asked twice to please turn it down. It never happened.

After shouting our food order to the server, our meals arrived promptly. Maybe too prompt. My wife's salmon was undercooked (nearly raw).  They took it away.
Before they could bring it back, I had already finished my Nashville Hot Chicken ""sandwich.""  It was more of a chicken filet with a biscuit on top.   The hot seasoning was good, but the whole meal was swimming in the seasoned oil.  A little much.

My wife's salmon was good -- once it was cooked. At least, that's what I think she said. Our ears are still ringing.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,Get there early and expect a wait! This place is well worth the wait. Lots of great comfort food. The chicken biscuit with mushroom gravy was THE BEST. they had pumpkin pie French toast so we tried that as well. I would love to go back and try more items. Brunch is a must for this place.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"My go-to brunch spot when I have friends come into town, or I find out someone hasn't been here yet. This is a fabulous place to split a single order, the portions are HUGE. My highlights are the Mac & cheese, fried chicken brisket sandwich with pickles and honey, and the biscuits and gravy. My order suggestion would be to split the Mac & cheese and split a main order. You both will leave TOTALLY stuffed!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I've made so many mistakes when it comes to Jacob's Pickles...

I spent some time on the Upper West Side a couple years ago; Jacob's Pickles always popped up top of page when I searched for restaurants in my vicinity. I had the erroneous misconception of it being a stodgy, quiet eatery when the opposite is actually true. Jacob's Pickles has a booming energy that spills out onto the street. My first mistake is not coming in sooner.

A couple weeks ago I finally decided to try Jacob's Pickles on a Friday evening. Our wait time was minimal & when we were seated, it was at one of the communal picnic benches in the back room. This restaurant is more spacious than the crowded front bar area lead me to believe.

We each ordered a Southern biscuit fried chicken sandwich & soon saw how foolish we had been; the portions are such that three of us could have shared one (not that anyone's counting but this is mistake #2.) $17 each for my Honey Chicken & Pickles and the Hot Chicken Biscuit (you want this Nashville hot sauce!) & $18 for the Southern BLT which stars the incredible fried green tomato. All accompanied by an addictive side of salty, buttery grits.

Not ordering some variety of their namesake food (cukes, beets, carrots, jalapeños, even eggs, etc.), thinking the pickles on our sandwiches would suffice -- well, that was my third mistake. As tables received their orders of colorful pickled veggies, I resigned myself to my meal devoid of any pickley assortment.

My being a flawed individual benefits you. You now know to go to Jacob's Pickles ASAP, share the monster-sized southern biscuit sandwich, & order the pickles. It ain't called Jacob's Pickles for nothing.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"My husband and I ate at Jacob's Pickles three years ago and had such a good experience we had to make a stop here this time around. We ordered the Brussels sprouts, the Buffalo Chicken Mac n Cheese and the Honey Chicken and Pickles Biscuit Sandwich all we're out-of-this-world-good and lived up to our very high expectations from our first visit.

To describe the Mac n Cheese, my husband said, ""You know how there are some meals where one bit is better than another? Every single bite of this stuff is amazing."" It's flavor is spot on and the portion is HUGE! We ordered the smaller size and it could have easily fed both of us.

The Honey Chicken and Pickles sandwich was to die for. I'm typically the type of person who bashes Pickles and will stand ten feet away from anyone who has recently eaten one but these pickles were something else! They were so sweet and complimented the fried chicken and honey so well.

The Brussels sprouts were basically candy -- I could have eaten the whole pan.

We ordered way too much food for two people but that's a positive at JP's -- for NY city eating, you get a lotta bang for your buck.

Oh yeah -- and our server was FANTASTIC and the whole crew did such a good job at accommodating our infant child and gigantic stroller.

The only reason I don't give JP's a 5-star rating is because it was SO dark (like almost couldn't see what you were eating dark) and the music was very, very loud. For those reasons, I wouldn't necessarily say this is a great spot if you want conversation or to see your company.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This is the most ridiculous brunch. The portions are absolutely huge. When my friend and I arrived, we expected a long wait, but they turned over tables very quickly and we got in after about 10 minutes. The service was also much faster than expected! as far as food goes, our eyes were way bigger than our stomachs. My friend and I split poutine and got biscuits and gravy and the honey chicken and pickles for our entrees. Everything was delicious but we had a ton of food left!

The poutine and pickles were absolutely top knotch. I wish I had been able to save room for their special, an Oreo biscuit, but there's no way I could have eaten another bite. The only thing that could have been better were the grits. I'm a Kentucky girl who knows good grits and theirs were just okay.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Jacob's Pickles is a great spot for the Southern style comfort food that hits the soul in just the right spots. The warmth and charm of the restaurant envelops you as you dig into your fried chicken sandwich, but don't even make a dent after ten minutes. I ordered the Honey Fried Chicken and Pickles and it was enormous. The whole plate was more than enough for two meals. It doesn't just have one piece of fried chicken, but rather two generous slabs, sandwiched between two soft pieces of honey-soaked corn bread. The pickles have a sweet brine and have just a hint of sour to them. After savoring the crispy sweetness of my biscuit sandwich, I found myself admitting defeat and packing most of it to go. The side of cheesy grits also comes in a generous portion, but I don't like grits much and couldn't get on board with them. Even so, this was definitely a meal to remember!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants

The portions are huge and delicious! I ordered the chicken and pancakes with a side of cheese grits. The following emojis accurately describe that experience from beginning to end: .

The pancakes were ginormous and the chicken was perfectly fried. The crumbled bacon on top with the honey and homemade syrup were the perfect addition! I don't do leftovers, but I actually packed my leftovers up and took them home! The grits were actually good and creamy, not watery like all other grits I have found outside of the south.

The people next to me ordered Mac and cheese and omg it looked amazing. It was also huge and came cooked in its own pan which is what they served it in.

I want to go back and try everything else on the menu!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon at around 2:30. This place was packed inside and out with a ton of people waiting for tables. I put my name down for 2 and we were told 20-30 minutes...I found this place on Instagram and honestly was prepared to wait.

We got drinks at the bar and were given a seat at a  'communal table' after about 35 minutes which was honestly the worst part. The table was super packed and you're literally rubbing tables with a stranger...I got over it after my second spicy pickle margarita.

For starters, we shared the deviled eggs and the fried pickles. The eggs were amazing and the pickles were fried to perfection and the pickles super juicy.

For mains I had the hot chicken biscuit and my friend had the fried chicken Cesar. The hot chicken was the perfect amount of spicy and came with cheesy grits (I didn't think I liked grits but I guess I do now). The fried chicken salad is definitely not a diet salad, huge chunks of fried chicken and Parmesan biscuits make it such a indulgent salad.

Will definitely be back. Aside from being forced to sit next to strangers, the food and strong drinks make it totally worth it.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants

Jacob's Pickles,"The food and service actually deserve a 4.5, but I had to take a star off for ambiance. It was probably one of the loudest restaurants I've been to in a while. As much as I love and appreciate them playing Biggie over the stereo for his anniversary, it was so loud that my party of 7 were yelling at each other across the table. Also, the table/booth in the front where they sat us was really for 6ppl but they squeezed us in together and we barely had room to move. To top it off, they kept the front doors wide open  and yes, it was 52 degrees earlier that day, but come dinner time it had dropped to 40 and we were freezing our asses off so much we could barely focus on our food. Maybe it was their way of rushing people to leave since it was so crowded??

Shrimp and grits were tasty, and my fried chicken was on point. The Mac and Cheese made me shimmy my shoulders it was so good, and their hush puppies? We damn near fought over them at the table until someone smartly suggested we just place another order lol. Meatloaf was just ok - wouldn't order again.

The portion sizes are huge (even for the amount you're paying), 2. Most of the modern takes on dishes pan out as improvements rather than failures.

Despite the restaurant being named after their pickles, their SQUARE biscuits are incredible and soft!!! The fried pickles were okay. I believe the texture and perfect ratio of a traditional fried pickle is better than the ones that are served here.

Overall, this location is a dining experience you don't want to miss if you find yourself uptown- from seating outdoors, incredibly large amounts of food, and a different take on traditional southern food, I am sure you'll enjoy it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"If you're looking for a brunch place in the city, this one should 100% be on your list to try! Don't let the name fool you, even if you're not a fan of pickles, there are a ton of options that I'm sure you'll love! This restaurant is fairly big and can be a bit crowded/tight, but we came on a Friday for lunch and was seated immediately.

The portions here are huge so I would recommend coming with a large group and sharing everything. We ordered the croque madame, sausage gravy chicken biscuit, and french toast. It was biscuit EVERYTHING, but every dish had a good spin that made them all slightly different.

The croque madame was hands down my favorite and I'd recommend trying that! It has two thick slices of biscuits (shaped like bread) with a huge piece of fried chicken, egg, cheese and sauce all smothered in between. The biscuit on top was also covered in bacon and shredded cheese so you know this meal is loaded. It also came with a side of potatoes which were divine, I've never come across a place that offered breakfast potatoes that were cut into circles and fried with peppers.

The sausage gravy chicken biscuit was on the heavier side but nevertheless still delicious. I wish they had extra gravy since they do give you two fat pieces of chicken with the biscuits and you can always use more gravy with that. It comes with cheese grits and usually I'm not a fan of grits but it paired really well with the dish.

Lastly, the french toast with strawberries was essentially desert. This was a great take on biscuits because the outside was crispy and sweet and doesn't even taste like a biscuit anymore. I would recommend this plate!

Bring some stretchy pants because I guarantee you will be STUFFED after this glutinous meal. It's absolutely delicious and on the more affordable end if you share these huge portions and totally worth trying!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants

It was very loud in the benches but I can understand with the restaurant being jam-packed it made sense that we were squeezed in as much as we were.
I had the buttermilk chicken and the serving size was sooo big, I had left overs for breakfast the next morning. It was so very tasty and would recommend it to anyone! I only remembered to take pictures of the appetizer as when the main course came I jumped in as I was so very excited! Yum yum!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I absolutely love this place and have been here four times in the past few months. There is always a long wait to get in for brunch but my friends and I are always willing to wait/walk around for an hour to an hour and a half. The food does not disappoint. My favorites are the chicken sandwich with sausage gravy and the spicy chicken sandwich. The banana chocolate chip pancakes are so big and full of chocolate chips. The fried pickles are tasty, as are the regular pickles. Service can be slow, as it is a very popular spot but, if you're not in a rush it has an absolutely great atmosphere with delicious food! Can't wait for next time :)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Torn between 3 and 4 stars, but ultimately had to go with the lower due to our experience prior to being seated.

The entrees at Jacob's Pickles were great and I would still highly recommend the place. I had the sausage gravy smothered fried chicken and it was phenomenal. The grits that came as the side were pretty plain and nothing to rave about. My girlfriend had the cheeseburger mac which was also very good (and literally a full cast iron skillet's-worth)

Can confirm the portions are massive!

Working backwards though, things start going downhill. We tried the deviled eggs and the fried pickles for apps, and they weren't very good. The pickles were way to thinly sliced and all you could taste was the breading. The deviled eggs had a huge amount of yolk (both on top and a bed of it underneath) that was just too much, and it had a gritty texture.

When we arrived we were told there would be a 35 minute wait, and recieved a text message after waiting about that long. However, when you are texted and go to the hosts, they have you wait off to the side until your table is actually ready. This is a tiny, cramped area where you are constantly dodging waiters/waitresses while trying not to crowd the people seated around you. We waited for about 10 minutes with two other groups, and were told we could be seated at a table of 6 with 2 other parties, or would need to wait another 15. We chose to wait, but at this point have been waiting for over an hour total and are stuck in this terrible spot, becoming frustrated. Why can't people wait outside after they have been texted?

We waited an hour and 15 minutes in total to be seated, compared to the 35 minutes we were originally told. I know it's tough to estimate these things, but ths 35 minutes wasn't for our own table and never should have been told to us without noting that. Waiting in the cramped space for about a half hour was also a terrible experience and certainly doesnt help the wait staff

Luckily it was worth it for the amazing entree, but my girlfriend and I were frustrated and impatient by the time we were seated. I believe they could run a smoother operation in terms of getting people seated, and if it weren't for my experience with this JP would easily have recieved 4 stars",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Long wait as expected here! We were quoted 35-40 min around 6 pm on a Saturday. After called in because our table was ready, we waited an additional 30 min. Staff was friendly and apologetic, but I'm curious as to the disorganization??

Food came out promptly after ordering, so saving grace there! We enjoyed the deviled eggs, fried pickles, and special sours, although nothing to write home about.

I ordered the cheeseburger Mac, which was HUGE. Felt like two boxes of pasta, to be honest. Definitely didn't even make a dent, but it was good. Boyfriend's fried chicken / biscuit with sausage gravy was great. He housed it and I enjoyed the few bites he allowed me :)

Drinks were alright, would've loved some brine flights or something more creative, but they were good.

All in all, highs and lows. Would go back for the pickles!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,Biscuits and gravy was awesome. Chicken sandwich was great. I want it again this weekend.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Wowww this place was sooo good! First I hate pickles so I didn't have a single pickle so I can't review that.

Food: So flavor bomb in almost anything you order. I got the chicken Mac and cheese and it was game over for me. Awesome. I tried other plates cause we were in a big party and honestly there was nothing I didn't like. And the portions are huge!!!

Service/decor: Service was great and decor had a super cool hipster industrial vibe which was awesome!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I have mixed feelings about Jacob's Pickles. We went on a rainy day and didn't have to wait to sit down. I outlined below some of my thoughts, as there are different ratings for different parts of the meal.

5/5- Pickled vegetables- oh my gosh, may favorite part of the meal for sure. The pickled vegetables are incredible and you can order a bunch of different types of vegetables. The carrots are so good, I mean they are all so good.

5/5- Bloody Mary- amazing, also has some veggies on it that are pickled, which again delicious

2/5 Fried Chicken Cesar Salad- not great at all. The lettuce was terrible, it was pretty much all romaine hearts that were red and not fresh. So much so that I started taking them out and I had a plate staked high. The chicken was the only good part

2/5- Service was not great, after seeing that my salad wasn't great the waitress didn't do anything. She was pretty rude honestly. She did come back at the end of the meal and said that she was going to get us an order of fried Oreos because my salad was bad. We were stuffed and didn't want the Oreos, if anything my salad should have been comped. She said that's what she could do and brought the Oreos, which we didn't eat as we had said we didn't want them.

My mom got the chicken and waffles and really liked the chicken, the portion size was huge.

Honestly I would go here for the veggies/Bloody Mary again, the vegetable were the best. Hard to recommend based on the other parts of the review.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"New York City hot spot.  Food was good.  Big on carbohydrates in all dishes.  Long wait and very noisy.  Sharing tables for most seating.  Known for biscuits, pancakes and chicken.  Recommend at least once for everyone to dine here.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I'm so glad I came here for brunch! My friends and I waited about 50 minutes for a table which wasn't too bad. The place was cozy and warm, and the employees were very nice.
We ended up getting the biscuits with eggs and gravy, I was told that the biscuits were amazing!
My friend got the buffalo Mac and cheese. And holy shit, it was delicious! It was so well flavored and perfectly cooked, best Mac and cheese I've ever had!
Lastly, I ordered the veggie omelet with had Browns. The omelet was fine but the home fries were perfectly cooked; they were nice and crisp.
This place is definitely worth the wait.
The wait is long, but there's a levains cookie not too far from here.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Went with a friend... Of course we ordered the buffalo Mac n cheese as it's my favorite item on the menu... delicious as usual! Keep in mind this dish is very rich and the small portion ($16) is more than enough food for 2 guys with another main course. For the other course we tried the lettuce wedge salad with fried chicken....Also awesome!! Very flavorful, perfect fried chicken, tasty salad etc! Service great as always. Once again, a very unhealthy, super tasty dinner!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This is my all time favorite place. They hands down have the best food and it's always busy which shows how good the food is. I got the hot chicken biscuit which was Spicey and it comes with grits on the side. My friend got the spiced shrimp market kale salad which she liked, but the shrimp had the heads on them. Overall great atmosphere, will definitely be back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"The popularity of this place does not excuse the heinous actions of these ""medieval land aggressors."" They have burgeoned out onto the street with tables blocking all traffic! They have extended their tables to the north and south east end of the sidewalk! I just went to pick up a take out order and it was impossible to social distance! They have turned the west side of Amsterdam Avenue from 84th Street to 85th Street into CONEY ISLAND or worse. BUT THE WORST IS THAT THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO STEAL THE LEASE OF A LITTLE SHOP RUN BY A NICE OLD MAN WHO WAS NOT OFFERED A RENEWAL LEASE!

Jacob's Pickles,"First found this place just looking up ""brunch places manhattan"". One of the best brunch places I've ever been to. I've been there upward 10x for their mac & cheese and huge biscuit banana chocolate pancakes. Their food is reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. They're known for their pickles (obviously) and you can order beer with almost any meal. Calm, hippy Brooklyn vibe, but on the Upper West Side. Overall, 10/10.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I came here with my Gf on a date. Jacob's is a restaurant serving comfort foods from the American south. Portions are uuuuuggeee as certain orange people would say, prices are very reasonable, and the flavor packs a punch!

We came at 1130 on a holiday and there was a 15 minute queue. We ended up going to Le vain bakery for some cookies. Service is very friendly and accommodating, and they have good suggestions.

Pickle assortment - if you order pickles, be prepared for a lot of fermented treats, and not just in the cucumber type! We got all cucumbers and carrots. Hot and sour, dill, sours and carrots.
Deviled eggs - very picturesque with a lot of yolk. Topped with mustard seeds. Goes good with the uuugee amount of picked we had
Spicy chicken sandwich - very large butter biscuit encapsulated fried chicken with a kick. Could have had a bit more chicken, as the breading is impressive. Comes with pickles and cheesy grits, not too strong but creamy.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,The food here is always great. Expect to always wait. The service is also okay. Only thing I don't like is that when u are seated at the front when it winter... it's cold.

Jacob's Pickles,"I came in for brunch here this past weekend after running a race in NYC. I went to Maison pickle a couple weekends ago and have been dying to try this place since then. I came in around 10 and it was starting to get really crowded. I got the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit with a side of cheese grits. I'm from the south, so I can't say the biscuit was my favorite. The whole biscuit was a bit salty - I think it was the freshly grated cheese which was delicious but there was so much. The cheese grits were absolutely delicious. I personally prefer Maison pickle, but this was a good choice too. It's a one meal for the day sorta place, so come hungry.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"So my rating will never change. NEVER!!
but I'll keep reviewing because every visit is so wonderfully exceptional.
I haven't been here since December 2016. I know, I'm terrible.
The fact that this visit was the first time I checked-in was riduc, but clearly I've got the reviews to prove the number of visits.
I came after brunch on a Sunday. I started off with a Flying mule (with aviation gin) and boy was it strong AF. Delicious but strong. Obviously I had to get a second one. Obvi.
To eat, I ventered out and ordered the Caesar salad with fried chicken. Yum!! Out came with biscuit cheese bread that was delicious. The portions are insane and even for a bulimic, it's a lot (today was my binge day and I failed).
The service was great! Especially the bartender who got my first drink and who clearly reads Mr mind because just as I was thinking about water, he gives me a glass of water.
This place will always be my number one in the world.
Finally bought a shirt. Can't wait to wear it. It comes with a mason jar!! The shirt feels so freaking soft",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,This spot is fun! It's a bit over priced and the food is good but not as great as everyone told me it would be. I live in New York and I'd say this is a great spot for tourists (and that seemed to be who was in line with us)! We had a good meal and enjoyed everything. The servings are giant and very heavy so no need to order a ton or different things. The vibe inside is great and loved that!! Service was great!,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I FINALLY had the chance to visit Jacob's Pickles on a Saturday morning. After hearing about the fire they had a few months back and their subsequent comeback to the UWS I knew I'd have to end up dining here one day. Well that day finally came and after all is said and done I can only say that I'm only upset it didn't come sooner!

We arrived around 11 AM and had previously made a reservation for a party of two. When I walked in I was surprised with how INSANELY busy it was. Seriously, don't come here without making a reservation. By the time we arrived wait times were in the 45 to hour range.

When our spot was ready the hostess walked us to the back of the restaurant and sat us at one of the long communal tables in the back. The restaurant seems to be broken up into three main sections, the covered patio, the booth and bar area, and the back section. Music is blasting throughout, but it seems a little more diluted in the back. If you're looking for a spot where you'll be able to hear your conversation though, may be best to look elsewhere.

When it came time to order I went with the sausage gravy smothered chicken ($17) while my friend got the croque madame ($18). The sausage gravy was legit excellent. Large portions, well cooked, and smothered in amazing sauce it didn't disappoint in the slightest. I'd definitely recommend the dish if you're looking for something poultry based that'll leave you both filled and satisfied.

Even though this spot was completely packed when we were there the service was just as good as the food! Our waitress made sure to answer any questions we had and also brought out our food quickly after we placed our orders.

This is definitely a great spot to grab a brunch with friends. Make an early reservation and try to score a spot towards the front of the restaurant for a more comfortable setting!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This has been on my list for a while. The staff, ability to sit outside and HUGE portions did not disappoint. Everyone was super helpful.
Try the Rosemary Lemonade. It's a summer dream cocktail. Just hit the spot!  The biscuits are fluffy and the honey and jams just right. The cheesey grits the best I've ever had!  If you like a spicy pickle, you'll be happy!  The fries, fried green tomatoes and chicken A southern throwback.
Be sure to take home your leftovers...I know you'll want them later!  It's worth wait.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants

Jacob's Pickles,"My friends and I came to this trendy little place on a Thursday evening, and though it seemed to be packed we were seated quickly. The servers were nice and the service was fast. I got the Southern BLT, which I'd say was good but probably not worth the price it was. It was tasty for sure, but really heavy and the fried green tomato had no flavor. The fried chicken itself was delicious and incredibly tender. In some ways, the price was worth it because the food lasted me 2 and a half meals.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Our NYC native insisted that we visit this place on our most recent trip, and provided door-to-door service for the pleasure of going there with us.  I had feared two hour wait times considering we got there at like 9:30, but we were ushered inside within ten minutes of arrival, which seemed like a NYC brunch dream.  The place is crowded. When you can't get out of your table without the table behind you standing up and getting out of theirs (and vice versa, for all parties, regardless of size), you have probably over-pushed your occupancy.

However, we didn't care about that so much once we were seated and our delicious food came. My sister and I split the banana chocolate pancakes, heavenly, decadent and too much and the sausage, egg and cheese biscuit, which was perfectly made. The sprinkle of cheese, the softness of the biscuit; everything on that plate was incredible.  

Add to that a biscuit smothered in their delicious, squirt-able jam and the BEST breakfast potatoes I've ever tasted (crispy, seasoned, quality worth angering friends kill your friends for as you steal from their plate), Jacob's Pickles is a place work risking that two hour wait for.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants

Jacob's Pickles,"Best comfort southern style food in the city. My go to when I need a pick me up or hangover food. The waitstaff has always been super cool.

That being said tonight's experience has left me never wanting to return. I came in and put my name down for a table of 3. We were told it would be about a 30min wait but we were willing to chill at the bar so nbd. We eventually get our table after a few awkward mix ups with the host (it was super loud and crowded and it was to be expected). Once sat our party ordered 2 appetizers (fried pickles and poutine, both go tos) 3 meals and 3 rounds of drinks.

As we were finishing our last round of drinks the manager comes over and word for word says, ""so you guys are going to leave soon right?""

To which we respond, ""yep, just finishing up, we'll be out of here soon""

""No but like soon, soon"" in a very curt manner. As if we were not a table of customers who had just ordered $300 worth of food from this establishment. 2 out of three of us work in restaurants and decided that though she handled the situation in the most unprofessional and disrespectful way possible we would finish our drinks, go to the restroom, and head out.

While we took turns using the restroom (because we all wanted to finished our drinks as well) this manager made a point of casting is mean looks at us and came over to the table 2 additional times to say that there was a reservation for that table and we needed to leave. Something that would have been fine if we were notified at our seating about a time limit as is customary in most ny restaurants.

It literally took one of our party to call her out on her lack of professionalism for her to finally offer us another table if we'd be willing to move (how this entire conversation should have started). As she said this our last person returned from the restroom and we left because there was no way we would be giving this restaurant anymore more money for they way we were treated.

If you have a set reservation and want to fill a table before that, I get it. But let your guests know first. That way they can plan their meal around it. Telling people ""you have 10mins to finish up and move"" (another direct quote) is not the right way to handle this situation.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,We were riding bikes in the area and decided to find a bite to eat. After a quick yelp search we decided to check out Jacobs. It was pretty packed but we were seated in about 10 minutes. We decided to do outdoor seating since it was a nice day. We started off with an appetizer: biscuits. They were huge and delicious (we got an assortment of jams - our fave was the honey butter). I got the pancakes and chicken which was huge! I could barely eat 1/3 of it. It was decent but I've definitely had better. It was a cool ambiance and a good vibe.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Legit 5's accross the board. Atmosphere, service, food, serving plates and cups.  There are long wooden tables that remind one of the old Durgan Park @ Faneuil Hall in Boston, but where that atmosphere is of a New England village seafood house, Jacob's Pickles is all New York style. From the dark wood furniture to the comforting semi loud music to the mason jars used as glasses. One immediately is feeling that they are involved in an experience instead of just getting a bite to eat.  Fried Pickles, obviously homemade biscuits (with delicious accompaniments - the walnut butter is heaven), and a sautéed Brussels sprouts dish were more than enough for two people and had our tastebuds singing. Pricing is good and the portions are large. A truly solid 5!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Heaven on Earth!
There's usually a wait to be seated (I'Ve never been lucky enough to walk right in to a table) but you can sit at the bar have a drink, start with appetizers if you want or just socialize and chit chat with others or the knowledgeable bartenders. They know they're drinks and won't steer you wrong. Once seated I have no problem. A creature of habit and so I go for my usual dish, buffalo chicken Mac and cheese. It may appear small but I've never been able to complete it in one sitting. More points for this place! The gumbo is good too, seasoned just right, I had a taste of that too and it was delic! The deviled eggs are amazing...And the Jam Jar.... oh the Jam Jar!!! Let's just say the wait is worth it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I came to Jacob's Pickles for brunch with two others on a Saturday morning. We put our names down at 10:30 and were seated about 15 min later. It was bustling inside making it a little bit difficult to get past everyone and to our table. Our waiter was nice and gave us plenty of time to decide what to order since everything sounds and looks delicious.

We started off the with a round of pickles, the 4 options for $15, candy red beets, hot sour cukes, sour green tomatoes and thyme jalapeños. The green tomatoes were a unanimous favorite - the texture took us by surprise as we thought it'd be slightly mushy having been pickled but they were crunchy! If you like heat go for the thyme jalapeños.

For our entrees my friends had the pancakes with chicken (upgraded to chocolate banana pancakes with bacon bits on top ) and the croque madame, while I had the hot chicken biscuit.

I didn't try the croque madame but I did have a bite of the home fries on the side which were delish! My friend enjoyed the dish. However, he said it was delivered not piping hot, as if it had been sitting just a bit before the other entrees were ready. No biggie though!

The pancake dish was enormous and filled with so much banana and topped with so much chocolate! I actually could've done without that amount of choco as it makes the dish too sweet and takes away from the savory factor of the chicken. But the texture was great, fluffy and light the way pancakes should be. The chicken was great too. Juicy, moist and not oily but I had a hard time getting past the fact that there was chocolate on my chicken. It didn't work well for me. Portions are large enough for a second meal (maybe even a small third meal).

The hot chicken biscuit...oh my. I had a difficult time figuring out what to order but I was so glad I went with this dish. Two very large pieces of chicken, large square biscuit, cheese grits on the side, Nashville hot sauce and hot sour pickles. That Nashville hot sauce - I could put that sh*t on everything - and it worked especially well with a bite of the fried chicken and hot sour pickles. My only qualm was the biscuit. It was sliced in half with the bottom half being used as a barrier from the chicken and all the hot sauce on the plate. That half ended up getting soaked in the hot sauce oil, crumbling and being inedible. It would've worked better if both halves were sitting on top of the chicken. Cheese grits were a home run!

We had a great time at Jacob's. As we were doggy bagging our leftovers, I'm guessing the manager saw me trying to get the remnants of the hot sauce into my container. She was nice enough to offer me a separate container of hot sauce to go!! Thank you!! For the quality and amount of food received, the price can't be beat. I'll be back to try more of the dishes.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,OVERHYPED & HORRIBLE. Came here while on vacation in NY & wow this place was no good. I got the chicken and pancakes. The chicken was rather soggy with the breading falling off and also looked white rather than crispy fried chicken. Seems like the chicken was undercooked. Pancakes were very doughy.. felt like they needed to be left a little longer on the griddle. My boyfriends food was even worse. He got the nashville chicken biscuit. The biscuit was soaked in grease and it was not a biscuit anymore when he went to pick it up. It was a soggy soaked grease piece of biscuit. Horrible food. Waited over an hour to eat junk. Buffalo mac and cheese had the consistently of really thick unmelted cheese. Don't recommend this place at all.

Jacob's Pickles,"I always take visitors to Jacob's Pickles or the sister restaurant, Maison Pickle.

The portions are quite generous and the prices are beyond fair. One may even say the prices are cheap  for Manhattan given the quantity of food you receive.

I don't even like pickles, but the fried pickles are great! They're super thinly sliced, so they're super crispy!

I highly recommend trying the biscuit sandwiches. I've really liked the Sausage Gravy Smothered Chicken sandwich (I tried and mushroom one and it was fine, but not quite as good). I also really like the Hot Chicken Biscuit sandwich, too.

If you have a big group or are fine taking home piles of food, I would also recommend checking out the meatballs on the starter menu and the biscuits and gravy if you don't go for the biscuit sandwich.

I'm lactose sensitive, so the mac and cheese and I haven't had a long experience, but my cheese loving friends give it two thumbs up, especially the buffalo chicken mac and cheese.

On the brunch menu, I have tried the chicken and pancakes and I thought it was just okay. Since that time, I usually order a sandwich even at brunch",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants

Jacob's Pickles,"I first off, the service was good even though the server was new. He was a little awkward but prompt.

i had the hot chicken biscuit and the mushroom gravy mash instead of grits. Pros- the biscuit was delicate and buttery delicious. The pickles were also great. They have a boutique root beer that was great. The mash was delicious.

Cons- the chicken was a little less than lukewarm when I got it. Also, waaaayy too oily. Like, after I was done there was a soup of oil on the plate. The chicken was barely spicy, and I love my heat. It was still good, but these are pretty big sins.

Also, they had really irritating basic ass pop music blasting during the meal. Im sure im not the only one who gets a headache from katy perry and then ariana and then whoever the fuck else that sounds the same.

One half star taken for music. One and a half taken for food sins. Otherwise worth a visit I guess.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants

It was huge, you will most definitely be leaving with a doggy bag. The ambiance is nice, it's a bit dark so my dad used his phone light to read the menu so keep that in mind. The service was fantastic, our waiter was very helpful about giving suggestions on what to eat, there were so many options I didn't know what to chose! He suggested I get the classic buttermilk fried chicken and I am so happy I listened!
My entree was unbelievable! I love pickles and on top of the fried chicken it was delicious! The grits on the side were so amazing I could have just eaten the grits as my entree. They were so buttery and flavorful. My dad said his burger was cooked just right and again had lots of flavor!
All in all this place is definitely one that we will come back to, he still talks about it!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,Came here for my boyfriend birthday and this place didn't let down. The food was delicious and service was super friendly. It's definitely big portions but they let you know this in the beginning before ordering. We also got the root beer float which came with extra soda and it was delicious. Definitely a place to come back for comfort food.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"#SMH ‍ Ok, I'm ashamed!! Life is about owning and accepting your idiosyncrasies; and being Accountable when you screw up! I live on the UWS for over 30 tears, and never heard of Jacob's Pickles until Chef Guy Fieri featured this remarkable eatery on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives! In that same vein (The Law of Attraction) I saw an episode of Chopped, AND Chef Glenroy Brown appeared on my #1 show...CHOPPED!! Are you serious...!!?? ‍ Daah!! I ran fast and furious to Jacob's Pickles and ordered the AMAZING Buttermilk Fried Chicken Caesar Salad  and it was UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS ! I do miss and definitely look forward to a sit down meal sooner than later!! But, they do offer take out!! Much love  $ hugs",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Overall, great experience!  
Our waitress, Hanna, did a fantastic job.  She was very nice and kept our table well served.  
I had the Hush Puppies for starters, and they were really good.  Then I had the chicken breast w/ French Fries.  Now this is more of a chicken fried chicken meal and it is pretty darn good.  
Overall all, nice restaurant w/ a few seats outside as well to enjoy those great New York sunny days!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"LOVEE JACOBS PICKLES!! Honestly one of the best brunch spots ever. If you don't get here after 10:45/11AM - you will have to wait in line and gets super packed. Thank goodness I live only few blocks away and can escape the line/wait. OR make a reservations in advance. They have a sister restaurant called Mason's Pickle too.

I didn't get their mac&cheese but I've heard its really good. I'd share with someone and get other entrees too so you're able to try other dishes. AMAZING blood marys too.

Things I ordered:
- SAUSAGE GRAVY SMOTHERED CHICKEN
Buttermilk Fried Chicken 16 (MUST GET!!!)
- WESTERN-CHEESE OMELETTE Black Forrest Ham,
Green Peppers, Spanish Onions, Aged Vermont Cheddar,
Home Fries 14 (not bad but would get something else)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Dope vibes, good music, awesome service.

We ordered:
* Brussel sprouts - these were ok
* Buttermilk fried chicken smothered in gravy - this was amazing! But so filling and massive. I shared this plate with a friend and we couldn't even finish it
* Buffalo Mac and cheese - Fire! I loved. Has a good kick to it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Came here on a Thursday night around 6:30 and it was on the brink of becoming packed. They emphasize seating until your whole party is there btw. I was seated promptly and our server was nice and swift. I ordered the honey chicken and got fries instead of fries. The chicken was fried and seasoned to perfection and on a biscuit that was soft and so tasty. The fries were also amazing and plentiful, I did not finish it. My cousin got the fried chicken Cesar salad and she loved it ! We got fried Oreos as a dessert and it was perfect. Love it here. Will definitely be back.

(The drinks are great too. Expect to spend more than. $14 on it)

The place is kinda loud (the music) found myself raising my voice/scream. So maybe not the ideal in intimate setting  or business dinner. But the food is amazing so it made that con okay.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,Got the Honey Chicken Sandwich and Mac N Cheese combo which was $21.  Was enough food for two people. Biscuits and chicken made fresh from scratch behind the counter.  Got the fried pickles also which came with a spicy mayo dipping sauce.   I dipped the chicken in the sauce it was so good. Definitely recommend this spot in the market!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,Waiter was awesome food was good would like to try something different. i do suggest not  getting the fish tacos just not good.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Came for dinner with three other friends and we only ordered two entrees to share! As many yelpers have mentioned the portions are really hardy and one plate can definitely be shared between two people! We came in the early afternoon and did not have to wait in line for a table.

We all split the fired green tomatoes to start. They were pretty tasty and had an interesting texture since they are coated in grits.

We also had the honey chicken with pickles which I was s little hesitant about at first. However, something about sweet honey on sour pickles just worked. The chicken is also pretty good very generously coated in breading. The dish also came with a side of buttery and cheesy grits. I found myself dipping bits of chicken into the grits for an extra flavor kick!

If you can catch them on a not so busy day it's definitely worth a shot!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Anyone visiting NYC or living in NYC should come here!

We found this place because I needed pickles for leg cramps from waking 17 miles a day in NYC!  What a jewel this place is!  I am so sorry we discovered it 1 day before we left because there were more things on the menu I would like to try!
I am a foodie from San Francisco and fell in love with this place!  The staff was the best in NYC, and we ATE our way through NYC so I am a good judge.  I had to find the best of everything and did.  I was so impressed with the staff and the food, I found the owner to congratulate him on such an impressive establishment!
Please open one in San Francisco!  You would be a hit!  You know many known chefs can't make in SF as we are tough critics, but this place would!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"5 stars for the food - absolutely fabulous.
3 stars for atmosphere - loud as all hell. Don't expect to have a real conversation over dinner. Once seated, you'll probably be in the lap of the patrons next to you.
3 stars for wait time - What can I say? They need a better system.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Still 5 stars. Everything in my original review still stands.

But I had something different, so I had to review it!

This time, I had the meatloaf and it was FANTASTIC. It was covered in gravy and fried onions - dreams do come true.

This time I went with a friend around 5 on a Saturday and we didn't have a wait. I asked about reservations and they let me know that they only take reservations for parties of six or more. So keep that in mind with your planning.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Amazing BISCUITS!!! The biscuits are buttery, soft, fluffy, airy and topped off with just the right amount of maple butter. They are seriously the best biscuits I've ever had. You can buy the biscuits in a 4 pack to go for $9 and they have a variety of jams/butter you can purchase to go as well.

I ordered the fried chicken basket that came with mashed potatoes, collard greens, 2 big pieces of fried chicken, a side of pickles and a big biscuit. the portions were generous for $23 and I shared with another person. The chicken was fried to perfection - a crunchy layer on the outside with juicy chicken on the inside. The collard greens have chunks of pulled pork in it. I did not like the mashed potatoes as much as I liked the other sides even though mashed potatoes Is one of my favorite sides in general. Something about the mashed potatoes tasted a little cardboard-y but the gravy was able to mask the weird taste a little. This is a great dish to get if you want to sample a little bit of everything. Definitely want to try one of their more unique dishes next time such as the fried chicken and pancakes!

Service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and gave us many recommendations on what to order. We went on a Sunday around 5 pm and I did not have to wait for a table. It was very packed and they have fun music playing that keeps the vibe energetic and exciting.

Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for quality southern comfort food!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,I was pretty upset with what happened tonight.  I called 5x before someone even answered the phone to place my take out (mind you I kept getting transferred to voicemail) before someone picked up. Finally I spoke to someone who took my order and told me to come in 10 minutes. My husband waited over 40 minutes to get the order and was not feeling great (as I would have gone out myself to get it). Quite disappointed. We love this place food wise but it didn't par up tonight.,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"So so good. Went for brunch on a Saturday and had to wait about an hour. We went to another nearby bar to grab a drink while waiting. The food and cocktails were totally worth it!

I got the chicken and pancakes, which was amazing. Pancakes were so fluffy and perfect. Chicken was tender and outside was crispy! I'm usually more of a savory person but when the waiter said that this was one of their signature dishes, I had to try it. My friend got the chicken BEC biscuit and it was very good. It was almost heavier than the chicken and pancakes due to the mountain of cheese and two biscuits! Subbed out the grits for home fries which were awesome.

I got the rosemary vodka lemonade which was amazing. My friend got some cranberry cocktail which was also awesome. Hope to come back again and try something else, I feel like you can't go wrong with whatever you order!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Father's Day Brunch - by 10:20 there was already a line out the door and a 20 minute wait (both promising signs about the meal to come). We were seated towards the end of a LONG communal table in the back of the restaurant, it's narrow squeezing in between diners.

Great music playing and chipper service was in abundance as we fired off our order.

Portions are ENORMOUS.  I mean HUGE.  The poutine could have fed 8 people, after hacking away at it for 15 minutes we barley made a dent. The heap of fries & cheese (dear gravy, you were missed).....

Nashville hot chicken biscuit is misleading, it's 2 fried chicken breasts on top of a biscuit like item, this is a meal, not a sandwich. It was pretty good chicken, breading a little much for me but the biscuit was a whole lot of nothing to talk about. Cheese grits may have been great but that's not my thing.

Star of the meal were the pickled spicy string beans, I'd come back for those and a cocktail but the food isn't being me back anytime soon.

All in all Happy we went...",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants

Food is scrumptious.  You will return",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Unfortunately this rating has nothing to do with their food. I went in on a Sunday night around 6:45 and asked for a table for two. They said it'd be about a 15 minute wait. So that was fine. Well, at 7:30 we left because we still didn't have a table and the music was so loud that we couldn't even hear each other talking. I asked if they could turn it down and I was told there is no volume control on the system. All the food I saw being delivered looked fantastic and it's a bummer I didn't get to eat any of it. I'll probably come back in the spring when I can sit outside and not have all conversation drowned out by over-loud music.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This place is so bomb.  Always has been, always will be.  

I've come here a few times over the years.  The wait is insane, so swing by, put your name in, and prepare to stay local but come back in an hour or more on weekends for brunch.

Do their version poutine.  The bloody Mary's are a must do with in house picked veggies and brine.

Get one of the egg sandwiches on a biscuit, and while you're at it cheesy grits on the side (you're welcome).

This place is easily a 4.5, but giving it a straight 5 is a little challenging because it's always so crowded and insanely loud (not just the people, but the musics at that uncomfortable level where you're not drunk enough, it's light outside, and you actually want to hear what the person next to you is saying without shouting like you're in a club).  

Good news is:  service (bar and tables) is pretty good-especially for the insane crowd, they keep their cool.  Portions are beyond, so think about splitting something or plan to go home with leftovers!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I was super please when Jacob's Pickles decided to jump on the delivery bandwagon with the current covid crisis, however was extremely dissapointed with the quality of their starters and dessert. First off, for an $11 order of fried pickles, I received only 6 pieces of the smallest slithers of pickles I've ever had. Each slither was smaller than my pinky finger and half the fried batter has slipped off the pickles. For dessert we ordered the biscuit butter pudding, what seemed like biscuit dough simply thrown into a plastic container and then microwaved. The pudding was moulded to the shape of the plastic container. It was inedible. Very unfortunate because we're regular dine in customer at this joint and the portions are typically generous and the food is usually delicious despite the very long wait times.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"If you visit NYC this is a must.   Tucked in the Upper West Side, is this amazing place.  The portions are extremely hearty so heads up you may want to split something.  If you don't, there will plenty of leftovers.  I had the pancakes and chicken and devoured maybe half.  I was fortunate enough to try the buffalo Mac n cheese and Ohhhh Emmmm Geee.....  

Anyway, I wanted to say that I enjoyed immensely eating here but I didn't like the to go that I got a couple of days later from their Brooklyn location.  The Mac n cheese was swimming in grease.   Hoping this honest post will help them correct that.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Yee haw love this place! Can't wait to come back in! I have family coming to visit and we are definitely going to pop in here for a bite!
So glad there is a place like this close by.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I will start out that we were very excited to try this restaurant on our recent trip.  Great atmosphere but quickly it went south when we were seated next to some pipes that were wrapped in something but not completely wrapped. To my surprise they were hot and my son accidentally hit his arms on the pipe. Needless to say we started out with a stinging hot pipe and after that it was hard for me to enjoy the meal.

Food my son and partner enjoyed their food overall it just feels like they are trying too hard. Keep it simple and deliver great food.  The pancake and fried chicken was delicious but covered in some type of dry crackling it was very weird. Once that was off of it, it was amazing. Partner had sausage gravy over fried chicken and he said it was delicious. I had shrimp and grits and all I can say is no, DO NOT ORDER, this was terrible.  I'm not sure they really used grits. I have never had grits that taste and look like mush. It was horrible and there is nothing else to say.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Wow this place was amazing!! I came here on a Friday around noon and had to wait 45 minutes, but it was totally worth it. We ordered the big dill pickles and they were perfectly crisp and sour.

You have to try the biscuits here too. They're unlike any biscuit I've ever had!!!! So fluffy on the inside but crispy on the outside. I got it with mushroom gravy and was so happy with it. Must try!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"So I love pickles and immediately off of the name felt intrigued to try this place! Well, I went for brunch and certainly didn't have any pickles BUT the brunch truly changed my life. It really just was insane how they got the flavors to be just SO perfect! comfort food at its finest.

I had a hard time picking what entree I wanted to go with off of the menu but ended up picking the Sausage Gravy Smothered Chicken with Home Fries instead of grits. It was DELICIOUS. Chicken was not dry at all, full of flavor, the gravy was PERFECT, sausage was yummy and the portion is huge. I definitely could not finish it all in one sitting and kudos to anyone that can.

My relative ordered the french toast and they enjoyed that a lot. I included a photo. I actually didn't try any because I was too busy soppin up the chicken and gravy ;)

Restaurant is a decent size, not sure about parking, it's the city! Just uber!

I docked off one star because the wait was actually a complete turn off. Almost waited 2 hours after being quoted 45 minutes for a part of 5. The hostess seemed very overwhelmed with the busy brunch crowd. I don't believe they take reservations so either get there early or be prepared for a wait! It's definitely worth the wait for sure.

Our server was great, efficient and quick!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I have mixed feelings about Jacob's Pickles.
Portions were absolutely massive so you can easily share a dish with 1-2 more people. Prices were reasonable for how large the portions were. Service was decent.
But the wait is always long and the atmosphere was just CHAOTIC. The tables are so close together that you're just squashed and can't move without bumping into the person sitting behind or next to you. Party music was blasting so loudly that it was difficult to hear what others were saying. I felt like I lost my voice after eating here. And that's not my ideal brunch atmosphere.
The food, however, was good! I got the Coop Platter (Three Fried Eggs, Sterling Bacon, House-Made Breakfast Sausage, Grits, Biscuit & Home Fries) all for only $17. The home fries were yummy! Overall a decent, traditional breakfast dish. But I loved the Hot Chicken Biscuit (Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Nashville Hot Sauce) even more - I'd recommend getting this if you like a kick!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I'm Jersey proud but I do feel like I was a southern belle in a past life. This place has some pretty legit southern-style dishes and none disappoint. Sure their pickles are great, but it's the food you want to concentrate on. I've gotten the pickle sampler (4 choices for $11) and honestly, it's just entirely too many mason jar-filled pickles for me. Skip on this and just try one for $5. In all honestly, they all taste the same--it's a very small difference between them all.

Alas, the food. Any of their chicken dishes are great. But I'm also biased because I'm a fried chicken feign/fanatic. I love their chicken but their buffalo Mac and Cheese is the best. I always have leftovers to take home and believe it or not, it's best the next day. The trick is to bake the chicken while microwaving the pasta. Ugh! I'm getting hungry now.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants

Jacob's Pickles,"The food is amazing and the portion is more than average. They don't take reservation, so only walk-ins. We came here on a cold Saturday at 11AM and waited for 30 minutes. By the time we left, the line was fairly long.

The only shortfall for this restaurant is that everyone is jammed in together. You might be sitting shoulder to shoulder to a stranger and hear every word of their conversation.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,Love JACOB'S PICKLES!! This was a much needed addition to the hood a few years back. The food is excellent and pretty unique for NYC. That fact along with excellent service and great drinks makes it a happening spot to go and tends to be on the busy side. Especially weekends. Come early and grab your real estate.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I used to not think pickles were a great addition to a burger. Turns out, I was just eating shit pickles. Dunno how they do it but their pickles have an acidity that cuts like a spicy knife that doesn't overpower the meat of the entree.

My first visit was to try their platters of fried chicken smothered in gravy, which they cutely described as ""sandwiches"". It's cute because they put a biscuit on the bottom and top and called it a sandwich. My ex-girlfriend once called cheating ""a healthy exploration""... cute, isn't it?

Anywho, as per protocol, any scientific study starts with a baseline. The baseline being their Honey and Pickles, and the comparatives being the other 6 variations under the ""Sandwich"" section-- because I pride myself in being a fatass. The palette they were trying to attempt was a combination of sweet and spicy. The meal falls short of heat but prevails in sweet. Sweet, like my ex before she let someone else in her mouth.

On my second visit, my friend decided to order the poutine out of pure lack of restraint to the word ""cheese"". I scoffed at his basicness but as soon as a mountain of cheese and fries slammed down onto our table by the Southern God (our waiter), he soon scoffed at me. Then he gave me those eyes that say ""you're mine tonight"". It was a night of pure terror. Much like my best friend, the size was impressive but lacked the bravado to back it up. For all intents and purposes, it was a mountain of fries, melted cheese, and some bacon here and there.

I had my hand at a few of the other ""sandwiches"". The ""chicken, bacon, egg, and cheese"" was as described... literally just a plate with chicken, bacon, eggs, and cheese. No shame in playing it safe, but no risk, no reward. The ""bbq smothered"" was smothered in a light bbq sauce. In a dish that's inherently heavy, I thank them for their mercy, but I play to win. The true winner of the game, Winner Winner Chicken Dinner was the ""Mushroom Gravy Smothered Chicken"". To no surprise, in true Southern fashion, the dish most likely to leave you with a medical bill was the tastiest. Fried chicken lathered in a gravy of the fried chicken of the plant kingdom (mushrooms).

This is the perfect place to let your date know the ""real"" you and your fried chicken obsession. And if she can't handle you at your worst, than she doesn't deserve fried chicken.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"It's close to Columbia university.
It's crowded yes but doesn't take that long to get seat. It's about 10mins at most.
Server is handsome. Owner is humble. If she is.
The food is amazing. Very nice Italian style food I think
I ask mushroom chicken gravy something  only cost 17. It's in Manhattan....
My boy and me were so satisfied.
Thanks guys",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,Absolutely amazing. Came here for brunch and I was not disappointed at all. The sausage gravy chicken sandwich was to die for.

Can't wait to go back.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"We discovered this place on a trip to NYC.  As a lifetime lover of pickles and southern food I knew I had to stop!  We started with their BLT Bloody Mary, some selections of pickles and split a Southern BLT Biscuit.  All were awesome!

When we ordered a selection of 4 pickles we thought it would be a plate of a few of each but they brought out a ""taster tray"" of four jars!  We tried the special sours, carrots, green beans and the beets.  They were all very good - the special sours weren't as sour as I expected but was still good.

The biscuit could have fed 3 people - two pieces of chicken, two fried green tomatoes, a large helping of Cole slaw all between a single biscuit!  So good!  It also came with a bowl of the best cheese grits I've ever had.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Great place! It's always packed to the brim which should speak for itself. I'm sure that annoys some people but we went on a Tuesday and still wound up to be comfortable. The portions are huge and worth the price (which is about average if you ask me, for many other dishes that are smaller elsewhere).

Everybody was super friendly, service was quick, and the drinks were very good. This place is great for groups and the playlist was also great! A definite recommend if you like southern food. I took almost my entire entree home after wolfing down the appetizers and it's still just as delicious :)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I literally could go into food coma mode after I devoured my food at Jacob's Pickles.

I'm from out of town and was visiting the city so I only had one shot at ordering the right dish here. The menu was amazing and everything really captivated me, especially the various gravy options.  Ultimately, I ordered the super popular sausage gravy smothered chicken biscuit.

My body fell into a state of relaxation and comfort after every bite. I didn't feel gross or groggy from the richness, which is typically how I would feel when diving into a dish that is both rich and creamy like this one.

My brother also ordered the pepper jack bbq chicken biscuit and my mom had poutine appetizer. The poutine order was massive! Imagine this small Asian lady devouring by herself this giant pile of fries that are squeeze onto this tiny cast iron skillet. (My Mom honestly sucks at ordering and is a picky eater so fries dishes are her easy way out of things. Boy was she in such a huge surprise when that dish came out)

I can only imagine this place being crazy on a weekend because we ate here on a weekday for lunch  and I was just as popping as time went by. Overall, it was an awesome experience here.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"One of my favorite favorite places on the UWS! I was so sad when they closed down for the fire (although it gave me a chance to eat at their sister restaurant - Maison Pickle) before, but now they are open for business!  

The food portions here are huge and include many biscuit options (you have to get the biscuits!) - biscuits with ""fixins"", biscuit sandwiches, french toast biscuits, etc. You can't really go wrong - but my recommendation is to share so you can be sure to get a few sides of pickles. Also, the hot chicken sandwich is NO JOKE, so beware of the spice.

This place is always very crowded on the weekends for brunch, so plan to come before 11 am or be prepared to have a 1.5 - 3 hour wait. Dinner time on the weekend also gets pretty busy.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,Online reservations only for parties of 6+ so be prepared to wait! On a Saturday at 12pm there was an hour wait.  I had heard raving reviews for this place but to me the food did not meet that expectation.  Ordered the blt biscuit - biscuit was good but chicken was mediocre.  The grits were overwhelmingly cheesy for my friends and I to enjoy.  A fun place to splurge with friends but the food itself isn't very impressive.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Love love LOVED Jacobs! I've been hearing about this place for years and it truly did not disappoint! I think I was full for the entire day after brunch here. Our table shared the pickled carrots which were the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. We each ordered a different dish and loved ALL of them. The omelette, classic fries chicken, sweet bread pudding and breakfast sandwich. I think we all left with leftovers and full bellies. The bloody Mary's are also delicious and the Irving farm coffee and the fun beer growlers!

Ambiance inside is rustic and cozy and service is superb! Highly highly recommend this spot. Can't wait to try the sister restaurant across the street next!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants

Pickled things are delicious and the burgers are juicy and full of flavor.  There is no clean way to eat the burgers so expect to get a little juice dribbling down on your fingers.  

The music selection brings you back to the early 2000s.  You can jam out to your millennial days while eating pickles!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Came in on a Monday night with a friend around 4:30pm. When we arrived, there were a bunch of groups already seated, yet we were able to be seated immediately. The tables are really close together that you have to squeeze by to sit on the booth side of some tables. If you're looking to have a romantic date night here, this may not be the place for you because it is loud and you can definitely hear the conversation of the table sitting next to you. We also came in at a time where they were transitioning from lunch to dinner so the lights quickly dimmed while we were looking at the menus. They eventually placed candles on each table, which set the mood of the restaurant. The restaurant got packed shortly after we were seated so come here for lunch if you're trying to avoid the wait.

Our server was friendly and gave awesome recommendations. We started out with a Jam Jar for her and a Spicy Brine Margarita for me. The margarita was great and not too spicy. I only wish that it had a salt rim. We also got the Fried Pickles appetizer to share. It came with about 6 pieces and was definitely enough for both of us to settle our hunger but still be hungry enough for our meals. She ordered the Honey Chicken and Pickles Southern Biscuit Sandwich and I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Caesar Salad. In my salad, there was an even amount of chicken and salad. The chicken was still warm and crunchy when it was served and the salad had the perfect amount of salad dressing. There was plenty of food still left to take home after.

Despite the minor inconveniences, I love everything about the drinks, food and staff here! I'll be back and I'd recommend this place to everyone!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Food was much better than expected. Scrambled eggs and cheddar I expected to be meh... average. They were AH MAY ZING! Brussel sprouts 100! Coffee!!!!! Aside from I wanted to snack off all the plates I saw being delivered to other tables.

Host/seating experience was not top notch but not terrible. Cocktails are pricey but pretty.

Would certainly visit again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,Food was great and management took care of us when they lost our reservation - sat within twenty mins. Atmosphere is really fun but loud and maybe not the best if you have younger kids/teens.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"my favorite fried chicken place. Great flavor, good chicken, not overly deep fried, and very consistent.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I should have looked at the food photos before going here.

Was craving some good Southern biscuits & ordered expecting a cherished style like drop biscuits or baking powder biscuits but what I got was not that at all. The biscuits here are of cornbread consistency but without the corn flavor, instead just an unremarkable flour taste comes through. The fact that the biscuits order comes with a generous variety of different jams, preserves & butters just doesn't make up for the flavor & texture issues of the main attraction.

Ordered the hush puppies as well, which looked appealing, as they featured a nicely browned, crunchy exterior with a soft corn & herb-flecked interior. However, the flavor was rather bland & did not pair well with the creamy dip accompaniment.

Service was very friendly, especially given that I went on a busy Fri night. The menu options are varied & interesting. But unfortunately the food I tried was a big let down.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Finally made my way to Jacobs Pickles after drooling over their chicken and pancake pictures on Instagram!!

We were a party of two on a Friday afternoon and the wait wasn't too bad.. around 35 minutes (and it was Good Friday).

Service was great!
Our server was very attentive! Explained the menu details in depth and was very helpful and accommodating.

FOOD!
To start we ordered :

The classic Mac & cheese- This was so good!
The layer of cheese on top was perfectly browned and crispy!!
And the macaroni oozed cheese when bitten into!
Definitely recommend!

Biscuits & Fix Ins- These biscuits were delicious!!! They had Oreo biscuits as a special that day and I was able to sub one buttermilk biscuit for an Oreo one so I could try both!
These came with strawberry preserves (GOOD!!!!), orange preserves, honey, salted butter, and
maple butter (MY FAV!).
All of the fix-ins were delicious! But the maple butter was the GOAT! As they say now a days. Lol.

As our entrees we had:
Chicken & Pancakes- Ok.. I have a pretty big appetite.. so when I tell you that this plate was HUGE, do not take it lightly !!
You're served two ridiculously large buttermilk pancakes drizzled with honey, and if that's not enough, they plop on two ridiculously large pieces of buttermilk fried chicken with bacon bits.
I've come to the realization that I'm not the biggest fried chicken fan (I do like it but it's not my first choice) but the chicken here was pretty tasty! And the bacon was a nice touch ! (Bacon can do NO wrong!)
The pancakes were ok.. but I did get a little bored of them about half way through the first pancake.
I did take half of my entree home and have it for breakfast two days later and it tasted really good! So I don't know if I was too full from the appetizers to fully appreciate it at the restaurant but it was better to me two days later. Lol.

Chicken bacon egg & cheese biscuit ""sandwich""- This is not.. I repeat... Is NOT a sandwich!!!
Once again, the portion is HUMONGOUS!
The piece of chicken on this is huge.. so huge that there is literally no way that you can pick it up and eat it the way a sandwich should be eaten (which probably takes away from it).
We literally had to eat probably more than half of the chicken to finally find the biscuit hidden underneath it, but by that time it had already become too mushy from the egg yolk and sauce, so we still weren't able to pick it up.
We had to eat the sandwich with a fork.
Again, it was pretty good, but I wish I would've been able to enjoy it as a sandwich because their biscuit is pretty bomb!!
This also came with a side of cheesy grits which I enjoyed! But I don't really have anything else to compare it to because it was my first time trying grits.
................

Since they had Oreo biscuits as their special that day, they also had Oreo biscuit French toast...
which is what I REALLY wanted my friend to get (since we were splitting everything we ordered)
But he went with the chicken sandwich, and although it killed me inside, I couldn't force him to get the French toast.
Just thinking about it gets me angry all over again because those biscuits were soooo good that I could only imagine what they would taste like covered in eggy cinnamon wash and fried!
I definitely want to go back to try it soon!!

So overall, it was a pretty good experience!
Their apps were delish! Definitely wanna try another version of their Mac & cheese next time along with their French toast! (Hopefully they'll have the Oreo biscuits again!)
See you soooooon!! ; )",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Dripping with cheese and pickles, yes please! My husband and I wanted to find the best Bloody Mary and brunch and we found it! We both had the bloody BLT and it did not disappoint! The creaminess with the egg, acid from the pickle and the fattiness of the bacon paired well with the spiciness is the Bloody Mary. We both had the croque madame. The biscuits were so big! Fried chicken, ham, bechamel and cheese were tucked between two large cheese biscuits. You could have rolled me out of here! The food is amazing! Diets do not exist here! Sharing a meal is a safe bet! Food was amazing and so was the service!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Swung in on a cold Sunday night with a short line out the door at 6. Upon checking in, we were given a 15-20 estimated wait, but it was more like 10-12 minutes.

The space was dark, loud and fun. Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable on what to get and what's most popular.

As for the food:
We first ordered the fried pickles - it's in the name, we had to get it!
As for our meal, we split the Mac and cheese, and the shrimp and grits (bacon on the side for my pescatarian friend), and a seasonal pumpkin biscuit.

The pickles were light, and breading not too thick. It was amazing and I'm not even that big of a pickle fan!

The shrimp and grits had great flavor. The grits we're super smooth, creamy, and buttery. 5 shrimps came with and all were good sized and had great flavor. Mac and cheese we're ooey and gooey. The top was crunchy and crispy... Not healthy in any way lol but so necessary for your dinner! Finally the seasonal pumpkin biscuit. Flavors were good, but I wished it was warmed so the apple cinnamon butter would've melted on it. Being cold made it just okay.

For drinks we ordered the Kentucky Porch Sipper and the Autumn Blush. Blush was too sweet and didn't taste like  there was any alcohol in it... but that could've been from the sweetness...but sipper was nice. Our server said it was very popular.

Only negative is that it was freezing inside. We sat closer to the front and they wouldn't shut the doors (2 doors) so the strong wind kept blowing in. It would've been nice to take our jackets off... Or not hold our hands over the small candle trying to warm up. Like, I thought we'd warm up from the food or drinks but even that didn't help.

Either way, the food was still phenomenal. Guess I'll have to go back on warmer weather.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Coming from Singapore, I have no clue what's a good biscuit - the closest we get to a 'southern' biscuit are the ones from Popeye's (which is pretty shit tbh), but Jacob's Pickle finally schooled me on what a good biscuit entails.

The fried chicken was chicken breast, which made it a tad dry and less flavorful. Would've preferred it if it were chicken thigh with bone in! I also had the blueberry lemon biscuit and that little baby was so soft and fluffy - it simply melts in yo mouth!

Also, the pickles.. God, i love pickles. Their home made pickles really helped cut the greasiness of the fried chicken and grits while still maintaining the crunch.

The portion is huge! Could not finish this by myself but will definitely come back again to stuff my face.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"This is the alt left option for the alt right avocado toast crowd, dressing on the side. Wait. What?

It's up there in price and the wait can be long, obvi.

Do not get the ribs, unless you don't mind them boiled and finished in the oven slathered with sauce. That's what it tasted like to me.

The fried chicken was, ok. I live for fried chicken, but I'm not a snob about it( I've eaten the one's in vending machines and at rest stop 7-11's). It's better than average, but sometimes, I get sticker shock when I see what restaurants charge us for something I cook regularly (and better) at home.  

The chicken here is more bland than my ex from college who was a descendent of the Mayflower. That said, like sex, I rarely turn fried chicken down when given to me as an option. No matter how skeptical it looks from a table away, or how many times I've already had it, and didn't care for it. That's how much I love fried chicken and how much hope I have for humanity.

Their sides are actually better than any mains I've had, so far. If you just got apps and sides, it would be a better experience than the fried chicken and ribs. Besides, isn't that how every dining experience should be: a bite of these, little bit of that, and dip of a this. Walk away from the herd and experience life on the wild side, Gina.

The cocktails are on point and this is not debatable. Neither is the service, although the awkward POS device [from an iPad(?)] servers hand you at the end is so big every table from the restaurant across the street knows how much of a tip you just left.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I loooooovvvvveee this place!! I tell everyone about it and I bring all my close friends and family here when there visiting. The food is always flavorful and plenty. Seriously I think it's my favorite restaurant in NYC 100%  I've had a few different menu items but my favorites are the meatloaf, buffalo Mac and cheese and the pickled carrots and green beans!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"I honestly thought Jacob's Pickles was a bit overhyped and overrated. Came here for breakfast one morning right when they opened. No wait at that hour, which was nice. We ordered hush puppies to start, followed by breakfast entrees. Our food took FOREVER, and our server ended up comping the hush puppies, which was nice.

I had their take on a croque madame, which was generally good but SO rich and heavy that I can't imagine a single human being could finish it (I bet there are many, but not this girl, and definitely not as the first meal of the day--lesson learned). My mom thought the biscuits and mushroom gravy were pretty meh. The chicken and waffles were good though.

This is certainly not the best southern-inspired food I've had. I wouldn't wait in a long line to eat here. I'm glad I tried it especially since I was staying in the neighborhood, but wouldn't go out of my way to come back in the future.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"The food...so much food and so delicious. I am fan of their burgers, Mac and cheese , ribs and of course the fried Oreos.  I think it's a great first date place, reasonable prices but their food is worth every penny so no matter how the date ends you will be left satisfied.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"WHEN I SAY THIS PLACE IS GOOD, I MEAN ITS GOOOOOOOOOOD.

Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a go. Me and 4 friends were seated as soon as we got there. From start to finish everyone was so nice!!!!! I was almost confused bc in NY not every restaurant has this many attentive and happy staff.

Jack was our server and he was amazing. He really had the best recommendations and always kept our water glasses full & drinks full as well.

The FOOD!??? Omgggggg you're getting what you pay for here. The plate was bigger than my face and I couldn't even finish everything. It was so good!!!

Overall Had an amazing experience. I would go back and recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice good lunch in NYC.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"Love Jacob's Pickles! I visited Jacob's Pickles around 7 pm on a Saturday. The restaurant was very busy - there was an hour wait but we went to a nearby bar to pass the time. When we arrived to claim our table after receiving the text, the host was a bit rude and claimed we did not return in the 5 minute interval when I had a text timestamp showing we did. That was my only qualm with my experience.

Service was overall good. We did not wait long to place our order or for our food. We got the fried pickles, the mac and cheese, the hot chicken sandwich, and the honey chicken and pickles. Everything was delicious! The fried pickles were crunchy and flavorful. The Mac and Cheese was cheesy, creamy, but not overwhelmingly so. The sandwiches are delicious but HUGE. We wished we had only gotten 1 between two people because they were so big.

Overall, I would highly recommend - be sure to get a reservation in advance because there will be a wait!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles,"If you want some comfort food, or need to fill your stomach after a night of drinking, this is the place to be. I definitely recommend visiting this place at least once when you are in the city. The portions are very large, and the food is super savory. If you like cheese and you order a dish with cheese, they will dump mountains on your dish. Everything is so savory. The biscuits are extremely soft and crumble perfectly in your mouth without being too dry. They have interesting jams, maple butter, and the meltiest delicious regular butter you can add to your biscuits. If you are on a diet, this is not the place to be. For my order of ham egg and cheese biscuit sandwich, the egg was perfectly runny to my taste.

Be warned it is an extremely loud and crowded place. The music is very dancy, even at lunchtime and people are sitting very close to you having conversations and bumping into you left and right. My group of four had to share a table with a group of two. The wait time is the worst part. The earlier you get there the shorter the wait time should be. We got there around 11-11:10 and waited about an hour. Overall very good food and worth the wait, next time I visit I plan to try the drinks when I'm not hungover.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-new-york?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Made our way to Fairway and Hometown BBQ today.  Talk about killing two birds with one stone.  Absolutely fantastic.  If there is a better BBQ joint in NYC, somebody kindly let me know.

I've been to this location many times in person and despite a sometimes long wait the food is always worth it and they have delicious drinks to help you get through the line. Pastrami bacon, beef rib, brisket, greens are a must but you truly can't go wrong. Best bbq in NYC.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I've had lots of bbq in my time. I've had bad bbq and even mediocre bbq. This is by far some of the worst bbq I've had. It's pretty hard to mess up bbq brisket but the brisket i had was bone dry, completely devoid of flavor and had zero Smokiness. At $16/ 1/2lb i expected something that I'd devour. The bark didn't have flavor, the pieces i had were so dry they needed bbq sauce to swallow.

Mac and cheese was aldente.  Which in an italian establishment would be acceptable but in Mac and cheese I expect it to be incorporated well. This Mac was flavorless as well and was all show and no go.

The Korean style ribs were fried till they were crispy dry. No juice other than the sweet sauce they were covered in. These were edible but again at the price of $13.00 made me flinch at how bad they were.

All in all it was an extremely disappointing trip. No one ever has bbq leftovers. Mine are in the pictures",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"A few friends have recommended this place to me and I made it my business to get here and I was so underwhelmed with the food. My partner and I ordered the 1/2 pound of brisket, the Korean sticky ribs, and the slaw.

The brisket was tender and juicy but had NO FLAVOR. It was extremely bland! I had to put a ton of bbq sauce on it to make it tasty or taste like anything for that matter.

The Korean sticky wings were tasty. The sauce had a nice kick to it. My partner and I agreed that we should have ordered a rack of the ribs instead of getting the brisket.

I'm not sure if I will patronize these place again. It did not live up to the hype in my opinion",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Finding any BBQ that's even remotely close to what you'll get in Texas and other parts of the South is, well, not possible. I've heard about Hometown for what felt like years before giving it a try. They've been regarded to having the best BBQ in NYC, so I'd thought I'd give them a shot via Seamless Covid-19 delivery.

1 pound of brisket and sides of mac and cheese, pinto beans, and collard greens came out to $70 after tax and delivery fees.

Brisket - Average tenderness, somewhat dry.
Mac & Cheese - Bland!
Pinto Beans - Excellent!
Collard Greens - Also excellent.

Overall, don't expect the BBQ here to remind you of the great stuff in Texas.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"This was excellent -- the best barbecue I've had in New York, although not at the same level as my favorite places elsewhere. First visit, we came with a group of four and got a beef rib, 1.5 pounds of brisket, three strips of pastrami bacon, and lots of sides: corn bread, mac & cheese, beans, pickles, and slaw. My single favorite item was the beef rib, which I thought was really amazing, although I really liked the other meats as well. Among the sides, the mac & cheese was our favorite, and I'd definitely get the beans again. The rest of the group really enjoyed the slaw, pickles, and corn bread as well, although I was more take/leave on those.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

So glad they're open now,  came on a Saturday for lunch, beautiful and sunny, there's a table blocking the entrance, we were told to order on the website or the app, paid via cc, staffs are very friendly, they reassured that the actual waiting time is shorter than what's appearing on the website, which was 50 mins. I ordered my half pound brisket, took about 30 mins. No bathrooms available since they blocked at the entrance, we were informed to use bathroom at the Fairview across the block. The online ordering experience has been quick and pleasant.

The line was long, but being able to order a drink at the bar while waiting in line was really nice.  I was with 3 friends, and together we got a wide variety of everything - and nothing disappointed us.  I really don't think of NYC when it comes to barbecue... but maybe I need to start!  My boyfriend is a huge barbecue fan, and we always talk about going to the Carolinas for a barbecue trip... but I think I need to bring him here too!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Made spur of the moment plans for lunch with friends at Hometown Barbeque. We aimed for the noon opening time, arriving ten minutes early to find a queue of people already waiting. Shortly after, the doors opened, and we stepped inside.

Seeking variety, we ordered a few meats and several sides. Too early to start drinking, I opted for a cup of water from one of the coolers dispersed around the interior.

Let's start with the brisket: sublime. Tender meat that fell apart with the prodding of a fork. I had to pinch myself to be sure I wasn't dreaming. Fine on its own or with sauce.

The pulled pork was also excellent. I added some to the queso mac and cheese, which brought it over the top. You gotta try that combination. I could see myself eating this pork on a sandwich for sure.

The pastrami bacon was a fantastic and novel treat, a tasty sideshow, though not intended as a main act. The remaining sides were collard greens, potato salad, and cornbread. For a minute I was worried we had overdone it, but we just barely polished it off.

Hands down the best barbeque I've had in Brooklyn. Getting there early is a smart move. Perfect for dates, special occasions, and gatherings of friends and family.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Let me start off by saying the sides are absolutely ASS. Do not get the potato salad (is MASHED and not chunky) or mac n cheese (kraft tastes way better). The pickles are just regular pickles. Beans seem popular since they sold out when we got there.

As for the meat, the brisket was smoked nicely (great burnt ends) but a little bland. You had to dip it in sauce to enjoy it. The pulled pork was more like a stew and lacked smokiness. A huge let down for someone who loves traditional bbq pulled pork.

The best of my meal was surprisingly the WINGS. They were hot, sticky, and moist, with a generous topping of scallion, and the cilantro ranch that it came with was the best ranch ever.

After hearing all the rave about this place I'm underwhelmed, but would still return to try the lamb belly banh mi. Maybe they should consider adding more viet flavors to the sides lol",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

There were two medium ribs and the third one was no meat hardly at all. They were cold And dry. The cornbread was good. The potato salad was spicy which was not in the description and also it was like mashed potatoes there was an individual potato in there. Last time order from them.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I can confidently say that this is the best BBQ in the tri-state area.
It's not Texas level, but (narrowly) beats flying to Texas just for BBQ

We came on a Friday lunch. Took us a while to find street parking, as most of the close areas do not allow parking on Fridays around noon. But we were still able to get to the restaurant by 11:45. We'd planned on arriving early to avoid the line, but there was just 2 group of people in front of us. I'd say that you can arrive any time... even when we left before, the line wasn't bad at all.

Ordered a few things:
-brisket: this was really good... very tender. I do wish the bark was a bit more flavorful though (could do with a bit more seasoning), and also would be better if they gave you the choice between cut from point or flat (would've liked a fattier piece from the point)
-jerk ribs: this was a disappointment... they overcooked the ribs! They were a little burnt, and therefore not moist, nor fall-of-the-bone. I did love the flavor though (strong herb taste), so will give this another shot. In fact, I did buy another rack to take home, and found that to be much better
-lamb belly: this was my first time having lamb belly. This had a strong gamey lamb flavor, so as a huge lamb-fan, I loved this. I can see this being too strong though for people who do not LOVE lamb. This dish alone increased the rating by at least a star

Sides:
-beans/burnt ends were awesome. Had a strong smokey bbq-y flavor, maybe from the burnt ends?
-mash potato: wasn't the biggest fan of the flavor. Wouldn't order this again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Here are the BBQ dishes we tried:
- Brisket: Must have!! It was moist, juicy, and delicious (i didn't even need the sauce).
- Vietnamese hot wings: spicy and well cooked...meat was very tender and well marinated.
- Korean sticky ribs: It was tasty but I didn't go for a 2nd!
- Bacon: my least favorite of all..it was a bit dry and nothing really special. But the hubby liked it.

Sides:
- Potato: meh...
- Cold slaws: average

I wish they would add more vegetable side dishes or have a creamy corn side dish!

As for the drinks, they have a decent beer selection! If you are in a mood for a cocktail, take a look at pear margarita or the bloody mary (comes with bacon on weekends!)

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Very excellent barbecue that is well worth the wait! I went to Hometown Barbecue around 1:30 pm on a Saturday. The line was long and wrapped around the entire restaurant. We waited a little over an hour in total. However, it takes so long because they are custom cutting each person's meat as they order.

We got the brisket, spare ribs, mac and cheese, chicken, and baked beans. The brisket and baked beans were the best I've had in my life. All of the meat was extremely juicy - not a hint of dryness. The Mac and Cheese was very creamy and tasty.

Overall excellent experience - I would definitely trek back to Red Hook and wait an hour in line again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Hometown Bar-b-que is one of the most hyped places to eat in New York right now. Anf the one thing the place lives up to is the line - I waited a whole 2 hours to get my meat.

Agreed it was Saturday, lunch time. And I got there a little past 1pm - peak time.

One of my favourite pastimes is to observe people. And On the bright side I had plenty of time to do that

- the extended family of 8 that over-ordered and was arguing about who to blame
- the 2 girlfriends that decided the line was too long after waiting in front of me for 15 minutes. But not before taking 7 selfies in various poses in front of someone else's table.
- the father reassuring his daughter sitting next to me at the bar that the amazing guy she went on a date with will call her back.

Now to the food. It was good. I liked all the things I ordered - the brisket, the beef rib and the sausage. But the meat was not particularly warm and after approximately 4 minutes parts of it were cold. Everything was soft and tasty though.

I guess the lasting memory of this spot for me is the line. Unfortunately the food was not good enough to wipe out the annoyance of having to wait that long.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Superb, Superb & Superb! If your a meat lover & enjoy BBQ, you'll enjoy the food here & the line that seems to be the obstacle in getting good ribs and brisket in your belly. The long lines & bumps of not always getting what you want and being sold out. Makes you come back again to take on the challenge again! Good drink (more locally brewed options would be great!). You need to try their briskets, sandwiches & tacos.. their potato salad is great too! I have noticed wanting to just pop by as I past by often more and more now!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"The BEST BBQ I've had so far in my life. On Sunday at 8pm there was a pretty long line. We waited 45 minutes and by the time we got to order, half the things on the menu were sold out. So come early!!

We tried the beef brisket and spare ribs. Both were insanely good. No sauce needed. The brisket was seasoned generously with black pepper. It was not dry at all and melt in your mouth delicious. The spare ribs were also very flavorful, smokey and tender.

I cannot wait to return hungry to try the rest of the menu.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Waited 2 hours for cold food. woman in the front who i kept asking for updates on my order was oblivious and unhelpful, kept telling me to come back every 15-30 minutes. no doubt most of the food in my order was already prepared and sitting out while they completed my order veryyyyyy slowly. Chicken and brisket tacos were $10 each and what we received was a glop of meat in the middle of a soggy pita wrap. chicken taco also featured a lovely chicken neckbone that was found slightly too late... yum! sandwiches came out soggy, and ice cold. if you guys can't handle this coronavirus food delivery, then don't do it, complete waste of money! i expected much greater and now will definitely have to reconsidering ordering from what i used to call one of my favorite spots in the city.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

The food itself is super good, special props to the pastrami bacon and some of the best mac and cheese I've had in a while. $120 for 4 people (got some brisket, pulled pork, wings, sticky ribs, bacon, mac and cheese, cole slaw, a slice of cornbread and two small banana pudding).",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Omg, talk about game changing BBQ!
I came on a Tuesday with the fam because I heard during the weekends this place is packed. It was fairly quiet, but there were still a lot of people coming, and as it got later there were actually items selling out!
We got a bit of everything: beef rib, pulled pork, brisket, and sausage. Sides were beans with burnt ends, collard greens with bacon, cole slaw, and corn bread. Oh boy, there was not one thing on that plate we didn't like! Everything was so well cooked and flavorful. My personal fav was that beef rib, I higgggghly recommend!!!!!
There is also a bar in the same area so we got some cocktails and beers that perfectly paired with our meal.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I have been following Bill Durney, the owner of Hometown BBQ for years. He comes to Texas often to learn from the best Texas pitmasters, and goes back to Brooklyn and puts his own twist on Texas BBQ. When I was recently in Brooklyn for a few days, there was no doubt that I was going to hit up Hometown BBQ.

After a short Uber ride I was ecstatic to smell the intoxicating smell of good BBQ, knowing I was about to have a great experience. It was so hard to narrow down what all I was going to order. I had to get at least one of his special creations like sticky Asian pork ribs, or lamb Bahn MI. I decided on the Bahn MI, a slice of moist brisket and burnt ends. My wife got a brisket sandwich and queso Mac and cheese.

Let me say, that lamb belly Bahn MI with spicy BBQ sauce is ridiculous! I'm not a BBQ sauce guy, but this sauce is sooo good. Old leather would be good with this sauce on it. Don't let that take anything away from sandwich.  The brisket rivals the best brisket Texas house. Queso Mac and cheese, let that sink in for a minute. Yes, it tastes as good as it sounds.

I am a BBQ snob from Texas and I would tell anyone to hit up Hometown. It's legit!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"During the corona virus lock down they are open for pickup with advance order.

If this were any other time they would receive great marks for their bbq, but if you're interested go elsewhere for the time being. Why? Half (50%) of our brisket was fat .. pure slabs of fat. So we paid for half of what we could not eat nor digest and of course you don't know this until you arrive home with the order.

The ribs were okay. Not as good as they have been. I don't know, do they have another pit master or carver?

My suggestion is stay clear or go elsewhere until you can dine in house so you can complain to management on the spot if the food sucks as it did for us.

Bon appetite ~",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"The first photo is what I received today. The majority of the brisket is all fat! I probably had came to hometown bbq about 40 times..but recently I came 3 times during the corona because I am absolutely inlove with their brisket. (As it is never fatty and just pure amazing delicious meat) however this was gross....-_- last week I came and it was fatty as well I had my boyfriend tell the guy to switch it because it was clearly inedible..he had no problem switching it and brought back better meat. Today I checked my meat before leaving and the same guy from last week told me that brisket is usually fatty and that's just the cut of meat...as if I don't come here as my daily ritual. Whatever. You lost a brisket loving customer.i also added a picture of how brisket is supposed to be, since your a brisket professional...",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"If I could sum up Hometown BBQ in 2 words it is... Grossly overrated. I am not saying the bbq is bad but for all the tv shows, reviews, and hype it is wayy overrated.  I was waiting the whole meal for that wow moment that happens at big time places. It simply didn't come.

I ordered a little of everything too. The brisket was good not great. The korean ribs looked better on tv than they tasted. The flavors didnt pop they were kind of muted.  The pulled pork sandwich was solid but again everything sort of tasted the same in the sandwich even though it had a bunch of ingredients.  The bbq beans side was the worst thing we had. The two things that were above average was the sliced turkey and the cornbread. Those 2 were very good. The bbq sauces also had good flavor and a little kick to them. They have a few different kinds.

Just an fyi on the line... there wouldn't be a line if there were more than 3 employees working. It isn't busy in there it just isn't efficient.  The long wait has nothing to do with the food.  It makes the place seem cooler than it is so I guess it is smart marketing Ha.

I would not recommend waiting on line 1 hour for this.  There is no chance I wait that long again. Once the novelty wears off you realize the hype isnt real.  No way this is the best bbq in the country let alone Brooklyn.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Food: Brisket sandwich was amazing! so so good! I want some more right now! The mac and cheese was just okay. Collard greens just okay. I would skip sides all together next time!

Drink: got a glass of wine while waiting- pretty standard. They have a bar that you can grab something while you wait on the VERY long line.

Service: You order at the register. They assemble your food after you order (this is why everything takes so long- but I think its worth it). You then take your tray and find a table to eat at.

Atmosphere: we got there right before it opened and the line was to the corner already.  The line pretty much wrapped around the building the entire time we were there. It was SOO hot inside on the line. Pretty uncomfortable. Tables are pretty jam packed. Ended up sitting with another party at a long table once we got our food. Warehouse kind of a feel- very Brooklyn lol.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Went here with a friend to check out the best BBQ in NYC. After braving the 90 minutes line, we were finally able to indulge in this great BBQ feast.

We tried the brisket and sausage and lamb and corn bread and coleslaw. The brisket and lamb were decent--not the best I've ever had, but definitely above average. I would say that the coleslaw was also on that level.

The sausage was a little more memorable for me and the corn bread was the best thing we ate.

Overall, not sure this place is worth the long wait, but I was glad to finally check out what all the fuss is about. Staff were very friendly and everything is reasonably priced--just be ready to wait a while.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I have seen Hometown BBQ on several top 50 BBQ joints in America lists and it was easily a no-brainer for me to be among my first stops visiting New York.  I left speechless and for the first time ever, I posted my status with just emojis on Facebook.

As I was waiting outside for Hometown to open, I saw a man walking his dog.  I asked him if they had good BBQ inside and it turned out to be the owner haha.  He made it a point to call me by my name and called I am guessing his assistant manager out to meet me.  He then told her that the area in front of the door needed to be cleaned of the cigarette butts and a little trash.  Just from my point of view, beside a cup, there wasn't any trash I really noticed.  But that told me that he took serious pride in his restaurant by making sure even the New York City street outside was spotless.

You go up to the counter to order.  I was the lucky one to be first in line.  The line does tend to get long but that is because there is one butcher taking time with every customer one on one.  A note I need to add is that you order drinks at the bar.  But there is a orange cooler just for water if you do not want a drink.  The bartender did make me a decent sweet tea but charged me $4 for it. I didn't ask about free refills but I am guessing since I am not in the South where the sweet tea runs plentifully, that would have been a big negative.

My entree was 1/4 pound pork, 1/4 pound brisket, 2 ribs, queso mac and cheese, potato salad, and cornbread.  All the meat was phenomenal but if I had to choose one, it would be the brisket.  It was everything that a brisket should be - tender, juicy, went well with the sauce, marbled, and an easy to chew black pepper/other spices rub.  The ribs were fall off the bone with the same rub as the brisket.  The pulled pork was juicy, tender, and wet.  But it was not mixed with the BBQ sauce on the table.  It seemed like it was it's own au jus!  I didn't know pork had au jus haha

The queso mac and cheese was exactly what you expect with a mild to medium queso that melted in your mouth.  The potato salad was by far, maybe the most unique I have ever had.  The best way I can describe it is to take red mashed potatoes and mix dill and horseradish in it.  I liked it but after a while, it was too much for me.  The butcher gave me a piece of cornbread for free.  I don't know if he does this for everyone or just because I told him I came all the way from Alabama to try Hometown.  But the cornbread was light and sweet.

There are 2 sauces - sticky and hot and sweet.  I liked the sticky the best.  It was definitely a Texas-inspired sauce with a hint of sweetness due to molasses or honey in it but with tangy, bold flavor.  It was phenomenal with it all especially the brisket. The Hot and Sweet was like a hot sauce like a thicker Crystal with a taste of sweetness at the end.  On a heat scale of 1 to 10, I would put it at a 5.  The heat does not last long.

Be prepared to dish out some money here if you are going to eat like me.  The meat is weighed and all the small sides are $5.  It is just like a Texas BBQ joint.  But the portions are huge.  For my meal, I dropped $50, but I would do it again because this was absolutely phenomenal. Out of the approximately 500 BBQ joints I have ate at in my life, Hometown is a strong case for #1.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"This place speaks for itself.  It has a reputation.  My first time here.  My friend, not so much.  You enter to a massive space.  Get on line to the left, to the left.  Peruse the wall menu.  Make crucial decisions. Drink before or after. Who wants to drink with such heavy proteins, I say?!  Their drinks are a rip off, btw.

We ordered brisket, Korean ribs, burnt ends, pastrami bacon, along with a side of the baked beans with burnt ends and their cole slaw.  Everything was absolutely divine, especially the ribs coating.  Only thing, I freaking love love love pastrami.  That being said, this is the first time I tried pastrami bacon.  It was disappointing to express the least.  Way too much fat and so f'in uncontrollably greasy from all the excess fat.  How are you supposed to enjoy a bacon variation of pastrami with so much unnecessary globs of unrendered fat?

To much dismay, I had no choice but to quickly recover and enjoy the rest of our bounty.  Wow!  Wowzers! Once you place your order in the line, they'll give you a number placard, grab any table you like and they'll bring you your meat!

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"These people care deeply about their customers, but it manifests itself in how delicious the food is. They don't make it easy on their customers at all. The ordering process sucks. The app sucks. The shitty one napkin sucks. The inability to say ""no pickles"" sucks. The commute sucks. The process by which you pick up the food sucks. The barbecue is the best I've ever had in my life.

When you had lines down the block, you could waste an hour of a hipster's time by telling them they were special because they waited in a line. You could do this because your care and devotion to craft meant that demand would always outstrip supply. Holy fuck. The barbecue. The barbecue. The ribs and pulled pork. It is magical, and it is because you love the people who eat there.

Now, I want you to love the people who eat there by: not using a shitty app, allowing people to say no pickles, maybe allow people to pay $20-25 for tossing in a side and a bottle of water in some kind of combo deal rather than an additional $8, maybe offer a $50 takeout special for two. Maybe make it so that you can look people's orders up by their names because no one knows what their damn toast confirmation number is, because Toast sends it in a delayed email, and doesn't display it after you order. Maybe include more than one shitty 1-ply napkin. Maybe call people's name out when the food is ready. Maybe add a trash can where people can toss their food after eating on a bench. Maybe allow people a ""no pickles"" option.

You love the customers enough to serve them the best barbecue and ribs of their life, and to do the process right. It's painstaking, and you put in the work. But customers in NYC are merciless, and they don't want to work as hard as you do. Please, during this time, while your supply for the first time ever outstrips your demand, allow yourselves to make it easier on the customer to give you their money. It doesn't mean you aren't worth the pain, I promise. It's just that The Experience of waiting a long time for a sandwich isn't cute anymore, even if the sandwich itself is the most beautiful fucking thing I have ever seen in my life. It's the goddamn Langer's #19 of barbecue, and if you can put up with all the inconvenience it takes to get Hometown to sell you one, do it, because it's heaven. But I'll eat here five times a year instead of twenty because it's so much trouble. And I would really love to throw more money at a place so fucking devoted to making absolutely delicious and hedonistic perfection.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"It is a pretty good bbq place for NYC. However, the line for the food is so long. You can wait about 1 hour for food. The brisket is very moist and tender. The spare rib is a little dry and chewy. Mac and cheese is very good. The collard green is a little too salty. In term of pricing, it is pretty steep and they sell the meat per pound. The spicy sauce tastes very good. You can eat it together with the bbq. The place is full of bbq smoke. You will get out smell like bbq all over your hair, clothes, jeans, etc",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"A fun place to go with friends and family if you have the time! Really good barbecue for not being in the south. Me and one of my friends got the brisket sandwich with queso and another one of my friends got the pulled pork sandwich with queso. We all devoured our sandwiches. I got to try my friend's pulled pork sandwich and I definitely liked that sandwich better than the brisket one. It wasn't as dry and the coleslaw was a great touch. We also got the Mac n cheese, smoked pit beans, and banana pudding. All delicious. Walked out of the restaurant barely able to move from over eating.
Only downside is that the line is insanely long and you have to stand the whole time waiting. Took us an hour to get to the front. It was manageable because we got drinks to have while in line. By the time we got to the front, we were starving so it probably made the food taste that much better.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

I went with the beef brisket, beef ribs, corn bread, and mac & cheese.  Everything was exceptional... beef ribs are probably the best I've ever had with the bark coming in strong.

1 Corn bread is huge and tasteful, not too sweet or not too salty.  Just right.

My only knack on this place is the price.  Beef ribs charge by the pound but each bone is like almost a pound.  I ended up paying $150 for 1/2 lb beef brisket, 2 beef rib bones, 3 corn bread, and medium mac & cheese.  The 2 beef rib bones came to near 4 lbs.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"HOMETOWN BBQ is a New York institution. The food is amazing, Durney is a gem, and everything about this place has meaning.

We picked up food from Hometown last Sunday after ordering online. Their online ordering platform is great and the timing about when our food was ready (shows up after you place your order) was totally accurate. I actually called ahead of time to make sure that by ordering through their website, they got all the money without a cut going to any kind of third party service -- they assured me that it goes directly to them.

The pickup process was maybe the best and safest I have seen. You never go inside the restaurant.  You stand outside and yell your order number. Someone brings it out and puts in on a table in front of the restaurant and goes back inside. Safe for you and for them. Well done!

The brisket travels VERY well. We reheated it wrapped in foil in the oven and it was absolutely phenomenal. Wings were reheated in the microwave (though next time I may try the oven) and were also amazing.

Thanks for being so awesome hometown. We'll be coming back again for safe pickup and can't wait until we can sit at the bar and eat with you.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Better than any BBQ I've had anywhere, including Texas.

Off the beaten path in Red Hook, but it's worth the trek. Everything is delicious, but the beef rib takes the cake.

Right next door to Brooklyn Crab, hang there for the day and head over to Hometown when you're hungry. Fair warning, the line will be long. Very long. 2 hours long I've heard sometimes. The Hometown team does a great job keeping up with the demand by BBQing throughout the day, so getting what you want shouldn't be too big of an issue.

Big space inside with lots of seating. Best to go with a big group so you can sink your teeth into a variety of menu items while spreading out the cost.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"As a very biased Texan, I have to say that Hometown is my favorite BBQ in NYC so far. This is solely due to the brisket and the vibes inside.

Yes, the line is crazy long, but you can drink and there's sometimes music! Solid beer selection and honestly waiting a bit in a warehouse striking up random convos with your line neighbors feels very right before BBQ to me. But if you can't do the wait, definitely go elsewhere.

The brisket was great! Moist, slightly fatty, decent amount of bark. The ribs were nice as well - not incredibly flavorful but that's what sauce is for. The cornbread was fresh and a great complement to the meat. The sides were disappointing. Mac and cheese was watery and the potato salad was way too sour and in mashed form, reminded me of baby food.

For sure, sides aren't the most crucial part of a BBQ experience but they're certainly an important part. I missed having access to sliced bread, pickles, jalapenos, a wider range of sauce options, especially hot sauce. But you know what, for that brisket, definitely worth coming back.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"What a solid BBQ joint!

My friends and I came on Sunday night around 6pm and the wait was already an hour long. They are a counter service BBQ hall where you order first then find seating. They have ample seating space and we had no problem finding a table for the 6 of us after we placed our order. It's also first come first serve in terms of food items on the menu because they tend to sell out of certain items.

We came as a group of 6 and got the following to share:
Korean Spicy Wings (3 for $12) and Vietnamese Hot Wings (3 for $10): If you're looking for something that's packed with spice then this will not disappoint! The meat was juicy and it was so flavorful combined with the sauce.

Brisket ($14 for 1/2 pound), Pulled Pork ($14 for 1/2 pound), Lamb Belly ($14 for 1/2 pound), Jamaican Jerk Baby Back Ribs ($33 per rack), and Thick Slab Pastrami Bacon ($14 for 1/2 pound). Everything was tasty but I must say my favorites would be the Jamaican Jerk Baby Back Ribs and the Pastrami Bacon. There's definitely a kick to the ribs and the bacon was the perfect amount of meat and fat.

They have a selection of sides and it comes in either small, medium or large. My group opted for the Texas Style Mac and Cheese, Collared Greens, Smoked Pit Beans, Whiskey Sour Pickles, and Corn Bread ($5 per slice). My personal favorites would be the Texas Style Mac and Cheese, Whiskey Sour Pickles, and the Corn Bread. $5 for Corn Bread seems a little outrageous but this was totally worth it. The texture was dense and the bread wasn't too dry. There was also some kind of glaze on top which made it even more delicious.

They have takeout containers and boxes for any leftover food which is great because nothing goes to waste. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the food and would come back again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Hands down the best BBQ in NYC and it's not even close.  This is the only BBQ that can truly compete with the upper echelon in real BBQ towns.  

The leading meat here is the brisket and it's excellent.  The only place I've had better is Cattleack BBQ in Dallas.  It's deliciously moist with great flavor.  Not the dry nonsense most people not from Texas had as their introduction to Brisket.  Sometimes the cuts can be a bit overly fatty, but usually it's just the right amount to keep the meat moist and flavorful.  

It doesn't end with the brisket, though.  There are no misses here.  The pulled pork is excellent.  The ribs are very good.  There are also a few non-traditional BBQ cuts that you should absolutely try.  The lamb belly is fantastic and the Korean sticky ribs are so good.  

They don't miss on the sides either. The beans are among the best I've had.  Probably only topped by Bogart's in St. Louis.  The mac & cheese is delicious as well.  

Though it's a pain in the ass to get here, the atmosphere is great.  Nice bar too, which is a rarity at top BBQ joints.  There's often a long line and the ordering process is not the best, but the food more than makes up for it.  They're open all day so you can go at an off time and experience little to no wait.  And unless you go toward the end of the night, it's unlikely they'll be out of anything.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I'm a little late with this review but felt I had to write it because this place was such a MAJOR let down.  I was so excited based on the reviews. The odd thing is, it was packed.  I thought that was a good sign but MAN I was soooooooo wrong.  I went and ordered a lil of everything.  The place was like an indoor picnic.  Looked like a bunch of picnic tables and it just looked messy and you had to find your own seat.  I could not find seats for us to eat together so we ordered the food to go.

I will start by saying my family is from the south.  So I was really looking forward to trying the food BUT it was terrible!!!!!!

1.  Pastrami Bacon & Brisket - Very fatty and lacked flavor.
2.  Mac & Cheese - Awful!!!  They poured liquid cheese on top.
3.  Beans - They were not edible.  Somehow they were dry.
4.  Collard Greens - Crunchy/undercooked with lil flavor.
5.  Baby Ribs - Got some other type of ribs that I did not order and they were nothing to write home about.
6.  Pulled Pork - Was decent but not the best I've ever had.
7.  Wings - Were just ok.
8.  Banana Pudding & Cornbread - Were the best things of the whole dinner.

This was literally the worse BBQ I've ever had.  So many better options then this place.  The reviews really had me fooled.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I have mixed feelings about this place.

First, the inside is a bit ""smokey""...hey that comes with the territory and is what they do, but if that kind of stuff bothers you, or bothers your eyes, etc... then consider that.

Next, the food.  I've been here once before on a weekend, and it's crowded.  Again, sometimes I travel with people who don't want to wait.  That was a problem on my weekday, mid-day visit recently.

However, I just wasn't wild about my pulled pork sandwich.  With the slaw mixed in and the juices, I really couldn't taste the pork. (it tasted like butter to me)  It's almost too ""creamy"".  I'll get it just naked next time.   The other thing I was looking forward to was the potato salad.   This is more like ground up mashed potatoes that are cold, with a kick of spice.  Not what I was expecting and the consistency I just don't like.   I'd go with beans next time.

In general, I should probably be thankful to have my taste buds challenged from the norm, but I thought, if this is supposed to be ""comfort food"", it's not giving me any comfort.  That's just me.

Anyway, the staff is friendly and efficient, but overall, I'm going to need to re-visit before I'd recommend it to others.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I finally made my way here after having this spot on my list for like AGES. It's really inconvenient to get here in a way because it's so far away from manhattan, but that the same time it's super convenient because it's close to ikea.

Naturally, I took the ikea ferry to get here on a weekend. I probably got here like 12:15 or something like that, and there was already a HUGE line here. I think there were probably people lining up here before the store opened (it opens at 12 on the weekend), so I think even if you get there 5-10 minutes before the restaurant opens, you'll still have to wait another 15-20 minutes before you can order. At the very least, the food is mostly pre-prepared, so there isn't a wait time once you ordered.

We got brisket, cornbread, vietnamese wings, the house made sausage, baby back ribs, and a side of slaw (this was for two people. The total was probably about $60 something, and I feel like it was the right amount of food, since we both left full (i ate a small breakfast). The slaw was fairly normal, just your typical cole slaw, but everything else was great. I thought the standout items were the vietnamese wings, which are expensive but actually really large, and the cornbread, which is also expensive but worth it.

I totally want to come back, and will probably try to find some way to get here earlier next time.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"The food was good but I don't think it warranted a 1.5 hour wait at 4pm on  a weekend. It seems like they don't have enough people working behind the counter and that is what causes the wait. If they add 1 or 2 extra staff behind the counter to take orders and cut the meat, it would decrease the wait time a great deal. There is plenty of space behind the counter to add extra staff so I don't understand why they don't do it. There is an area with a moosehead in the middle of the restaurant and we started off our wait there. When asked, someone told us that spot means an hour wait. He was completely right as the line moved once every 5 minutes. The fatty brisket was good and I got the pulled pork sandwich which was good.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"My friend and I were feeling a hankering for some Bar-B-Que last Saturday and decided to head over here. Perhaps because it was one of the first really nice days of the year, Hometown Bar-B-Que was packed. We waited in line to order for nearly an hour even though we arrived at 2pm. I feel that the line is more due to the inefficiency of the restaurant staff than it is the number of people. They could implement some improvements to their ordering process which would speed up the line and turnover at their restaurant.

We ordered an assortment of dishes including the Korean ribs, brisket, pulled pork, spare ribs, cornbread, and pickles. The total was over 70 dollars which seemed a bit pricey for the amount of food. I wouldn't say this is life changing bbq but it certainly was good. Our favorite was the Korean ribs. I would be back if it wasn't so far out of the way and the wait wasn't so long.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Brisket, bloody marys, and Vietnamese hot wings. Yes, consume in that order and you'll be a happy camper.

This is my third time visiting and I cannot get enough of their brisket. Every bite was juicy and tender. Their sticky sauce did not disappoint, however; I did not care too much for their hot & sweet sauce. It had no zing to it. The Vietnamese hot wings were my second favorite main dish. Super flavorful and juicy! Washing down delicious BBQ with their spicy bacon bloody mary is a must!! I mean their bacon was dipped in maple. What more could you ask for??

As for how long you'd have to wait and drool as you watch people eat... I'd say about 45ish minutes. Seating is also hard to come by as customers love love love to save seats as they walk in while their friend stands in the back of the line. I think customers with food (also elders and babies of course) should only be allowed to save seats. Think about it... by the time customers finish eating, their friends (seat savers crowd) wouldn't even get their food or place their orders yet. That's one of the things I dislike. The other is their pulled pork. I'm just not a big fan of it's texture and taste. My friends enjoyed it though, but it wasn't for me. I'll stick to their brisket.

I'll definitely be back because that long line was worth it!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Hometown BBQ was awesome! I can see why the line gets so long. My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday ~1pm (prime time) and waited about an hour in line. It is nice that you have the option to get drinks at the bar while you wait in line.

The food was amazing!! I ordered a pulled pork sandwich (YUM!!) and my boyfriend ordered the Jamacian jerk ribs and the brisket. We got mac and cheese and cornbread as sides. We definitely over ordered but it was nice to try a few different things and we took the rest home. Seriously some of the best BBQ in the NYC area!

The ambiance is perfect for a BBQ spot! They have a bunch of tables and fun lights and decorations. If I am in the Red Hook area again I will definitely come back - just schedule more time to wait in line.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"There are a few awesome BBQ spots in NYC to save yourself a trip down South or to the Midwest in order to get some deelish Q! . Hometown  BBQ is one of them!  They have two spots in Brooklyn. One in Redhook and the other in Industry city. The one in Redhook has been around for about 6 years. The atmosphere is great, they have live music and a couple of bars. They even have tacos and sandwiches filled with their awesome smoked meats.

On this recent visit I had the
Brisket
Spare ribs
Lamb belly
Wood fried Chicken w Oaxacan marinade, pickled red onion and salsa verde
Whiskey sour pickles were on point.

The lamb belly was a first for me and it was really good! It looks like pulled pork, had and had nice crisp to it. Definitely will have it again!
The brisket could have been a little more moist. I've had it before here and its generally  really good.

The Spare ribs were perfectly cooked and really tasty.

This was the first time I had the wood fried chicken. It was good with that marinade and the salsa verde. I would  order this again.

They have also done a really good job in the neighborhood with walkways and jogging paths that provide sweeping  views of the Hudson.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Really hate to leave a poor review during these times. My negative review has nothing to with the quality of the food, I have been a long-time patron of this restaurant. However I recently had a very upsetting visit. I placed an order for 1 o'clock pick up and I had to wait there for an hour until my food was ready around 2. During that time there was an older man part of the managerial staff continually going in and out of the restaurant to unload supplies from his car without a mask or gloves on. He also would stop and talk to other customers (ignoring the 6' social distancing) about how this situation is ridiculous and overplayed, saying the virus was ""just a flu that's killing old poor people"".

Putting aside how upsetting this mans ignorance was, this behavior raises concerns about how sanitary the restaurant is in this time. After returning from picking up supplies somewhere in the city, he was immediately handling food and interacting with customers and delivery drivers without a mask or gloves. This behavior coupled with this kind of attitude seems like the perfect recipe for continuing the spread of the virus. I definitely will not be eating here during these times and will find it hard to come back and support this place long after all of this is over.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Hands down the best BBQ in New York. Brisket? Delicious. Korean wings? Flavorful. Sides? All delicious. But the real star? THE BEEF RIBS. One beef rib alone is at least a pound. While it may look burnt, do not let looks fool you. The second you approach that rib with a fork, it falls right apart. Super tender and what all of your fatty dreams are made of. Unfortunately for us, we have never been able to make it to dessert.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"This was some killer bbq. Be careful in the area though, like all of Brooklyn, parking blows and there are lots of rules about parking over here.

I did the sausage, ribs and brisket on a Friday at 12:30.  There was almost no place to sit already.  Everyone working there was super friendly. Walked right in and up to the meat counter, no line.

Sausage was spiced like a kielbasa, not at all what I would call an Italian sausage.  However, it well cased, super plump, and juicy.  Terrific.

The ribs were some of the best I've ever had, and I ate them all without any bbq sauce. Loved the rub, perfect cook, not too firm and not too soft. Really excellent. Only problem I had was they gave me an end piece that was a little over and slightly chewy.  That, combined with the lack of fat, made the rub a bit overpowering.

Brisket comes out, and it looks great. Black bark, when it's sliced I can see the glistening insides, exactly what I want to see. Unfortunately, the bark flavor was disappointing, and even though the meat was fatty and a great texture, it couldn't hold up on it's own and really needed sauce.  

Corn bread was 5$ for 1 piece, which pissed me off until I saw how big it was. Super tasty, the bottom part had like a maple something weighing it down.  Again, delicious.

I haven't had bbq this good in a long time. Big fan.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"As a NYC native and a super sucker for BBQ, I have sampled a ton of NYC BBQ establishments in my lifetime and none have impressed me more than Hometown Bar-B-Que (bear with me here, I've only been to the South one time and have only had BBQ at some roadside gas station rest stop).

My two favorite items on the menu would be their beef brisket and spare ribs. Their spare ribs is fall-off-the-bone tender and is remarkably well seasoned and marinated. It goes very well with the mac-and-cheese, which they lather into a cup (they come in three sizes). Beware -- it is incredibly filling and you may need less than you think. Their brisket always comes with the perfect lean and fat ratio. Whether you order it as a cut or in a sandwich, you will not regret it.

I have had their pulled pork and lamb belly as well -- both very well done. They go great with the restaurant's hot sauce and sticky BBQ sauce.

The only thing on the item that did not impress me was their sausage. Usually at BBQ joints I expect a snappy exterior and a firm bite, but the sausage here (at least the two times that I've ordered it) has a bit of a pasty texture. Still tasted great though, just not the same in terms of mouth feel. Their chicken is worth trying as well although definitely not as outstanding as the rest of their menu.

The staff has always been fantastic. I don't think I've ever felt any type of negativity from them. The tall lanky dude that typically takes the orders and slices up the meat is very cordial and friendly. Did not get his name the few times I was there, but he's fantastic!

There's also a bar at the front and the back of the place so lines to order drinks are never an issue! The line to order food can become quite long though, so prepare yourself. Weekends are exceptionally busy.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Absolutely delicious.  The portion sizes are enormous, so you really do get plenty of food for the price.

- brisket- a MUST get
- spare ribs- delicious and tender
- pastrami bacon- so fatty but SO DAMN GOOD
- Mac and cheese- nothing out of the ordinary, but still yummy especially with their BBQ sauce

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Great music and great cue!

Tender fall off the bone beef ribs, better then the brisket in my opinion. Perfect amount of fat and meat blended together waiting to be sucked off the bone. Briskest was pretty bomb too. The Vietnamese wings and the korean ribs were a little too sweet for our table. But I love the Asian influence in a BBQ menu and for that reason this place is a clear winner!!

And!!! All the sides were good Mac and cheese, cornbread, pickles and cole slaw. No beans because we had a long car ride back...

Although it gets busy the later you come, I recommend coming after 7:30 for the live Great music and great cue!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Went out with a group of friends, new and old, for some BBQ and whiskey+beer tasting evening. We started out at this lively place in Red Hook. I'd passed by before but never stopped for food. It was a Saturday evening (1830) but oddly enough, despite the fact that the large space was packed, we managed to get seats-- separate tables at first for our group of 8, then a long picnic table when it was vacated. By the way, it's self-seating.

Food: delicious and filling. I had the brisket, Mac and cheese and Cornbread. That CORNBREAD was absolutely divine. I couldn't quite finish the Mac and cheese, though this in no way takes away from the delicious cheesiness at its core. The brisket, now the brisket and i weren't the best of friends. It was decent, though I think the fatty aspect of it threw me off. I don't like too much fat on my brisket, and thought these particular slices were a bit much. I had a Hard Cider on tap to complement my meal and really enjoyed it.

Oh, and the service was really good. I asked way too many questions at the front and they dealt with me. That always enthuses me. So a solid 4.5 from me.

As always, happy eating and drinking. MarieMG",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"TL;DR: Texas girl v satisfied with these noms. Get ready for the wait of your life, but some of the best BBQ NYC has to offer.

On average, people spend five years of their lives waiting in lines but how many lines end with delicious delight?

At Hometown Bar-B-Que you will find no pot of gold to fill your bank, but a plethora of flavors that really just spank.

I've been twice to this joint, and I'd go a third even if it means waiting for a time that seems absurd.

Highly recommended meats of choice are below:
Don't skip it, get the brisket - I've had it lean and had it fatty, and every time the group was happy.
For a unique flavor that isn't quite texas, but is all delicious, try the wood  fired chicken for something worth finger lickin'. The taste channels Oaxaca and the meat is tender and unique, but that doesn't even take us close to the peak.
We also tried the jerk ribs for something surprising, and there is definitely a kick in the spice we recommend trying.

You can't have a bar-b-que without some dank sides, and trust when I say Hometown definitely provides. Order the cornbread, one large slice will do, and feast on honey butter flavors that will enamor you.
The mac and cheese is literally queso, there's nothing that can be beat, be sure to include this side for a meal that is complete.
The potato salad was a bit sour, too vinegary for my tastes, but thankfully we had others that were able to clear the plates.

Come hungry but not hangry - ask kindly and you'll see that the guys behind the bar are eager to give you just what you need. (plus extras if you ask nicely - both times we received extra noms with samples or almost a quarter pound extra of brisket)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

It's unnecessary though because the meats are already quite tasty. That being said, both sauces are equally good, and not like anything store-bought.

So here is the thing: two month ago in texas we had the best bbq ever at Franklin bbq. The chef in charge of the brisket told us that they helped these guys to install all the machinery and that their bbq was also good.
How not to trust them? So here we were last weekend and indeed! Brisket very yummy, ribas that melts in your mouth and awesome sides! (Delicious mac&cheese, coel slaw and beans). We were 4 and we really love, love it.
The only downside is that line was LONG AND SLOW. It took us 1.5h to order. Guys, you really need to improve this, coz u would be able to sell double!

I have never eaten a sandwich so fast in my life. It was gone in like 2 seconds because it was so delicious. Creamiest, cheesiest Mac n cheese I think I've ever had.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Came here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon in December. Venue is spacious and split in two rooms, the bar with a stage for live bands and the cafeteria room. Place is entirely made of woody, rustic material, giving it a real southern ambiance. A few other diners but started to get real busy by 2 pm. Staff were friendly, especially the ""butcher"", and respectful of our cutlery contamination request. We ordered :

Chicken tacos
Brisket
Beef rib
Beans
Mac & cheese

Tacos cannot be substituted with other meat, really small (about palm size) - but boy were they scrumptious! Ribs and brisket were a hit as well! Seasoned and done just right.Their beans had a tangy thick sauce and pieces of brisket, not a fan. Mac & cheese was very cheesy but the gooey goodness type. Cornbread that came with was mediocre. Free water is offered from a barrel.

This place garuantees a tasty meal, which you'll deff pay for. Prices are a bit steep, $30 per lb for beef ribs is one of the highest I've seen in smokehouses around NYC. Portions are shy to within standards for some items. Overall worth to check out!

Authentic bbq is pricey, as the brisket and ribs were $16/ 1/2 pound. With one side, lunch was $40.

The brisket here was the star. Great seasoning on the bark. Two thick slices made up the 1/2 pound. A line of fat down the middle of each piece added to the flavor.

The pork ribs are not memorable. They could have come from anywhere. Nice seasoning on those but I've had better ribs, more tender, in many other places. The beans didn't impress me either.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Hometown is one of my favorite BBQ spots in NYC. The menu is a little different from other BBQ spots, as they also try to bring in flavors that highlight the diversity of NYC. That means you get stuff like brisket and pulled pork tacos, Jamaican jerk and Korean ribs, Vietnamese hot wings, chicken in Oaxacan marinade, and lamb belly banh mi. Not necessarily traditional BBQ, but it works.

Everything we've had there has been good, with my favorite meats being the wood-fired chicken in Oaxacan marinade with pickled red onions and salsa verde, the turkey, and the pulled pork. The latter two come by the 1/2 pound, and the chicken comes in quarter or half sizes, of which we usually get the half and have leftovers. All are excellent in flavor and texture, and are never dry.

My favorite sides are the backyard potato salad (more like cold seasoned whipped mashed potatoes, which doesn't sound that great written out, but it's delicious and I love it), the collard greens with smoked pork shoulder, and the Hometown slaw (vinegar-based and a nice way to lighten up the meal). Never really had a bad side there, but those are our go-tos.

We haven't actually had the stomach space to order the ribs or tacos or sandwiches yet (mostly because we love ordering our favorites), but hopefully someday.

While the food is excellent, the wait at Hometown is usually pretty long, my least favorite part of going. If you are lucky and get there at the right time, it could be around 30-40 minutes, so not terrible. If you end up there at a more peak time (like we did on our last visit, waiting ~75 minutes, and it wasn't even a particularly good weather day), it's not much fun, especially being tortured by the sights and smells of delicious BBQ for that long.

I'm definitely a BBQ connessiour having had it all over the country, including the Mecca's of Franklin BBQ in Austin TX and Oklahoma Joe's in Oklahoma City. On a random Tuesday afternoon, no line at all luckily. I've been pretty disappointed at all of the hyped BBQ places in New York and this place.....joins that category. Maybe New Yorker's just don't understand nor had truly great BBQ before. Being so hyped I tried a bit of everything they were famous for. The spare ribs were good, not special. Not great bark and really not all that tender either. The brisket was definitely under seasoned but super tender. Not that impressive. The lamb belly being on their specialties was the most disappointing. The meat was rather tough in its stringy strands and absolutely drowned in grease.

- Food is good. Not gonna deny them that

First off, I've never had BBQ down south (heard it's supposed to beat anything up here) so I don't have that to compare it to. However, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and will be back. We went Saturday when they opened and there was already a line that was wrapping around to the door. Took us about 25 minutes to get to order. Staff was so nice and energetic! I got the pulled pork sandwich, girlfriend got the lamb belly, and we got the potato salad as well as mac and cheese.

The pulled pork sandwich was delicious. It definitely had a little kick to it as well. The  lamb belly was soooo good, very tender and flavorful. Mac and cheese was delicious, but the potato salad was just okay. I like potato salad with chunks of potato in it, this was more of a mashed potato salad, also was a bit sour too, not sure what they put in it.

Total came out to about $50 so definitely a bit pricey but would come back again for sure.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"First of all...there will probably be a line, so just be prepared. You can have a drink while you wait, so that's a plus. I had a pear margarita which was so good and very unique. There was a great selection of beer too! The BBQ was so good. Great portions, prices are high, but I feel like that's on par for NY and BBQ. The beef rib was huge! The brisket was tender, juicy and delish. The sides were all great. The potato salad is actually mashed, but we all liked it. The slaw was nicely dressed, not dry but not soupy. Corn bread... good

We don't live in Brooklyn, but we would recommend it. If you're traveling there, we'd say check it out. We were not sad we waited in the line!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"We drove all the way from Queens and had to order standing outside, only to find out that they do not accept cash, because they do not want ""contact"" because of the corona virus. Seriously? Our order was for $75 and they still turned us away. Mind you, we're two Asians as well. Meanwhile we went to Dallas BBQ, spent half the amount for more food, and they greeted us with smiles and took our cash. Hometown BBQ seems like a bunch of paranoid pretentious hipsters. If you're so paranoid, why does the staff hang out in a group outside, smoking, with no gloves or face masks?  Will never step foot there again.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,Best BBQ place I've ever been to... Beef brisket is very very tender and sometimes you'll also get a good portion of burnt ends added which are super awesome. The beef rib is huge but so so tender and good. Pork and lamb both have very robust flavors as well!! Cornbread is a little too on the sweet side though.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"First of all, I cook meat myself. I grill it, I smoke it, I kebab it. I've enjoyed a couple of Dutch oven roasts. I've got my butcher on speed dial haha. Anyway, I'm not a pro but I think I know meat.

Now I know lines too. Grew up in Russia. But this one was WTFL. Way too fnckiug long. That's subjective. But objectively it really built up the hype. And honestly disappointed. Though I'm all about brisket. The other meats we tried were ok, my point is I won't judge those, BUT THE BRISKET WAS OVERCOOKED.

And the bill was definitely not a pleasant surprise.

Enjoy!",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Everything was so flavorful and tender. I was definitely not disappointed! I loved the pulled pork sandwich which was large and meaty. The lamb belly and mac and cheese are also must tries. The Mac and cheese was very saucy and not dry at all - just the way I like it.

My only criticism would be the potato salad and the fact that the lamb belly was too oily / fatty. I'd still 100% recommend that you try the lamb as it's unique and very tasty but it might be easier to stomach if shared instead of eating a half pound of delicious fattiness all by yourself. Next time I would skip on their potato salad which came out mashed (instead of chunky) and a little too tart for my liking.

Overall, I can't wait to be back to try more of their menu item if I can resist getting my own pulled pork sandwich.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Waited 2 hours in line for their brisket on Memorial Day! Perhaps it was the crowds but the brisket wasn't as good as I remembered it to be. I love super fatty pieces but this time, the meat was too lean and a bit dry
That said, I love all their other menu items like the Viet wangz with an incredible spicy sauce; the pastrami bacon and their roasted chicken with verde sauce
Go early so you don't risk them selling out! We couldn't get the ribs or lamb belly in time",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"There are numerous ways to do Hometown Bar B Que. If you want to do it the right way, you'll take the 60 seconds to read this review.

Food:
You get the beef rib. You just read pass that statement but it did not sink in. Let me say it again, you get the beef rib. It is the best item on the menu. At $30 a lb you think it's pricy. It's not when looking at the grand scheme of things. The sides are trash and are pricy. The money being wasted towards the sides could be going towards your enormous and delicious beef rib. Two people can certainly split it with another item and be totally satisfied. Or if you think you're a hungry bastard like myself, you'll get one just to yourself. You'll get looks from other ordering this grandiose piece of meat. Tell them to fuck off. If you're a swine eater such as myself, you'll want to try the thick cut pastrami bacon. The half lb order will give you two long, soft, juicy pieces of succulent bacon. The brisket, pulled pork and lamb belly is great as well, but do not stack up when comparing the two items above. I've tried the wood fired chicken on a separate occasion, I was not impressed and remember it being a bit dry. The Korean sticky ribs present well and look great but, I would not get them again as I know how greater tasting the beef rib and thick cut pastrami bacon is. I still have not tried the sausage or any of the sandwiches. The corn bread, although big it has been slightly dry. Fix the sides and or pricing is how hometown could be better. To sum up, you get the beef rib and you get the pastrami bacon.

Dranks: (yes dranks) I'm a water drinker. I drink more than others. There is self serve 5 gallon beverage cooler with plastic cups. There is a bar, not too sure what's fully stocked, I think I grabbed a milly lite once.

Ordering: I prefer to come to hometown when I know I won't be standing on a line. However, I will not stand on line for most places, when I'm jonesing for my BBQ fix,
I'll wait a bit. Food is not brought to your table, one orders, food is placed on a tray and you pay. Certain items will be brought quickly to your table if not immediately ready. There are self serve  napkins, plates, utensils, to-go containers and additional sauces near the counter. When done eating, throw your stuff out and stack the tray. Simple.

Staff: I do not know who the gentlemen is who handles ""the meats"". Nor do I think he wants to be know as the guy who handles meat. Not sure if he's the owner, if he's not, hometown you keep that man! Always courteous, friendly and even issues a warning to customers when buying multiple beef ribs who may not know how massive they are. Sometimes there are idiots on line who ask the craziest questions and he carries on his duties. (Salutes)

Payment: They accept credit/debit. There is also a bucket with cash inside for tips near the register. I tip in cash for obvious reasons. You should too.

Parking: I'm sure this time dependent, but I never struggle with street parking when I go. Someone on yelp asked a question of safety of the neighborhood and I almost pissed my pants, you'll be fine.

Tip: This spot is CLOSED on Mondays. I can not describe the feeling of my mouth watering thinking of bbq, finding an ideal parking spot and waking to the door not being able to open it no mater how hard or which way I tried.

No, I'm not telling you the time and days I go where there isn't a line.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,LEGIT!!!  The cornbread was to die for.  The Korean sticky ribs were so good.  But that brisket...  melts in your mouth and it was all I could do not to go order another 1/2 pound...  Great find.  Glad I saw them pop up on Travel Channel or Food Network cuz I made note that I needed to stop in and feast.  And feast I did!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"If you have not been to Hometown Bar-B-Que I highly suggest you add to your to do list. For the past two years or more I've been begging Jeff to take me. Finally tonight was the night.

On a Bu2FuL Brooklyn evening we strolled over to a rustic hidden gem nestled in Red Hook. The aroma of comfort food engulfs the senses. This is a magical place with lights over head and little munchkins informing your inner Dorothy, that you're no longer in NYC but maybe back in Kansas or somewhere with a little bit of Texas.

The ambience is spot on, the drinks are fire, and the food is just the greatest. I started out with the pear margarita which was recommended by a fellow diner. Jeff had Tito's and soda.  Jeff was also in charge of placing our order.  Boy did he deliver - we enjoyed smack your mama good Texas - style queso mac + cheese, collard greens with smoked pork shoulder, brisket by 1/2 pound which was mmm mmm mmm good, Jamaican jerk baby back ribs, which was not only smoked to perfection, moist, but also fell off the bone, and last but not least pork belly deliciousness.

Yes, we ate every last bite, the music had me swaying from side to side.  I listened to everything from Tom Petty to Lynyrd Skynyrd. Let's just say I was such a happy camper I even passed on ice cream because Hometown had me covered!

Not only is Hometown Zagat's number 1 rated BBQ joint in NYC it is also #hatapproved. Plus the flavors to boot! Might I add that in my opinion it is worth the trek from anywhere, plus they also have live music. Oh yeah, and Jeff likes the beef rib.  I think it's his go to menu item there along with the pork belly.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,Sooo good. Holy cow. Best bbq out of Texas. Long wait but so much fun. The drinks are amazing. They take credit cards. Everyone is chill. You wait on a really long line but it's totally worth it. Grab some drinks while you wait. Yum,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"No food is worth a two hour wait.  Be advised, Saturday afternoons can be incredibly busy.  We came, we waited, we left and thought if we came back mid-afternoon it would be less crowded.  Well, we were wrong.  There were even move folks there in line.  So, we landed our spot and stood and stood and stood some more.  After 30+ minutes we progressed about 10 feet in the line.  We left, looked for another spot to eat unsuccessfully as EVERY NYC restaurant seems to think EVERY person wants brunch until 3 p.m. on weekends.  We then had some amazing bourbon at Widow Jane and circled back around (30 minutes later).  The folks who had been behind us had progressed to maybe the half way point.
One CLEAR sign that there is an issue, 90% of the tables were empty the entire time we were in line, however folks were waiting hours in line.  If the place was properly managed, the line would move quicker and the tables would turn over.  For goodness sake, its BBQ not fine French dining.
Bar area - server in the back had ZERO interest in serving anyone who was not directly in front of him.  After a 10 minute wait, I went to the other bar and god a Bloody Mary with a tasty piece of sugared bacon. Yum.  
As for the food, I will never know.  No place is worth this type of wait.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Went to the Hometown on a Saturday afternoon and the line was insane. We got there around 5ish, and waited about 1.5 hours. The lamb belly is really good, the brisket is surprisingly not dry but really juicy. My favourite was the bacon and beef ribs, very fatty and smoky. The sides are not bad as well.

Later that night, there's live music at the restaurant.

Generally, it was a good experience, the food was awesome, but it got a bit too heavy after couple bites, so the corn bread and banana pudding definitely helped.

One thing tho, I ordered the Korean sticky ribs because I'm curious about how an American bbq restaurant is gonna present Korean bbq flavour, but I was  pretty disappointed about it, the ribs were kinda dry and very salty. I will not order it again.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,Ah... we returned with much higher expectations this time. And now of course I have to unfortunately take back everything I previously said. This place has gone way downhill. I no longer consider it a legitimate BBQ contender in NYC or anywhere else.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"They need to stop featuring this place on the Food Network, Bon Appetit, Epicurious, or wherever else, because...all you are doing is causing people like me to feel aggrieved and jipped when we finally make it out of here.

The first impression when you walk in the door is the ventilation (or lack thereof).  I don't think they actually HAVE an AC unit in here.  I understand it's Winter now, but when I went here on a warm day during Fall, holy guacamole.  It is uncomfortably hot...you will be sweating just standing still.  

Which leads me to my next point.  You will stand still. For a long time.  The line is usually long and they have ONE(1) person taking meat orders and preparing meat at the counter.  I have literally 0 clue as to why the owner doesn't hire a second person to take and cut meat orders. . . the line would move twice as fast. Instead of waiting 60 minutes on line, you may ""only"" wait 30 minutes. WOW.  I mean, really.  They have such a large establishment...but the line moves at a snail's pace (Actually, I think a snail would have made it to the counter before I did).  All the while you are hungry, hot, sweaty, constantly craning your neck to the counter just to see the meat man jabbering away and laughing with customers or the staff when he is THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN MAKE THE LINE MOVE FASTER.  Bear in mind, I am writing this review over 4 months later and I am still having flashbacks of how annoyed I was waiting in this line.

Now, then.  You FINALLY get to the counter.  You FINALLY place your order. Aaaaand....2 people can't really get out of here for under $60 (BEFORE drinks). I paid $15 for 1/2 lbs of pulled pork. Not 1/2lbs of pulled pork in a lovely sandwich. Just...a pile of pulled pork on a tray.  What? Excuse me? You wait 60 minutes so you can spend $30/lbs on a pile of pork? I can go to one of the finest butchers in Brooklyn and spend $3.99/lbs on a pork shoulder.  So, we're talking about a 10x markup? Come on, guys.  Seriously. $7 for collared greens? COLLARED GREENS?! Holy cow, this food better be seriously good. I mean, you better be able to taste the quality immediately upon eati-- nope.

It was...ok.  Not bad.  Not great.  Just...ok. For food that you waited an uncomfortably stifling 30-60 minutes for. Ordered from individuals with absolutely 0 people skills.  

It's no wonder all of the 1 star reviews are exactly the same. We can't all be wrong.  We just aren't tourists willing to overlook SERIOUS inefficiencies just because the Food Network or Bon Appetit told us that this place is supposed to be good.

The Emperor's New Clothes, indeed.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Worth the long wait on line! We had the brisket, pulled pork, spare ribs, beans, and potato salad. The fat in the brisket and pulled pork just melted in your mouth. Brisket was a bit dry further from the fat, but the pulled pork was so tender. Spare ribs were decent but on the dryer side, and this was one we could've passed on. Beans were SO good and had chunks of burnt bits and the melt-in-your-mouth fat in them. First time trying the conventional southern style potato salad, which was acidic and tangy, but I liked it. It's a bit of a way out, but definitely worth at least one trip to try and must go if you're already in the neighborhood.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"If you live in NY and want quality BBQ you can't go wrong by trekking here. The food is great and for the quality is very affordable. If you come at the right time there is love music and a good crowd. You can dine here solo or as a big group and still have a good time.

My favorite is the lamb belly but try to sample it all.

As someone who's tried most of the Austin heavy hitters I truly believe hometown is equal or surpasses most of them.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Two words: Lamb belly. Get it. Love it.

Everything here is good. You can't really go wrong. Their brisket can be a little dry sometimes if you don't get the fattiest cut. Their mac and cheese is regular and bland. But everything else is on point. Love the coleslaw. Love the beans.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I've heard and read a lot of Hometown Bar-B-Que for quite some time but never quite made my way there since 1) it is inconveniently located in Brooklyn 2) I cannot fathom New York having good barbecue.

However I had tickets to a show in Brooklyn to celebrate my husband's birthday on a random weekday and figured we might as well grab early dinner there while I am at it. Plus, it'd be an early enough dinner that there will be no long lines.

We arrived around 4:30PM on a Tuesday and indeed there was no line. Nice. Since we had just eaten lunch a few hours prior, we weren't too hungry and just ordered one beef rib, 1/4 pound of pulled pork, and a small order of smoked pit beans. We had originally wanted to order 1/4 pound beef brisket as well but the gentleman said brisket orders must be at least 1/2 pound so we opted out. We got our food immediately and sat ourselves down to eat and grabbed some free water.

- Beef Rib: Our one beef rib weighed just over 1.5 pounds. Priced at $30/pound, this thing costed us $47! Damn... Just sucks knowing half the cost is the bone itself. This beautiful piece of meat was tender, but not the fall-off-the-bone tender I had anticipated. The flavor was really, really good and I can see why this is one of the most popular items to order here at Hometown.

- Pulled Pork: I wasn't expecting much since I did not read a lot of reviews of the pulled pork but I had thought pulled pork is just pulled pork. But no. These were definitely one of the best, if not the best pulled pork I've ever had. So full of flavor even without any barbecue sauce. Juicy, buttery soft, and succulent.

- Smoked Pit Beans: These were absolutely delicious. It had bits of burnt ends. Very smokey. Slightly spicy. I really enjoyed this.

Hometown serves some damn legit barbecue and I am so glad we have option to just make the drive to Brooklyn for good barbecue if we crave it and not have to fly South. Now when people ask me does New York City have any good barbecue spots I can finally say yes. Can't wait to come back.

By the way, you will leave the establishment smelling like barbecue and it will linger... not sexy. Don't go anywhere important afterwards.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"If the smell of food makes your mouth water the minute you step into a place, you know it's a winner.

The place was pretty packed Sunday around 3pm, with the line reaching past the doors. It did move pretty quick though (about 30-45 min wait) and we had some beer while we waited. We got the beef rib, brisket, homemade sausage, medium Mac & Cheese and some cornbread. Clearly, we came to eat!

The sausage and the beef rib were out of this world good. So packed with flavor, and the beef rib slid right off the bone. I also loved the cornbread, perfect balance between soft and firm. Mac and cheese was very good and very cheesy but would have liked a little kick - maybe some sharp cheddar or cayenne pepper could have done the trick. I was surprised at how disappointing the brisket was - the top layer was nicely cooked but the rest was very bland and chewy. Either way, very solid BBQ place. I also really loved their sauces, the hot sauce and the sticky sauc

You order everything yourself at the counter/bar and the prices are fair. Great place, definitely worth the trip out to Red Hook!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I remember hearing of this place online. I was impressed to hear of the owners travels to the Texas Hill Country, and how he learned much of making bbq. The spot it's at is a little out of the way. There is not too much in Red Hook overall, but it's worth it to go here.

The foods that were incredible are the Korean sticky ribs, which adds a nice unique flair to this bbq place. In honor of the Texas theme to this place, they have excellent brisket!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Wow what a difference a night can make. Came in tonight on Saturday night at 6:20 and we ordered our food at 8:40. One person taking orders and prepping the meat. One.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Congratulations are due at Hometown BBQ for running a restaurant according to the life coping strategies outlined in the book ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck.""

This is the first time in my life I have decided I would never return to a restaurant before I ordered my food.  They show no respect for their customers. They intentionally made all this hard.  I expect this place still be closed within three years.

They staff their service line the same way a lonely, deserted, BBQ place in a converted gas station in central Texas that on a good day sees fifty customers would.  I guess that's for ""authenticity"" or some nonsense. There's one guy cutting meat and chatting up the customers, one person on the register who also serves side dishes in between credit card swipes.   There's more than a hundred people in line, the ones at the front have been in it, standing, for ninety minutes.

Having a couple of dudes serving counter-style BBQ is fine if you're the only place to eat within 30 miles on Hiway 290 on the way from Austin to Houston, but if you're in Brooklyn and you've got hundreds of people waiting more than ninety minutes in ninety degree heat (inside!) to order food, staffing one person cutting meat and one person on a register is aggressively disrespectful of your customers.  

Now, if you're wearing a uniform and have a badge and gun, forget the line!  Go straight ahead of everyone, order your food and get out of there while the civiliams swelter.  I guess you're paying for it later, right? (Funny how food got delivered to cops without money changing hands while I was there.  Twice.)  Yeah, I'm getting the vibe now.  Nothing improves the relationship between the citizenry and law enforcement like watching a couple of cops get free food in less than two minutes when you've been waiting more than an hour to just place an order (and pay) in the line they just cut.

Want water while you wait?  They've got two big water-coolers available with cups at hand.  They're empty.  Go to the bar and ask for water?  They point to the empty water containers.  Point out that they are empty?  Bartender disappears, completely.  

There are at least four BBQ places in NYC that have BBQ that is as good or better than this place.  Not only that, these are places with air conditioning, plenty of staff and ice water.  Your other options are places that at least try to deal with rushes by adding extra staff...places that give a  damn about their customers, places that buy fans, places that make sure everyone has water to drink when asking them to stand inside ninety degree dining rooms.

But, I stayed because I wanted to know if the food was good enough to justify even part of any of what I went through to get it.  Nope.  The BBQ was over-smoked, greasy and so heavily coated with creosote it should come with a cancer warning label.  The sides dishes were better, i.e., essentially equivalent to the sides served at Hill Country, Dinosaur, The Mighty Quinn or Morgan's.  Their sauce is BBQ flavored ketchup in one case, and doctored Thai red chili sauce in the other.

Don't waste your time, even if you live in Red Hook.  Let it die.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"One word: WOW!!! This place is a hidden gem in a quiet Brooklyn town. My friends and I tried the:

1) spare ribs: beware that 1/2 lb is only 2 pieces, my american education did not teach me proper mental measurements so I was disappointed to see how little 1/2 pound really is. The meat was juicy and well seasoned and very tender buuuuut not as good as the brisket

2) brisket: can not stop thinking about this melt-in-your-mouth, savory, tender, so beautifully seasoned meat. I wish I had another stomach so I could eat more of it. This is a MUST GET!!

3) Thai chicken wings: came out a lot later than the rest of our order. They're pretty flavorful (sweet and spicy) but to be honest, kind of annoying to eat-- they're SUPER sticky. I wouldn't order this again

4) beans: great smoky, spicy flavor with tiny chunks of meat to surprise you. Great side dish

5) corn bread: decent carb to go with your meal, though it was kind of dry.

Overall, as a CA native, probably one of the best BBQ places I've had (especially the brisket!!), comes pretty close to places I've tried in Kansas. I do wish they did some sort of ""meal deals"" where you could get an entree with sides together because it was too pricy to get everything separately.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I'm the guy who risked getting thrown off Yelp for giving Di Fara 3 stars and I struggled over how much to downgrade Hometown for not being the most user-friendly establishment.

The first time I went it was late on a weeknight and they were out of most things. Today I went at 5pm and waited on line more than a half hour and had to sit at the bar since the tables were taken.

The brisket and spare ribs were good, the latter with some variant on a Texas dry rub that maintains the peppery char but adds some sweetness. Although I urge you to try the meat sauceless at first to get the pure effect, the sauces themselves are worth trying. Unusual offerings like lamb belly and pastrami bacon pop up but I wanted to try to the basics; some of the things look a bit too Brooklyn. Thumbs up for the ZZ Top and Thin Lizzy soundtrack.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Never did I think that any bbq joint could dethrone my actual hometown favorite - (yelp.com/biz/dinosaur-ba… but Hometown in Redhook may have done it...

What's so great about Hometown?  Pretty much EVERYTHING! *

The vibe is cool.  Raw and natural elements for the walls, flooring, tables, seating.  It's super rustic. I love the distressed american flag painted on the wall too.  And then there are the twinkle lights draped on the ceiling.  Who doesn't love sitting for dinner under a canopy of twinkle lights?

The food is top notch.  Their pulled pork - super tender and flavorful.  The wood fired chicken with its marinade and salsa verde has a delicious kick to it.  Add a drizzle of Hometown's Hot & Sweet bbq sauce - idk how but it works sooooo well with the verde!  And then there's the sides - mac + cheese with that bonus queso pour over top - ohmygosh.  So creamy.  So cheesy.  A little spicy.  Just ... epic.  Order a large!  I'm also a big fan of their beans - tender in the thickest and tastiest sauce.  Hubs orders the collard greens and I'm told they're also really really good.

Fair warning - depending on what time you arrive - the line can be out the door.  And it moves slowly.  But the food will be worth it!  Price-wise it's a little bit more than some other bbq joints (where you may get a sandwich AND side for $12 - Hometown only gives you the sandwich) - but again - the food is really really good.  

I'm also a little bit obsessed with their 'sticky' bbq sauce. It's thick and rich and a little bit sweet and I have no shame filling up a few extra 'to-go condiment cups' with the sauce for my leftovers.  Both their bbq sauces are delish but the 'sticky' version is my fav.  So so good.

Hometown is a must-try in the city if you're in need of some fantastic BBQ.  Get. Over. To. Redhook.

* ok - so there's one thing that isn't so great and that's the fact that sometimes Hometown runs out of food.  Last time we stopped for dinner they were out of pulled pork - which broke my heart a little bit.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Solid option for BBQ.
Something about this place will keep drawing you in despite its location being so out of the way. Not an extensive menu but they cover the basics. The line although will look long, it does move quickly. Often the tables are full so there might be a wait to grab a table too (self seat). A few favorites of mine were the brisket, Vietnamese wings, the smoked beans. Nothing about the bacon was wow'ing personally i would skip this next time, just a slab of fat and no flavor. Usually not a huge fan of coleslaw but they make it just right not too dry but not too watery so it definitely pairs well with the meal.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

At first when you walk in it throws you off a little because you have to stand in line to order your food . The place has a really nice vibe and the food was amazing. The pastrami bacon and briskets cut like butter. The chicken wings were really spicy which I loved because I tend to lean towards spicy food and the Jamaica jerk ribs had a very distinct flavor.

There is no way only the south can do BBQ right. You're telling me NYC, the place that has mastered every other cuisine known to man, falters when it comes to combining meat, heat, and sauce in a pleasing manner? This thought had been bothering me for a while and after tossing and turning for many nights, I finally decided to round up the boys and go ""hog-wild"" at a BBQ session. This is certainly the best BBQ in NYC and is absolutely worth going out of the way for. I got pretty much one of all of the standards: brisket, pulled pork, sausage, mac n cheese, collard greens, potato salad, cornbread. All of the above were great, but the highlights for me were the pulled pork and the collard greens. My bud almost had a damn brain aneurysm he loved the potato salad so much, so do what you want with that information. We also got the Jamaican jerk ribs which you can skip. That's not traditional BBQ so i'm not counting it.

Get the:

2) Brisket - order extra moist for fatty pieces! So moist and so meaty and juicy. We got half pound for 2 people.
3) Lamb belly - I was blown away by how good this was - a little gamey if you're not into that, but I LOVED it. Half lb of this too.
4) CORN BREAD - super moist and buttery - am I eating butter? If so, let  me continue.

The korean ribs were pretty good too. But definitely get a BEEF RIB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Finally made it to Hometown Bar-B-Que! We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday. The line was long and took us an hour to order and receive our food. The line was long the entire time we were there and had even more people in it by the time we left around 8pm. If you are prepared to wait, then its not too bad, but not something I would want to do frequently. While in line, a waitress came by and allowed us to order a drink from the bar so at least you can have a drink while waiting.

Heres what we ordered:
- brisket: tender, great charbroiled flavor, kind of melts in your mouth!
- queso mac n cheese: really enjoyed this different version of Mac n cheese, the queso creates a unique flavor, creamy and tasty
- smoked pit beans: very good bbq flavored beans with smoked ends of brisket in it, great flavor
- pulled pork sandwich: less flavorfull than the brisket so add some BBQ sauce on top of it, overall very good
- cornbread: our least favorite of all the food we had, very dry and does not come with butter or jelly to help with the dryness. I would pass on this next time

There are 2 types of BBQ sauces: sticky or hot and spicy. The sticky is more of a traditional bbq sauce and was very good. The hot and spicy did not seem like BBQ sauce and more of a sauce that was meant for chicken wings. It was definitely more spicy than the sticky sauce.

Hometown Bar-B-Que has an awesome vibe and rustic feel inside with the old wooden walls and decor, American flags, mason jars, string lights on the ceiling, etc. There is live music on Friday and Saturday nights. It was a little too loud at some points with the music playing and the noise from all of the customers.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"After coming back from a weekend getaway, fighting a cold and just having an off few days... I wanted some comfort food... and my heart cried out for bbq!

I have heard good things about hometown BBQ and wanted to give it a try... so I dragged my younger brother to red hook in search for this place.

We arrived around 7pm... wasn't too bad since it looks like the dinner crowd didn't arrive yet. We first ordered our food, grab some utensils, grabbed some drinks and made our way to a picnic size table.

We ordered the cornbread, spicy Vietnamese sticky wings, chicken tacos, steak tacos and sticky ribs.

I was soooooooo impressed how delicious those tacos were... full with flavor and oh so yummy... I really just wish they were bigger.

The cornbread was smothered with melted butter on top... super yummy and wish I ordered a second slice.  

My brother seemed to enjoy the steak tacos and the sticky ribs... but he said his favorite was also the chicken tacos.

I ordered two orders of the wings... and I'm glad I did... they had to be the show stopper for me... it was amazing and soooo good.... don't bring a date here since these babies are messy!!!

I'm enjoying my wings stains on my dress... totally worth it...

Beer:
Decent selection of craft and local.  Not extensive but ok for a restaurant.

Food:
Tried a large sampling.
-Pulled Pork - favorite of the meats we tried
-brisket - flavorful, a little dry.  slices were cut thick.
-pork ribs - not bad.
-Brisket bacon - loved and was excited by the concept but it didn't live up to the hype i had in my mind.  Basically it was like their brisket just with more fat.
-baked beans were extremely smokey.  I was not a huge fan.  they were thick and hearty which i liked just overpowered by smoke.
-mac and cheese - yummy nice queso flavor going on
-cornbread - I really liked their cornbread.  Most bbq joints have cornbread just to have it as they feel it is a needed bullet list item.  These guys put some love in it.  It was dense, more moist than most cornbreads and had a nice honey/butter type of glaze on top.  It was $5 which seemed steep for cornbread but i liked it and would probably get it again.

Summary, Liked all of it, some more than others.  Their menu had a large number of other items on it that I would like to try.  I would go back and I would try the other items and still go back to some of these.  Solid bbq.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"tl;dr

Totally not worth the hype if you've had true southern BBQ.

---

Look, my wife is from Texas and I've had BBQ probably in at least six or seven different states south of the Mason Dixon line, and this is not legit.

I'm not sure what is the issue with NYC BBQ but truly we have not found a place that authentically replicates the goodness of BBQ in the South, especially that of the Texan variety.

We've heard a lot about Hometown and the hype associated with it on Eater so we combined an Ikea trip with a late lunch here on a Sunday afternoon. Drove down from the UES and it was a breeze to get to Red Hook (protip: secretly park in the Fairway parking lot haha). We knew that there was probably going to be a wait and so we braced ourselves for the wait by getting drinks from the bar. We were a little bit past the entrance into the second dining room (this makes sense if you've been there) and so about 30-40 people ahead of us = a roughly one hour wait. NBD as long as there's cider and beer :)

We FINALLY get to the front, super duper hungry, and opted to get a sampling of their most famous offerings, including the pulled pork, the brisket, the beef ribs, baked beans, collards, and a corn bread. Methinks that this is a very standard spread to judge a BBQ joint by.

We sit down, famished, and got ready to eat.

BRISKET - ruh oh. I don't know if we just got some bad pieces or what, but this is NOT ""fall apart tender."" It was mediocre to the max. Look, when I'm traveling it's very rare for me to visit a BBQ joint more than once, but if you're gonna be hit or miss about the brisket like this, then that doesn't portend well about your overall quality.

BEEF RIBS - sigh. It was dry, very heavily seasoned on the outside, but so-so on the inside. This is the equivalent cut to Korean kalbi, and I'd rather have any kalbi in K-town over this, any day. To add insult to the injury, this was $30. SAD!

PULLED PORK - this was actually pretty good :) moist and flavorful, our highlight of the day.

About the sides, the baked beans were pretty good actually (a tad bit too salty) and the collards were average (tone down the vinegar and add some sugar instead). Cornbread was a solid 3/5.

Yeaaah. When we went to Hill Country we thought it left a tad bit to be desired, but Hill Country seems like meat heaven compared to this place, AND it's more conveniently located. Unfortunately Hometown gave us no reasons to return with the so-so food. Do you really want to drive/bus/subway all the down to Red Hook just to pay $85 for a plate of aggressively mediocre BBQ? Hey, it's your money and your time...just sayin' :P",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Located in Red Hook, Hometown BBQ is quite the hotspot and popular among the surrounding neighborhood. It is also the ONLY BBQ restaurant in Red Hook, so competition is non-existent. Many foodies from all over would trek their way to this part of undeveloped town on weekends just to get a taste of Hometown BBQ's smoky and savory meats. Be sure to get here early though... because the line usually backs up very quickly. There is only one station taking orders. More accurately, there is only one person taking orders AND serving food at the same time, while another person takes the payment. You might see one helper in the back kitchen prepping and heating more food. It's basically three men operations. On average, it would take approximately half an hour to one hour before you'd get your turn. If you have the patience to wait through the line, be sure to try the brisket!

Lucky for us there was no line, just a few ppl ahead of us, which allowed us to check the menu and decide on what we wanted. Also, getting our stomach juices rumbling from the delicious scent in the air.

We shared the following:
1) quarter pound of brisket
2) a beef rib on the bone = 1 lb.
3 sides: small collard greens, beans, Mac & Cheese

The meats were not even warm, lacked the smoky flavor I expect in this type of establishment; and the rib was not fall off the bone. Disappointed

The sides were nice and hot, but the sauce in the beans were off tasting. The Mac and cheese was okay.  

Our meal cost $64., was just ehh. I can't say I'd want to give it another try. I love bbq, good bbq.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Came here on Memorial Day and the line was an hour at 2 o'clock. One thing I realized is that normal people don't eat more than a pound of meat...I recommend a little less than a pound per person if you are getting sides. They give you a price per pound, but you can get 1/3 pound and you aren't stuck in units of half a pound. If you get sides, this place will be about 40 bucks a person (not cheap).

Got the beef rib, lamb belly, brisket, and corn bread.

Cornbread was good and helps give you a break in between all the fatty meats.

The brisket is what everyone raves about. It for sure is delicious. Very tender and had lots of fatty parts. However, I didn't think it was the best item on the menu. The brisket isn't very warm so be sure to eat it soon and add a lot of sauce. I wish the cuts were a bit thinner so that it would be an easier to bite and could have more sauce.

The lamb belly was my favorite. Never had this before and it's super tender and fatty. It's served like pulled pork in the sense that there's like strips and it's not one chunk. This was the only one in which no sauce was needed. Highly recommend this one.

The beef rib is huge. You basically get one large bone and they are usually around 1.3 pounds. There are meatier cuts and fattier parts of the bone. I actually liked this better than the brisket too. It's just some super tender beef. It requires minimal sauce since it already had some flavoring.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Good BBQ is often something you have to travel for. Even in Texas, all the best 'cue is generally a car ride away.

Well, New Yorkers, it's time to put that friend with a car to good use. You need a ride to Red Hook. That's where the best BBQ in NYC is.

Not so long ago, Texas-style BBQ was impossible to find in NYC. Now, we've got an embarrassment of riches.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Hometown Bar-B-Que is well worth the trek from Manhattan!  Just hop on the SB bound ferry from Pier 11 Wall St at the cost of $2.75pp for a one-way ticket.  Be sure to take in the sights from the upper deck of the ferry platform and disembark at Red Hook.  Walk ~3/4 mile southwest down Conover St. and enjoy the scenic-industrial view until you hit Reed St. and hang a left... voila... BBQ heaven awaits.  P.S. make sure to snap a photo of Sunny's Bar along the way.  Now on to the meal!

We ordered a 1/2 lb. of the brisket, 1/2 lb. of the spare ribs, medium-sized sides of collard greens and smoke pit beans, and a small container of the whisky sour pickles.  Absolutely delicious!  Oh yeah, before I forget... remember to order yourself a draft beer or two from the friendly bartender!

The brisket was moist, tender, and perfectly balanced in terms of fat content.  Trust me, eat the fat.  You'll thank me later.  The spare ribs were well seasoned and the meat literally falls of the bone.

As far as side dishes go, we really appreciated the bits of meat mixed it with our collard greens (smoked pork shoulder) and smoke pit beans (brisket burnt ends).  I also highly recommend ordering the pickles.  The acidity cuts the heartiness and richness of the meat.  The best analogy I can think of is the use of pickled ginger to cleanse one's palate during a sushi dinner.

Plenty of attitude out of them when saying ""excuse me"" due to lack of acknowledgement for over 15 min or requesting them to refill the only available water in the place. It's pretty straightforward to be busy and at the same time point and acknowledge the only 1-5 people standing at the bar and let them know you will be with them shortly.

My favorite meal was the Lamb Belly. It was really flavorful and juicy. My least favorite was the Potato salad. Not my desired preparation. They offer two types of bbq sauces on the side.

Sides were disappointing for the most part outside of the coleslaw. Their chili style beans and the queso Mac and cheese were major let downs .

The layout is very open and spacious and service was great but commuting here with public transportation is a pain in the tush even for their 10/10 brisket .

So you can buy your food and watch singers sing.  On the other side, is where you wait on a line to order along with tables for sit down and a bar.  We waited for about an hour (quite long), but from what we heard, an hour is not too shabby.  Yikes.  We got 1/2 pound brisket, 1/2 turkey and 1/2 pulled pork.  Each was about $15 per 1/2 pound.  We enjoyed the turkey the most as it was moist followed by pulled pork and lastly brisket.  We got a large side of collard green for $9 and small Mac n cheese for $4.

I like to think of myself as a BBQ aficionado as I have tried all the best BBQ from the US in their signature styles. But you know what? I like THIS NYC style best. It's not just because they have the best beef rib I've ever eaten(they do), Its because they bbq stuff that isn't the ""standard"" bbq. The lamb belly is a good example. Never seen it on any other menu, and it might be one of the best pieces of tender meat I've EVER had. I still have the pastrami bacon and sausage on my list of things I must try.

The only two downsides. The line can be insane....like, 1 hour wait or more insane. But I don't care. I killed two drinks while waiting and then was served heaven on a brown paper tray. Second, it isn't cheap. We are in NYC so most natives are over that concern. Don't expect a cheap bbq joint because this is not it. The beef rib(one, giant flintstones size rib) was about $50. Split between two it was perfect...and oh so tender and delish. I stated after first bite, ""ok, this is better than a filet mignon, easy. Now I'm not sad I spent so much.""

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Worth trying at least once in your lifetime! Very good BBQ.

WAIT: Came on a Saturday night at 5:40 pm and it was pretty long, we waited almost an hour before we sat down with our food.  You wait in line, then order then they give you your food right away and then you look for a seat.  The line seems long but it is constantly ""moving"" so it's not too bad.  When we surveyed the line closer to 7, it was almost twice as long.

ATMOSPHERE: The inside is pretty spacious and reminds me a little bit of a barn with the ordering side having string lights and wooden tables and seats and then the other side having another bar, and longer communal tables.  There is also a bar in the ordering side so lots of people were getting drinks while they waited in line.  There are 2 bathrooms which are spacious and pretty nice.  It seemed like a good place for either a dinner for 2, dinner out with friends or a birthday get together.  The only annoying thing is when people would reserve seats before they ordered or would have 2-3 people in their group sit down to take up 5 tables for a larger group.  We had a bit of trouble finding a seat but luckily someone was leaving so we just had to wait a little until they cleared their table.  Otherwise, I didn't really see anyone wandering around unable to find seats.

FOOD: They run out of items pretty quickly.  By the time we were about to order around 6:30 they ran out of lamb belly.  By the time we were leaving at around 7:30 they ran out of spare ribs.  Go early and have a back up plan!  Also, for those that are allergic or avoiding dairy, none of the BBQ has dairy and the baked beans don't either! Everything is by the 1/2 pound except for pulled pork and turkey which I believe can be less.  1/2 pound is actually a good amount and you will be surprised how full you get.  It's not even that you're super full it's that you get OD'd or overwhelmed by the meat flavor and amount of meat/fat so you can't eat anymore.

BRISKET - the brisket is either really really good or just good.  For the pieces that have fat next to them or with them they are juicy, tender, delicious! For the pieces without fat, they are just ""good.""  Why can't they all have fat! The slices are generous so you'll have enough with 1/2 pound.  At that time it was $14 for 1/2 pound.  The other thing to note about their meats are that they are lightly seasoned meaning the meat on its own is not super flavorful.  What is the best part is the BBQ sauce(s) which are delicious.  I doused my BBQ in the sauce...which some could argue is not true BBQ or that it drowns out the flavor of the meat but believe me, it needs sauce.  

SPARE RIBS - pretty good although I think I prefer baby back.  These seemed a little ""tougher"" and with less meat on the ribs themselves.  A little more like beef jerky in some parts? Had a little more flavor than the brisket.

BEEFY RIB - you can't choose how many pounds 1 rib is and 1 rib ran about 1.5 pounds when I was there.  It was $30/pound so definitely pricey.  This alone is enough for 1 person to finish.  I would recommend sharing if possible because it is a lot of food and you get kind of nauseous eating all of the meat.  The meat is well seasoned, fatty, flavorful and a little ""stringy."" It also tastes goo with the sauce.  I think I prefer Phil's BBQ's beefy rib in San Diego but not sure if it's because of the size and that the beef didn't seem as stringy.

As for sides, I would really recommend getting something like coleslaw or cornbread...we got the baked beans and it tasted so similar to the rest of the meat that it was hard to eat that and everything else.  You need something to cut through the meat.

Overall, it sounds like I didn't enjoy my food but I did! I just wish I ordered less so I could have enjoyed it more instead of tapping out about 3/4 of the way through (although the leftovers were amazing!).  I also wish the meat had more flavor but perhaps that is their style of BBQ.  Like I said, the sauce is very good and some BBQ places pre-sauce their meats so I appreciate that we can do this on our own.  Definitely worth trying, it's a trek to get out to Red Hook but you won't be disappointed! Just go early to avoid long lines and meat running out.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Loved the music, rustic decor and food! The food was worth the wait, we had the brisket, spar ribs, coleslaw, and potatoes salad:) the line gets long and the smoke kinda bothered my eyes but over all a good night of dining out.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"NO FOOD left at 8pm on a Tuesday.  Now that's just unacceptable.  As a chef in the business, I can't imagine selling out of 14 of the 19 things on my menu and when I asked what happened the person in charge gave me a lecture on how BBQ takes 14 hours to cook and when they are OUT they are OUT! Well that I get, but your telling me you were so not in touch with your business you had no idea you were going to be busy or you simply did not prepare enough food.  This place gets an F.  I highly recommend you call here before coming to see if they have any FOOD.
I drove from Monmouth Co., NJ because I heard the ribs here were good, but what I can tell you after a 2 hour car ride is: they don't have any food for me to review.  This place is run very poorly.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Move over Mighty Quinn, Hometown is making you out to be the next Applebee's. Hometown has taken a page out of Dino BBQ and Mighty Quinn, keeping the best parts and tossing the bad. Caveat, the one major downside is the long wait. If you come hungry, like I did, and encounter what looks to be a not-so-bad looking line of 20 people, what you're really looking at is upwards of a 45 minute wait. If the two dining rooms were larger or more accommodating in space, perhaps the line can move faster but anyways, onto the food.

We ordered a 1/2 lb of the following proteins: lamb belly, brisket, spare rib, on top of one homemade sausage, and mac'n cheese on the side. The total came out to roughly $65. Be aware, this is a ton of food. Enough to feed 3 properly, and more than enough to stuff 2 people.

Took my first bite of the lamb belly and knew right away, I am not going back to Mighty Quinn's. The lamb belly is ridiculously juicy with a few slices mixed with fat. The flavor is naturally gamier, so if you are not into that, I'd avoid. The spare rib broke down like butter, easy to cut, packing a good combination of lean and fat. The homemade sausage is wrapped with some pepper or peppercorn, giving it a distinct flavor.

Not much else to say other than see you soon.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Definitely some of the best BBQ I've had in NYC. I knew the lines can get crazy on the weekends, but I was lucky to swing by around 2pm on a Wednesday and it was not crowded at all! The guy working the counter was super nice and helped us figure out what to order. The brisket was incredible. Highly recommend checking this place out!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Food was a 3. Service was a 1, hence the 2 stars. We seriously waited over an hour just to order. So my bf decided to get a drink to make the time pass.  He ordered makers on the rocks and the bartender 1 gave him probably 2 sips of bourbon.

There was only one ""butcher"" and one cashier for a place the size of a small barn. Too bad Brooklyn hasn't mastered efficiency because it was not worth the wait. The brisket was eh and the ribs were good. The Korean ribs were prob the best but very salty.  

We sat at the bar to eat and bartender 2 was better, much more generous and chill.

We eat bbq all over and know many good joints that move quickly and deliver better quality. Maybe for Brooklyn this place is okay.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Honestly the best Bar-B-Que I've had in so long! The portions are great. The meat is fall off the bone. The only negative was the potato salad. It was basically pickled mashed potatoes, which none of us was fond of. The alcohol/wine/beer menu was pricey. Definitely coming back!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Ugh, so good. Finally made the drive from N.J. to Red Hook to try this place. I've had samples from big Apple bbq fest in the past, but I knew I wanted to eventually come to the establishment

Atmosphere: Got there on a Sunday about 15 min before opening, and there was already about 15 people ahead of us in line. Tip is if you're going for lunch, go before opening! It's first come first serve and one counter when I was there so the process is a bit slow.

Food: two of us ordered way too much but everything looked so good that we had to try it. Got a beef rib (you only order the rib, you can't ask for a specific amount of it, and they charge you whatever the rib is, which is usually 1.5-2lbs), two slices of brisket (HUGE slices), Vietnamese chicken wings (3 big wings for $9), small side of queso mac and cheese, small side of bbq pit beans, and side of cornbread. Total came out to about $85! Pricey, but with the rib alone costing $40, it would've been a much more reasonable price had we not gotten it.

Beef rib: juicy, huge, fall of the bone. A little too much fat for me but very filling.

Brisket: huge! Delicious, tender, albeit a bit on the drier side, but that is easily mediated by eating it with the bbq sauce

Vietnamese wings: delicious! Crispy and sweet and the meat is so moist. Love it.

Cornbread: some of the best cornbread I've had. Soft, moist, bits of corn, very sweet. It's a good size too.

Queso Mac and cheese: tied with cornbread for my favorite side dish. So damn creamy and delicious. I can't think about it without wanting it.

Bbq pit baked beans. Just okay. A little too thick for my liking.

Service: Great and friendly. Self service other than ordering at the counter first.

I 100% plan to go back and try more and eat more Mac and corn bread. Might skip out on the expensive beef rib though haha.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"One of the best BBQ I have been to. Very juicy and tender.

The line was long. We went around 2:30 pm and it was almost out the door. It was approximately a 40 minute wait.

I would definitely suggest getting the brisket.  It was the bomb. I would come here again.

P.S. my gf loves their cornbread",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Red Hook is a trek, but once you're there it's a magical wonderland of nature and BBQ. And home to some of the best brisket I've had in a long long time - definitely the best brisket I've had in New York. That's an absolute must, along with the lamb belly. Also had the turkey but I probably wouldn't order it again as it wasn't as heavenly as the other meats. Personally the baked beans and slaw that I got on the side didn't measure up to the main events, but they were totally tasty.

The peeps behind the counter are intimidating at first glance (the super hardcore BBQ dude type) but they were all really nice and helpful. You seat yourself, grab a drink at the bar, and overall it's just a very low-key and relaxed way to stuff your face!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Hometown corn bread, I love you. Brisket, pulled pork, ribs, I like you but the corn bread has my heart. Long lines, I hate you but the hour wait on line is worth it.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Take it from me....we waited about 1.5-2 hrs in line and got Mac and cheese, Cole slaw, corn bread, potato salad, beans and a pulled pork salad with banana pudding, Korean chicken wings and the half chicken

All in all...it was a 4 out of 5; the wait was ridiculous and the bbq was overall okay but better than pig beach. Their pulled pork sandwich is INCREDIBLE.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"The food here is absolutely delicious. But, do you really want to wait in line for 45 minutes for it (FYI the line which took 45 mins started at the main entrance doors). Not really sure why it takes so long because everything is already cooked and they just cut and weigh for you.
I would go again but only if the line is way shorter and moves way quicker.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"After standing in line for 62 minutes, I gotta say the food is pretty amazing. It's worth the wait. In NYC, we are use to waiting..waiting for the train, waiting for the bus, waiting in the lines at the grocery store but this line, not only is the light at the end of the tunnel but the energy of everyone eating around you just gets you even more excited in a strange way. It's a cool place to be especially when the live music happens. With a ferry to Red Hook, it's a nice walk and definitely worth the wait.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I arrived here exactly at the time that they opened and thought that I got here pretty early for bbq food. To my surprise, there was already a line inside full of hungry people. Luckily, it moved fast and I was still able to find a seat after ordering my food. People that came a bit later than I did had to wait for a table to open up. Between two people, we definitely ordered too much food. I wanted to try a bit of everything and got a bit carried away. Conveniently they leave take out boxes readily available for you to pack your food in case you don't finish. I guess this happens quite often.

Things I would order again:
-1/2 lb Brisket- This is probably my favorite item out of everything we ate and taste delicious with the sauces on the table. The brisket is very moist and flavorful. Cooked perfectly!
-2 orders of the Vietnamese hot wings- The wings had a spicy kick to them and were pretty tasty. Probably could have just stuck to one order of it since we ordered so many other items but I enjoyed them.
-1/2 lb Pastrami bacon- Who doesn't like bacon? Two slabs seems a bit much since it is so oily. Might be a better idea to get it in a sandwich or bring it home and make your own sandwich like I did with my leftovers!

Things I would skip next time:
-Korean sticky ribs- The sauce was a bit too salty. I would skip this next time or try their regular ribs.
-1/4 lb Homemade Sausage- I am not a fan of this item. I thought it had a weird taste to it.
-Potato salad- I was surprised that the potatoes were all mashed, since I expected the potatoes to be in chunks. I felt like my batch had a bit too much vinegar in it.

I would come back here when I'm craving BBQ food again but I definitely need to control how much I order!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"This place is pretty amazing! Although im not a fan of country, they had a live band playing in another room which is nice.

From afar the portion sizes look small/normal like any other place but when you get upfront and they give you your order, it's a lot more than you expect, or at least i expected. I got the brisket, mac n cheese, cornbread, and potato salad. Again they give you good portions for your money! Where you order, you see the guys chopping up the beef right infront of you and they're pretty pleasant people as they interact with you.

The food here is really really good and very filling. This is BBQ done right!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

We ordered brisket, the jerk ribs, slaw, potato salad, and whisky pickles. The pickles were awesome.  The brisket was lean and fall apart tender. The slaw was ok, and the potato salad was mashed instead of chunky.

I have to admit, the whole cafeteria-style do everything yourself left a little bit to be desired...I was constantly looking for water, napkins, silverware, etc, and had to get up several times. For the price (it was over $60 for 2 of us) I would have liked a little more service, to be honest.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I live near Borough Hall in downtown Brooklyn, was by myself for a few days and did not want to cook, so I decided to try Hometown BBQ in Red Hook, since I heard so much about it and never been.  I took the B61 bus from Borough Hall towards Red Hook. The bus stop (Beard St/Van Brunt St) is 100 yards from the restaurant (return is another short block further - at Van Brunt & Van Dyke). Hence easy access by public transit. \

The place is a large warehouse-type setting with typical BBQ wood picnic benches, with a bar. Whether eating in or taking out, you go up to the counter to place your order. I ordered  1/2 pound of the beef brisket, 1 half-rack of the Jerk baby back ribs, 1 slice of pastrami bacon (1/4 pound) and a side of pickles to go. The person taking your order dished up the beef brisket and side dish of pickles and gave me a number (and had to sit at a table) to wait for the ribs and bacon. It came within 3 minutes.

OMG, the pastrami bacon (a thick slice of bacon with pastrami seasoning on the sides) was delicious. The Jerk baby back ribs were heavenly - flavorful with just the right amount of spiciness. Be hungry- the half-slab of ribs had over a pound of meat on them!  The brisket is so good you have dreams about it. It is very juicy and flavorful. I have had a lot of BBQ and this was the best brisket I have ever had. Everything was outrageously good except for the pickles, which were good, but ordinary. All this provide lunch and dinner for 3 nights (6 meals total) -supplemented by my own veggies. Cost with tip less than $55.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"One of the most painful process I had ever experienced in getting food. We came around 6:30pm on a Sunday, and the line wrapped around the restaurant. It looked like a pit style kind of restaurant, so we assumed the line would go fast. Boy were we wrong. It was painfully slow, and by the time we realised how slow it was, we had invested too much time. (Very) long story short, we were on line for 2 hours and very hangry and starving by the time we got to the front. There were only 2 people taking orders - One for the BBQ and one for the sides. Oh, also, drinks were at the bar... totally different. You cant even get a soda at the front register. It was a very inefficient way of running a business.

The food was SPECTACULAR. It was very good barbeque, but we were a bit cloudy in our judgement given we waited for food for so long, we weren't sure if it was good, or we were just starving. We got the 1/2lb of brisket, the pulled pork sandwich, the Korean sticky ribs and banana cream pudding. Everything was good. The brisket was very tender and flavorful. The pulled pork was great as well. The sauce on the Korean ribs were outstanding. The banana cream pudding was also a great dessert.

In total: service is 0 stars, the price (grossly overpriced) is a 1 star and the food a 5 star. Overall experience: 2 stars. Yeah, the wait was THAT bad. Coupled with the overall way they were taking orders and the snail-like pace of the workers - I will most likely fly to Texas for BBQ before I return here.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"We got the lamb belly banh mi and Vietnamese wings.
The wings were crispy from outside and juicy from inside, they had a nice sweet and tangy flavor with just enough spicy kick. The lamb banh mi was just exceptional, it was so fatty and juicy and the pickles perfectly balanced the fattiness.
It was a sandwich you would think about for a long time.  A must visit for all the meat lovers.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"This is, undoubtedly, the best BBQ I've had in NYC thus far. As a Texan, I'm always on the hunt for good brisket. Most places in NYC, I can simply look at the brisket and know it's not right or it won't be tender. This is the first place I've visited where one look at the brisket had my stomach jumping for joy.

I had the brisket sandwich and the baked beans when I visited. I usually NEVER get sandwiches, but I really recommend grabbing one here if you're not looking to have leftovers. It was the perfect portion size and came with a deliciously buttered bun. And that brisket....boy oh boy!  That was tasty. It had so much flavor that you really didn't need BBQ sauce, which is the true sign that brisket was done well. The baked beans also had a TON of brisket in them, so it was like a two for one!

I'd honestly just come here for the ambiance. I loved the big, open layout and the fact that they have musicians play while you're throwing down on a rib or drinking a beer. This place gave me hometown vibes, and that's the type of experience I want when it comes to dining out.

Catch a water taxi. Grab a bus. Take a Lyft. Do whatever you have to do to get to Red Hook to try this place. Some well smoked meats will be waiting for ya!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Not worth the trip out to Red Hook bc you can get much better bbq in Manhattan. I liked the dark interior and the large space, but it was still a bit difficult to get a table. Nothing was impressive and I found myself eating just because the food was already paid for. Everything was cooked way too dry. The best item was probably the brisket. I liked the large slice but would have liked fattier pieces. The sausage had a moist and slightly mushy texture with an overwhelmingly cheesy taste. The chicken was the worst given how dry it was. Wasn't big on the sauce either, but I hate cilantro so I admit I'm a bit biased here. The Korean ribs tasted like they decided to slap some type of sweet Asian sauce and a bunch of scallions on ribs and consider that ""Korean"". They also weren't falling off the bone as good ribs would. Also got the Mac n cheese, which lacked flavor and texture. Would've been much better with some bread crumbs on top.

Update Feb 2019 - I got a chance to try hometown bbq again and had a way better meal this time around. The meat was better quality and cooked better. The brisket was so tender and melted in my mouth. The chicken actually surprised me with how juicy it was since it was so dry last time. The sauce on the Korean sticky ribs tasted better but I'm still not too big on them. This time, I tried a few more items too like the Vietnamese wings which came with a cilantro ranch sauce. The wings were crispy and the sauce was so good with a good amount of spice, I didn't really need the ranch. The pastrami bacon had a good crunch once I bit into it but I felt that it was better without the honey mustard sauce it came with. The chicken tacos were so juicy and I loved that they make their own shells. Also tried the sliced turkey which was good but wouldn't order it on my own. It felt like it could've had a sauce with it. The lamb belly banh mi was one of my favorites of this meal, after the brisket. I never would've thought of eating lamb belly but it works really well in this sandwich.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"This place is so overrated to say the least! We waited for 90 minutes on what seemed like a never ending line. I have never in my life waited this long, not for the best places in NYC. Food was good, but I would never go back if I have to wait for this long....so unnecessary! To make things worse, by that time some of the things on the menu were sold out. It seems that the owners/management don't know how to run this place properly. The guy who takes your order, cuts and weights the meat, and also makes sandwiches so everyone else has to wait. Then, you move on to order your sides and pay with another person.

We got the brisket, pulled pork, beef rib, lamb belly, cole slaw, mac and cheese, smoked beans, and corn bread. Everything tasted delicious but my personal favorite were the beef rib and smoked beans. We slathered the meats with their hot & sweet and sticky sauces. So good!! Everything was tender and fell right off the bone.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Very good spare ribs; even better brisket.
On the sides, definitely get the mac'n' cheese, the beans, the corn bread and the collards.
Free ice water! Just like down South.
Nice tap beer.

The meh?
Potato salad - done as cold mashed potatoes and the coleslaw which was tasteless.

And
Yes the line is long and slow so they can slice up each order individually and there's just one toilet and it's noisy in the current restaurant style.

Two Yelp $$ now mean maybe $50+ for two nowadays. Based on the food quality here it's worth it. They  have the real  BBQ deal here.

Go for  the Brooklyn/NY experience.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Hometown BBQ offers an extensive and innovative menu and offerings.  When you enter you usually see long lines waiting to get to the front cutting counter, you'll have plenty of time to read the menu and chat with your friends.  The seating is very family friendly, many couples come with their kids.  The tough part really is limiting your appetite because there are so many items to select and all of it is worth trying.  Bring a big group so you can order everything to try a little of each.

The Pastrami Bacon was our favorite with an excellent mustard honey dip.  It's fatty, juicy, gooey goodness, it taste like nothing else I've had so it's hard to describe, I wanted to part with my group of friends and be alone with it and fall asleep nibbling my greasy fingers.  

The Brisket was definitely top notch, juicy but not very smokey.  The Beef Rib is like a dinosaur rib from the Flintstones, the meat falls right off the bone without trying and the meat can easily be pulled apart into little strips, it was marinated and smoked with deep smokey flavors.

The lamb belly is delicious and fatty and a little gamey, which helps it stand apart from the pulled pork which is executed to perfection.

But yes if you have to choose, go for the Pastrami bacon and Beef Ribs.  They just melt in your mouth and are maybe the reason we exist on this earth.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

It looked so good, that's why i took a mouth as soon as i sat down. The spareribs are pretty good too. Nothing much to say on this cause the beef rib just blew my mind away.

Not awful but more something you would expect at a buffet rather than a top barbecue place. The mac and cheese, beans, and collard greens were all good too. I think the mac and cheese is the one that is the more interesting. Overall, a good barbecue. If we had not ordered the lamb belly I likely would have given them 5 stars.

We went at 4:50 pm on a Sunday and waited about 45 mins.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Hometown Bar B Que: A seat yourself and order at the cash register type of BBQ joint. As a first timer, I kinda wish there was a sign. Came on a Thursday night around 6 p.m., place was pretty empty.

The goods: Wanted to try the brisket sandwich, but unfortunately they were all out of bread -- so no sandwiches (there goes 1/4 of their menu 4 hours before they actually close)! So instead had the Korean Sticky Ribs, a side of corn bread, and brisket tacos -- 3 tacos for $12, but you can't mix and match with the pulled pork or chicken tacos:(

Overall, decent/tasty food. Corn bread was dry though. Maybe one day I'll come back for those sandwiches or not, probably not.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Overall, a solid BBQ joint. It's kinda far, it's close to the IKEA and the Fairway Market, but the cue is good and the space is large and comfortable. Overall, I was happy with my meal but I really loved the table side sauces, both were made in house, I really liked the Sticky sauce and Hot and Sweet sauce. My friends and I got there at noon on a Friday and there was no wait, but 5 minutes later, the line extended to the door, so get there early. The restaurant is setup cafeteria style where you wait in line, you order at the counter and then you take your food to a table, there is seating on both sides of the restaurant. The side of the restaurant that doesn't have the kitchen or the line is much cooler, it was probably 10 degrees cooler on that side.

The food:

Lamb Belly- This was my fav item, it was more like a braised lamb belly than BBQ. It was super moist, it also had a very pronounced lamb flavor which I really enjoyed but could be off putting for some. I really liked it a lot but it was served room temp, I wish it was served hot. yelp.com/user_local_phot…

Beef Rib- The beef rib was fucking huge! It was so damn tender on the inside, the meat was so moist and juicy, the outside was nice with all the spices but had some chewy parts. Overall, it is a must order even though it is was kinda pricey at $28/pound. yelp.com/user_local_phot…

Thick Slab Pastrami Bacon- The pastrami is kissed on the grill before being served. The pastrami bacon was great and I really loved their homemade honey mustard sauce which had a little bit of a kick to counter some of the fattiness of the bacon. As much as I enjoyed the bacon, I kept on thinking it tasted like ham lol yelp.com/user_local_phot…

Brisket- Honestly, I was shocked I didn't love their brisket. I was expecting this to be my favorite thing here, I felt the brisket was kinda dry and the texture was a little tough. This made me sad =( yelp.com/user_local_phot…

Collard Greens w. Smoked Pork Shoulder- This is kinda a necessity to add some vegetables in the meal. It's not really an exciting side, it was just OK, I wish they cooked the greens a bit more.

Texas Style Queso Mac & Cheese- This was kinda meh too, the sauce was really thick and the pasta was way overcooked.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"A brisk touch of the soul: true food for the barbecue lover with some twists

Having already waited an hr for Brooklyn Crab, we diverted our eyes to this Hometown neighbor that was also buzzing. Waited 30min on a late Saturday night, some of their stuff was out like lamb belly but they do seem to try to replenish if they can.

The brisket is the star of the show. 1/2 lb gets you about 1 thick slice of tender buttery deliciousness. Although I prefer my brisket a bit more smoky, this was spot on southern BBQ. You know it's quality when the leftovers eaten the next day are still so moist and succulent.

Ribs - good. Not exactly fall in love off the bone, but better than average.

Vietnamese hot wings are OK. You could go without it. Very forgettable. The ""ranch"" sauce is a huge mismatch.

Texas queso Mac and cheese is awesome. Usually I prefer more contrasting textures, but 5 stars for taste. Definite must get.

Collard greens - passing grade. Get it if you need your veggies to digest the carnivore splurge.

Corn bread - disappointing considering the great barbecue. I wouldn't get again unless you really want your cornbread. Side note: tastes better if you reheat over stove next day for it to caramelize.

I think what sets this joint back from full-on glory are their barbecue sauces. I'm really not impressed. I would choose other sauces if I could. Their hot and sweet sauce has good spicy profile (just a slight zing) but it doesn't elevate the food.

Bottom line: a taste of southern love in the north that I'm coming back for more (brisket, mac and cheese)!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"On a 1-5 scale Hometown is an 8. Seriously. No need to get cute with ordering... brisket and bacon x1000. That alone is worth the hour+ drive for me from Jersey. This place turned myself, my friends and my family into Barbecue people. Are you really still reading? What are you doing?' Jump on that line already. It's building up. And it doesn't matter how long that line is: it's worth it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Who would have thought that NYC would blossom into a BBQ haven in the good ol' US of A?! And among the plethora of options (Hill Country, Dinosaur, Fette Sau, Blue Smoke, etc.) that now reside within the 5 boroughs, the hype train has recently been around relative newcomer Hometown Bar-B-Que (est. 2013).

For the last year, it seems I couldn't avoid reading about Hometown as it had been topping every best of BBQ list in NYC that I laid my eyes on. I even caught them on an episode of DDD on the Food Network! We just had to check it out for ourselves.

Just a few blocks away from the Ikea in Red Hook is Hometown. You absolutely cannot miss it with it's big bold letters on its walls.We dropped in on a recent Friday evening at around 6:30pm and foot traffic was modest at the restaurant, which we were happy about. We were afraid the place would be packed with the hype around it. There was a steady stream of customers coming in and also seated. There were plenty of seats available in the main dining room and the adjacent one though.

The second we walked in, we saw the menu plastered on the wall to our left where the ordering line formed. As with many BBQ joints, there was no surprise with the typical brisket, pulled pork, ribs (beef, short) and sides. However, there were a few other new items that caught our eye, specifically, the Korean Sticky Wings, Lamb Belly and Jamaican Jerk Baby Back Ribs. Yeah I know, they all sound REAL good! After scanning thru the menu, probably like many, we wanted everything, but our wallets could only take us so far!

We ended up comprising (unfortunately) and ordering 2 strips of the brisket, 1/4 lb of the lamb belly, a half rack of the Jamaican Jerk Baby Back Ribs and 2 sides (Mac and Cheese and Smoked Pit Beans). We really wanted the sticky wings too, but ultimately went with the lamb belly. Just an FYI for everyone who is curious about what the minimum amount of meat a customer could order is. For the brisket, each cut is about 1/3 of a lb, which is the minimum. For the rest of the meat where the prices are by the 1/2 lb, they can be ordered by the 1/4 lb. Follow me?

So was it all worth it?

Three words: HELL FREAKIN' YEAH!

Everything was just on point and, even better than we anticipated! The brisket was so fatty, juicy and tasty. It had that nice black char to its skin. The lamb belly reminded us of pulled pork from BBQ spots, but juicier and flavorful. The Jamaican jerk baby back ribs were so tender and the meat fell right off the bone when ripping into it. One knock on them though was that I couldn't taste too much of the Jamaican spice, but they were still very good. The mac and cheese was excellent and the smoked pit beans were really unique. Although my fiance wasn't big on the beans, I loved them. They had a strong smoky flavor to them with bit-size burnt ends mixed in.

What else can I say? Just superb BBQ throughout. The counter service was friendly as well. We will definitely be back for the rest of the menu, including those Korean Sticky Wings!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Be prepared to wait! I was glad to know that going into it. It shouldn't be a deterrent... just go ready to have a drink or two before you order your food. There are two bars to order libations from, and a self serve water cooler - so chill out and make friends as you peruse the menu and continue to debate just how big your order will be. We opted to get an order of the vietnamese wings, the ribs, .5lb brisket, pulled pork sammie, chicken tacos, mac n cheese, whiskey pickles, and the corn bread. Nothing was bad. I'm partial to a pulled pork sandwich - and I started with that, so it was the standout for me. The mac n cheese and cornbread were both delicious. I did enjoy the chicken tacos - although it felt out of character. We had a lot of fun the entire time (even, and especially, on the line to get our food). The communal seating concept was cool - but we had no problem sitting our party of 3 at our own table. It would be cool if they had a yard! I'm sure I'll be back.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Second time coming here but we ordered almost every meat on the menu. Gotta say that this place is legit. I've been to Austin and know their bbq is out of this world but this place is the closest I've experienced while living in Ny. Meats are full of flavor and smoke, with the right amount of seasoning. Obviously the brisket is good and tender, and so are the beef ribs, but I think it all comes down to preference. I didn't try the chicken wings but heard they were pretty spicy. Pastrami style bacon was super thick. It came with a honey mustard type sauce which helped slice through the fatty/saltiness. I don't know if I would get this myself just because it's like eating a heart attack but I'm not gonna deny that it was good. The Korean sticky ribs was probably my favorite because of the sauce. Their house bbq sauce is also delicious though.

In terms of sides, I've had the mac n cheese, collard greens, and cornbread which are all solid and typical of a bbq joint. The cornbread has a light glaze so it's a little on the sweet side, which I prefer.

We came at 4 on a Friday and there was a very short line to order.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,"The only NY bbq I have had that genuinely is on par (if not better) with the top bbq joints in Texas, North Carolina and quite frankly the globe.

The brisket and lamb belly melts in your mouth, the wings are unbelievable, and the spare ribs are also must. There is also no better way to end a meal than the banana pudding (be sure to leave room).

The only watch out is the wait. This is not a well kept secret and attracts a lot of tourists, so be prepared for waits up to two hours.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants
Hometown Bar-B-Que,Such a LONG wait. We waited 2 hours. At the time we thought that it was worth the wait because the food was tasty.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Where do carnivores venture when they are ravenous? Hometown BBQ is ur spot. Be forewarned, you will have a long wait at this place (and only reason I'm giving it 4 and not 5 stars).

Came on a weekend (perhaps shorter wait in a weekday so there's that if u can make it) with 2 other people. Ordered beef ribs, pastrami bacon, brisket with Mac & cheese sides and corn bread. Legit all of the above was delicious. Honestly by the end all 3 of us were stuffed. Definitely enough food. Ok now to each meat:

1) pastrami bacon: do u like bacon and do u like salty rubbed bacon that's perfectly smokey? Yea? Get this!

2) brisket: a lot of pitfalls of BBQ spots is the dry or rubbery brisket. Not here! Imagine melt in ur mouth, perfectly rubbed brisket with just the right amt of fat. Now put that in ur mouth.

3) beef ribs: the most expensive on the menu a  30/lb. and even the smallest piece is usually greater than 1 lb. so be forewarned. Succulent and tender, juicy and explosive flavors. Absolutely delicious, but this is pricey and a lot of the weight is due to the bone.

Sides: Mac and cheese was nice and cheesy and pasta was cooked just right. Corn bread was moist, subtly sweet with a buttery finish. Both perfect complements to a fatty meal.

Environment is cafeteria style. U order in a long line at a counter and they give u the food on a tray. Attentive staff are quick to clear ur empty trays and bring u food that didn't get at the counter.

For manhattanites, come to red hook for the day, chill at breweries, go for a walk along the river, peruse IKEA if u dare and wait in line at hometown for the perfect dinner bf taking the ferry home.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"I apologize for using the word amazing more than once in this review but I cannot help it, the food here was amazing! My friend and I have been craving BBQ food for like 2 weeks and lucky for us I come across Hometown Bar-B-Que! I read about the line situation and hoping it wouldn't take us that long to eat and lucky for us it only took like 45 minutes. After we ordered our food was ready pretty quickly so I don't understand why it takes so long for the line to just move.

Anywho, we wanted to try just about everything on the menu but we scaled our order to the beef rib, brisket tacos, hot wings, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and the whiskey sour pickles. Let's indulge!

Beef ribs-Amazing! I did not know ribs could be that tender. It literally fell of the bone and it seasoned perfectly and so much meat! I ate it with the spicy and sweet sauce and that gave it even more of a kick. Just yum!

Brisket tacos-Not my favorite, unfortunately I was only able to get through a half of one. They were pretty dry and missing flavor.

Vietnamese hot wings-I'm in love with these chicken wings. They were amazing. The sauce was spicy and sweet and the garnishes enhanced the flavor-sooo good! Oh and the cilantro ranch was the perfect dipping sauce for these wings.

Macaroni & cheese-Very yummy, I was afraid it was going to taste like generic macaroni and cheese but they did their thing. It had the right amount of cheese and was seasoned well.

Whiskey sour pickles-My friend wanted these pickles so bad lol so we got them. They tasted like pickles to me but she loved them.

Coleslaw-I love coleslaw and this one did not disappoint. It tasted very fresh and their coleslaw had a bit of tanginess to it. Delicious. It was a good addition to our BBQ meal because it was so heavy.

This restaurant gets 4 and a half stars. I took off a half star because of the brisket tacos and its was kinda pricey here. However my friend and I did enjoy everything else we had. The decor of the restaurant was very cool and I liked the atmosphere.

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"New York is brimming with good BBQ choices. And out of those many options for good BBQ, Hometown BBQ is one of my favorites so far!

My friends and I planned a trip to Hometown a month in advance. We agreed to arrive around 12pm, because once they run out of BBQ, that's it. When we got there, the line already snaked to the door. The smell was dizzyingly aroma of smoked meats. Mmmmmm. We were like children in a candy store! My friend was jumping up and down, giddy with anticipation.

They serve the meats by the pound (except the beef rib which is sold per rib) and sides come in S, M or L. So much variety for your omnivore! We decided on lamb belly, one beef rib, brisket, pastrami bacon, mashed potatoes, queso mac and cheese, smoked pit beans, and whiskey sour pickles.

Food:
My absolute favorites were the pastrami bacon and the beef rib. The pastrami bacon was smoked, seared and had a crunchy char of pastrami spices that brought out the savory half fatty beef. And with that spicy sweet honey sauce! It was So amazing and unique! I could have eaten a half a pound by myself. (It's only two slices) And it was so much better than any thick cut bacon from a steakhouse!

The head-sized beef rib made me feel like I was a Flintstone character! Sold by the rib, this was the highest priced item that you weren't eating (most of the rib's weight is in the bone). But once you bit into this flavorful unctuous fall-off-the-bone meat, you realized this gigantic meat-on-bone was worth it! The juices and marrow from the roasted rib doused the meat around the bone with a rich fatty flavor.

Protip: Don't eat the pastrami bacon first. Because even though the other meats are delicious and well done, they pale in comparison to the bacon and beef rib.

The brisket was fatty flavorful; it had a beautiful smoke ring on the outer perimeter.
The lamb belly was a little sinewy, tough and gamey but maybe I waited too long to eat this.
Mashed potatoes had a touch of lemon and dill and was fantastic! I would definitely order this again. Whiskey sour pickles were a much needed contrast the the heavy meats we were consuming. The crunch, sourness and spice was a great reset while we were devouring brisket.
Smoked pit beans were smoky but needed a little kick. So the housemade hot sauce was perfect with the beans.

Ambience: I liked the band area, the wooden picnic tables, and white Christmas lights hanging from the ceiling. It felt like you were in someone's smokehouse.

I would definitely come back, order the pastrami bacon, beef rib, mashed potatoes and pickles again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Long Story Short: There aren't too many good, relatively authentic halal barbecue places, so for Muslims, this is a great place to get this kind of food. Is the 1.5 hour line plus the long way out to Red Hook worth the food? Debatable..

Long Story: I've been to Hometown twice, once from Uptown Manhattan via subway/bus and this most recent time via car. Although the trip out to Hometown the first time around was significantly longer, I felt that my experience the first time was actually better. We ordered brisket and potato salad, and the brisket was great-- juicy, fatty, everything you want out of good brisket. Potato salad was just okay. Their sauces are VERY good in my opinion. We came around 9:00 on a Saturday, so there was basically no line and no issue finding a table.

This most recent trip though really tested our patience. We came on a Saturday night (our first mistake), but we drove all the way out here this time, so we decided to stick it out and wait the full 1.5 hour line that seems to be typical (based on prior reviews) of a Saturday night. This time we were told that both the brisket and the beef ribs were sourced from Creekstone (a halal meat supplier), so we perked up knowing that we would be able to try both meats. We ordered both along with the Mac and cheese and the beans. The ribs were definitely better than the brisket this time. Do not underestimate how filling a 1/2 lb of meat is and over-order like we did!! Mac and cheese was good, but pretty typical, and beans were very strong in flavor, which I liked but may not be for all. The sides though are overpriced for their portion size. The line and issue finding a table to sit were honestly so ridiculous that if we were to come back, it would not be on a Saturday night. I would've given Hometown 3 stars just because of the massive hassle it is to get your food and eat comfortably, but because they offer halal authentic barbecue, they get an extra star for catering to people of different dietary restrictions.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hometown-bar-b-que-brooklyn-3?osq=restaurants

Hometown Bar-B-Que,"Ferry into Redhook from the new line that opened up further south in Brooklyn was a great way to kick off our adventure

Walking through the neighborhood there was a quaint charm that really captured a feel and time unlike what I have experienced in NYC

As for the food, you get in line and order the meats by the pound (no combo options). For beers, they have a separate section right when you walk in

Sausage - good snap, well seasoned +1
Brisket - good smoke, lacked seasoning, tender
Lamb Belly - not too gamey, moist, nice balance of heat/spices etc +1
Burnt Ends - solid
Pastrami Bacon - simply delicious, espcially paired with the mustard sauce! +1
Jamacian Spare Ribs - a huge let down, seasoning was bland and lacked a meaty depth
Mac & Cheese - all around good mac and cheese with no highs or lows
Collard Greens - pulled pork worked well with the greens
Corn Bread - good crusty exterior with a soft moist interior
Whiskey Pickles - good acidic kick to offset the heaviness of the meats (small is plenty) with a subtle whiskey punch

Plenty of seating all around but lines to form quickly and tables will disappear

They also have a band area so live music must happen here which would be great while noshing on some BBQ and beers

I came here for a date night with my boyfriend a few weeks ago and I have nothing but great things to say about this place!

I would say I'm not the biggest fan of French food however after trying this place out I would say I definitely would come back to try more from their menu... We didn't have any reservations which I wish we knew ahead of time because the wait was quite long but the service and attention we had from the waiter was impeccable!

We started off with some wine which was the reason we came and then we wanted to get something to nibble on since we were a bit hungry. For this reason, my boyfriend decided to order the escargot since I've never had it and the duck confit which I've had before but never at this restaurant. Both dishes were absolutely amazing and I would most definitely recommend them to anyone that comes to this place. The best part was that at the end we were given a small glass of wine on the house which I truly appreciated. Highly recommend, 5/5 for sure!

Amélie,"Overall, really liked Amelie but thought it was a bit overrated. We had a reservation for a Saturday night (would definitely suggest getting one in advance as seemed like most people had one through Yelp so may be quite difficult to get seated when it's busy without). We were seated around 15 minutes after our reservation.

They really pack this place - the table we were seated at probably had just around a foot of space between the tables so it was really cramped (really hard to get in and out w/ a winter jacket without bumping into people who were already seated). The ambiance is nice (dimly lit), but I couldn't really get over the lack of space. I felt like I had to keep my arms to myself the entire meal so that I didn't bump into the people next to me, and I could also hear their conversations.

I got the duck confit which would probably rate a 4/5. There just wasn't really anything special about it and it was a bit salty :/ It was not bad, but for the price point and for how popular this place is, I was a bit disappointed. We also got the mussels which were nice, especially if you have extra bread to dip.

Overall I would say Amelie is not bad, but not amazing. You probably won't have a bad date experience here, but it may be a hit or miss depending on how crowded it is.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I love Amelie! Just come early if you want to get a spot for happy hour, I've been turned away a lot (normally a 30+ min wait during happy hour) but the wine flights are worth it!

Happy hour is only in the standing room so it can be crowded and loud since its so popular- If you want to experience Amelie but don't want to risk not getting a table, try their Upper West Side location!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"Always love Amelie but the recent lunch visit was disappointing.
Lunch wine flight feel like become stingier pour compare to before.

Crab Crostini $16 - two pieces small but not bad

Steak $26 - two small pieces of steak this was indeed a joke.....",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"A fantastic find in Greenwich village for a post dinner celebration and late night snacky snack. We grabbed sushi in flatiron and headed to Amélie as we were still hungry after a 12 course omakase. We made a reservation for 9:30pm and arrived around an hour early however the waiter informed us a table would be cleared in 20min and we grabbed drinks (a Prosecco and red wine) at the bar while we waited. The wine was too dry for my taste but the Prosecco was tasty. The vibe is very energetic and noisy and there was a large crowd on a Saturday night when we visited as expected.

We were feeling adventurous and ordered the 5 item charcuterie board (I do not remember even remotely the names of all the items but it included 4 delicious meats and a semi soft cheese). We also ordered an escargot appetizer cooked in garlic buttery sauce goodness which was simply sublime, tender, rich with flavor and likely the best dish I've had in a really long time. I like that they provide refills of the bread for free however it was rather dry and honestly difficult to eat.

My only other gripe is that the restaurant is very dimly lit which Makes it difficult to see anything clearly. Overall the wait staff did a great job by checking in on orders and water refills at all the appropriate time intervals which was very much appreciated. The bill came out to around $90 for our entire order including tax and tip - it was obviously on the pricier side but that's the reality of European & new American cuisine and the main reason why I usually make this type of establishment a special occasion stop.

I would not mind returning in the near future for a second round of their charcuterie board and escargot appetizers though.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"This restaurant has been on my list for A WHILE, and I'm so glad I finally had the chance to go during happy hour. First of all, this restaurant is so intimate/cozy and therefore perfect for catching up with friends/if you're on a date.

The happy hour menu is amazing--love the wine flight deal for $12 and find it hilarious that they have men's names like ""Benjamin"" and ""Anthony."" The charcuterie board is also amazing, I LOVED the Brillat Savarin from Normandy, France--it tasted amazing spread on the baguette (speaking of which, my only qualm is that the baguette was too hard). I would highly recommend coming here for happy hour!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Highly recommend coming here!!! Also def make reservations because it's a small place and we came at 8pm on a Tuesday night and they were still very busy.
We got a nice table. They have so many wine options and the food menu is extensive. We got cauliflower appetizer and ugh i wish i could cauliflower like that!
Then we shared the 5 piece cheese and meat board. Plenty of cheese and meat and jam and mustard! And the bread is so fresh tasting!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"Tried this place for the first time & I plan on returning! My friend and I ordered the kale salad, roasted cauliflower, and the ravioli. All was very tasty and the serving size of the dishes, to us, exceeded our expectations. We barely finished because of how full we were! I'm hoping to return to try other dishes from the menu as the other pictures provided on Yelp look delicious.

We came to this establishment during what they call their ""Happier Hour"" which starts at 4pm and ends at 7pm. This allowed us to try their wine flights for $12. Each flight comes with 3 glasses and they had a good amount of selections to choose from!

Overall, food and drinks here are worth trying! The ambience of the place was also appreciated as it was not too loud & was set with low lights. The only reason why I could not give this place full 5 stars was because of crowding in seating. The person on my left and the person on my right might as well have joined my friend and I because they were so close. Our table was also very small so I had to be mindful of where I was shifting plates and glasses. I actually knocked over one of my wine glasses because of how cramped it was. The waiter was very gracious and immediately reassured me & cleaned it up!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"I've been to Amélie 3 times before tonight 1/26/20 and each time, I've not been disappointed. It can get pretty packed even on weeknights so be sure to make a reservation!

This place is great for a girls night out, or a small group celebration meal. Tables are small, space is quite tight. I was there when a big birthday  party was going on last Sunday. There was a photographer with a professional camera taking very bright flash photos, which wasn't very pleasant. But the food made up for it.
I think the wines here are of pretty great quality and always are served in large wine glasses, which is greatly appreciated by a diner like myself.

I highly recommended getting the burata for a starter and the steak for the main. Loved the chocolate lava cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream added on for dessert. Nice place in the Village for a cozy, intimate meal.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I am simply in love. This has become my new favorite go to French place, with a cherry on top: they use Creekstone beef! *halal alert*

Disclaimer : you gotta do this place right ! Tapa style and skip the entrees , load up on appetizers.

Oysters from Maine were fresh and perfect With the vinegar and lemon. The watermelon gazpacho was a little bit underwhelming especially after two nights of me dining at Mercado - the little Spain by Jose andres in Hudson yards . However, it held its own which is worth a lot. The warm glob of pistachio crusted goat cheese really stole the show here And honestly I felt like every subsequent dish one upped the previous one, Ultimately culminating in an explosion of delicious hot and cold delight. The molten lava cake was hands-down the best dessert I have had in the country. Add to that the fact that you can customize it with whatever gelato flavor and it comes in a swirl of strawberry and creme Anglais . I would give it a 6/5 for texture and flavor and temperate - all being optimized in one perfect desert.
The cappuccino as a pallet cleanser was also very good with the desset.

That said, the table next to us ordered mediocre creme brûlée and chocolate mousse and I would advise against both . .

The beef tartare , halal and perfectly ratioed was another winner . All the cheeses in general were winners. The burrata was solid but I'd give it a- 4/5 ( I've had better but only because I have traveled far and wide looking for burrata)

Definitely going back. Perfect ambience for a girls night out or a date. Happy hour prices make it affordable but the environment and service is amazing and worthy of three stars",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"- One of my favourite French restaurants in nyc
- Bread to start
- Small restaurant so you're sitting very close to your neighbor
- Live music to enjoy at the front near the entrance
- Dark, intimate feel
- Definitely recommend sitting at the bar and getting a wine flight
- One large table at the back for groups
- You'll definitely need reservations
- I've tried multiple items (onion soup, tuna tartare, duck confit) on the menu and everything was good
- There's a reason I keep coming back!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I feel like it is very difficult to find a good french restaurant in the US.  They are often overly fancy, excessively expensive, or just not that great.  I really enjoyed Amélie and thought the small plates were all really good and reasonably priced.  The restaurant was fairly small and crowded, but still felt intimate, great date spot.  Of course they have great, fresh french bread!

Foie Gras:  Really enjoyed the foie gras, probably my favorite dish.  It's so rich and creamy it tastes like butter.  Great combination with the sauce and apricots on toast.

Burrata:  The burrata was very good, tasted so fresh.  Huge ball of cheese goes well with the salad, oil, and herbs.  Great with the french bread.

Escargots:  Escargot is one of my favorite french dishes.  These were cooked well, but I was a little surprised how sweet they were.  However, I usually think of escargot as a garlic butter delivery device.

Fresh Oysters: I am always scared to get fresh oysters, but these were very fresh. Worth a try!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I was here for brunch within a party of 3 at 12pm on a cloudy and foggy Saturday. There was no wait list at the time and plus you can make reservation on Yelp. For a while this place has been on my to-go list and I'm so glad I finally made it.
The servers are all super friendly and never underestimate how much better your day would be if you start in a restaurant full of happy stuff. They are very patient in answering all my questions about the menu and they would also point out their favorite dishes which leaves me an easier job as I do get into trouble when there are too many selections.
Now, let's talk about food.
Duck confit: absolutely amazing. Crispy skin and tender meat with a little fatty tissues. The greens on the side is very fresh and goes quite nicely with the meat.
French toast: it's French toast and I like French toast. I don't think there's anything special about it.
Eggs: a very creative dish, or maybe I simply don't know enough dishes and maybe this is actually a classic. Purple eggs on the toast, served with slices of porks by some greens. First time I ever had it. It's an interesting dish.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"We will definitely come back!
The service was excellent!
The food is delicious!!
The Tuna Tartar is a must to order.
Excellent wine list and they allowed us first to enjoy a taste of each we chose before ordering.
Music is not so loud but definitely a chill out place to hang out for any occasion.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

With 80s decor.

Must get: goat cheese ball, escargot, mussels and fries.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I love this place so much.

First please note it's loud and depending on where you get seated it is cramped. Please make reservations or don't LOL but recommended you do.

I really feel like you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

I love their meat and cheese board, I can eat twenty of those.
The tuna tartare is fabulous, the tuna is fresh and not oversauced.
I love goat cheese so the goat cheese ball is a must for me.

the only dish I was iffy on was the beef tartare was a little too tomatoey tasting for me.

but honestly, if I could eat here every day I would.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Got my first wine flight here and I was not disappointed. The menu said it comes with 6 but the waiter said that it was for the happy hour which was clearly happy hour time when we went but I was happy with the 3 selections I got.

They give you bread.

I got the mussels and it was really good. I usually don't get seafood at restaurant but I made an exception and it did not let me down. Best part, if you dip the bread in the soup that the mussels come in, it tastes great! We love a good life hack. The wine tasted pretty similar, my friends were getting hints of smoke and cherry but I was getting wasted (or planned to). It also comes with French fries but not enough dip for them.

The service was great and the waiter was super friendly. I would come here again!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,Amélie is not only my favorite wine bar in the city but it's also my favorite happy hour deal. The bar has a lovely ambiance and it's great place to go on a date or catch up with a friend. The drink selection is really great and the owners are always adding new wines. The food here is also delicious - the different cheeses have a ton of flavors and the bread is always soft and warm. I'd recommend asking the staff what cheese they recommend with your wine because that does end up making a difference.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I'd heard about this place for years and can't believe it's taken me so long to try it out -- so glad I did! Easy to make a reservation, great service, reasonable prices, and outstanding food. A friend and I ordered the cantaloupe and prosciutto ""salad"", the grilled shrimp and corn croquette entree, and (the absolute best) cheese and charcuterie board I've ever had. And a wine sampler each (at $12 for what's basically 3 full glasses of wine, you really can't go wrong with the happy hour deals). Everything was perfect and I can't wait to return.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"This French wine bar is such a cozy spot, even during lunch.  Ventured  with a friend and we opted on shared plates and each tried the cauliflower soup that was amazingly delicious (veganized).  The pot of mussels was delicious, especially the sauce, great for dipping the perfectly baked french baguette.

Although we visited during lunch they offer happy hour (no one else has happy hour at 1pm).  We tried the wine flight samples which is a set of 4 wines (I chose all red bold wines) for a reasonable price.  Definitely take your time savoring the wines as they can sneak up on you but oh they were so good.

The wait staff was great, friendly and informative with questions we had.

I'd like to visit during dinner hours which offer a few menu items not available during lunch.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"We came for our anniversary dinner. I got the first Cabernet listed on the menu and my boyfriend got an old fashioned. Neither of us really liked our drinks, but I guess that's what we get when we get the cheapest Cabernet and whiskey at a wine bar ‍

We got a charcuterie board to start with goat cheese, chorizo, and prosciutto. It was pretty delicious; I think the goat cheese + jam on the baguette was my favorite thing. The best thing we had was the lamb burger. We ordered it medium rare and the juices were dripping out of it. It was sooooo good. We also got the steak frite, which was also pretty good, but not as good as the burger. Fries were ok.

It's pretty loud and tight in the restaurant, so it certainly wasn't the most romantic setting. I'd come back, but not for a special occasion. The happy hour wine flight looked good, so it might be something nice to try if we come back and sit at the bar.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"5 stars for the drinks and 3 stars for the eats.

The wine special on happy hour can't be beat. For $12 you can choose a wine flight that comes with three hefty pours. It's basically like three glasses of wine. This is considered a steal anywhere, making it even better in the West Village. There are a ton of different flights to choose from. I went with the Jacques which had three full smooth reds - all were incredible!

There are also a few small plates on special, and then a larger menu with more food selection. Most things on the menu don't have meat on them and are very cheese focused. Maybe I'm just picky, but I would have appreciated to see some more mainstream items. I just can't get down on escargot and pate. We went with Brussels sprouts, baked camembert with honey and a charcuterie plate with chorizo, sopressata and manchego.

The Brussels definitely stole the show. The portion was pretty large and topped with thick pieces of bacon. The camembert was really disappointing. We were expecting a baked brie but this was like a weird coagulated pot of hot cheese. Not about it. The charcuterie was decent, the plate came with a ton of extras like pickles, figs, grapes, nuts and a few spreads. I just wish the cheese portion was a little less skimpy, but I will probably always feel that way.

It's super stuffy inside and tables are very close together, but it's also an intimate wine bar. Just a heads up. It got very hot in there.

I'd return for a happy hour drink and then would probably opt to have dinner elsewhere in the village. Can't go wrong with that though!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I'm such a wine snob, so when I was told to try this place out I was very excited! They have a pretty good selection of wines, enough to keep you busy, but it wasn't jaw dropping. I also had the cheese and charcuterie board with the comte and the jambon. I really enjoyed them both! I ate until I couldn't anymore.

The atmosphere was nice, definitely better with a companion. There was a ton of space which was a little surprising to me since it's in the heart of Manhattan. It did have a very French feel to the place, which I enjoyed for the most part. But if you're expecting some southern hospitality, this place ain't it!

Definitely wanna go back and try some more of their wines! Maybe bring a friend or two so we can have a selection.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"review for brunch (the second review i've written for brunch today, though i'm not even a fan of brunch...).

i made a reservation for around 1:30 pm on a sunday, and was pleasantly surprised to observe when i arrived that we probably could've just walked in. while we waited to order, i overheard the table next to us talking about how they loved brunch at this other restaurant, but ended up at amelie again because they couldn't make reservations there and hadn't wanted to wait, lol. however, they appeared to have been pretty familiar with the menu so that gave me hope for the food...

the area right by the window was a little cramped - the table is small, even for me, so that the servers had to leave bottles of water leaning on a ledge against the wall between tables. i shudder at the thought of what would have happened if we had also ordered drinks, as is pretty common for brunch, and added more tableware to our limited space. so maybe for this reason, they brought out what we ordered one at a time:

1. first, the pistachio crusted goat cheese ball really earns its praise. you can't really go wrong with a ball of honey and cheese, i think, but the onions that it rests on are also honeyed and sweetly caramelised, carrying all these other flavors. just delicious. neither i nor my friend could really taste the pistachio, particularly because the goat cheese and honey are so strong on their own, but that didn't necessarily affect our enjoyment of it. note that you get refills of the sack of baguettes, so try to slow down once you've inevitably finished the basket and wait until you get more. or you can just eat the cheese by itself, as we did. you can't go wrong either way.

2. next, the eggs meurette. my friend and i are fans of anything soaked in red wine, and this was no exception. however, if the onions were the dark horse of the appetizer, i think the salad was the breakout star here LOL. it was bright and citrusy and broke up the eggs, which got heavy and one-note after a while. i finished it to the last sprig. i think without the accompanying greens i wouldn't have really been a fan of this (it was good, just not great) and would probably recommend trying something else instead.

3. the last was the gratin de ravioles du royans (not pictured; sorry!). the dish was very cheesy and rich, and the small raviolis were pretty good. however, i think it sorely needed a counterpart (like the salad with the eggs) to keep things interesting. if the tables had been a bit bigger and the dishes all brought out at once, i think the goat cheese ball would have been a wonderful side to bring some sweetness and variety to gratin (or even the eggs).

maybe like the table next to us you will come to amelie as your back up, but i think it's a safe choice. the dishes were, for the most part, on point, and prices were fair for the portion size. ultimately, i believe that the meal would have benefited from everything coming out at once and a bit more variety in how everything tastes. but good enough that when a friend asked for brunch recommendations recently, amelie drifted to mind.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"So I'm a sucker for French bistro style food and there's lots of that genre to choose from in the City. Amelie is not quite a left bank Parisian bistro -- but when in the West Village on 8th street -- it will do.

This eatery gets high marks on Yelp -- so we took a leap of faith and chose it for brunch with our out of town friends.

Overall I am pleased with the food. Not so much with the brusque service, the impossibly loud music and the endless chatter from a packed house. Conversation required yelling at one another like carny barkers -- not an ideal vibe for a relaxing Saturday brunch with friends.

The best bite (we shared two servings) was escargots served shelled in classic parsley/garlic/butter gratinee. These tender globules were perfectly seasoned and melt in your mouth tender. Mop with the gratis crusty baguettes -- sip some wine -- think Burgundy France -- and you may forget how deafening this joint really is.

My duck leg confit was classically prepared -- perfectly tender and flavorful -- but the soggy and flavorless potato slices served with the duck marred the dish and the presentation.

Mussels in wine with leek were very pedestrian -- several were unopened (as in old and dead) which is always mildly distressing. The lamb burger, while nicely charred to chef recommended medium, was served on a toasted baguette instead of a brioche bun (as advertised). Our server said they ran out of buns and suggested the baguette would work even better. It didn't. Made for gum tearing and teeth rattling chewing. Toasted baguettes work with onion soup or as salad croutons, not as vessels for tender lamb burgers.

Hanger steak, frites and eggs was an honest interpretation; the shoestring frites were perfectly crispy and the meal is served with a trio of flavorful sauces.  

The charcuterie and cheese platter (choice of 5 for $33 bucks) was very satisfying -- and in this instance -- a crusty baguette was a perfect match. I especially liked the pheasant pate and duck rilette alongside stinky French cheeses. Great contrasts in flavor. Wish they had more selections.

Amelie offers plenty of choice in drinks though, including some very nice house special cocktails. My two absinthe and rye whiskey powered Sazerac's were delicious and reminded me of how much I missed this classic south of France combo. Everyone else quaffed good French wine by the glass and seemed happy with their choices.

Top Tip: The brunch menu is limited, but the happy hour with $12 wine flights supported by a full dinner menu runs from 4 to 7. We just missed this special.

Next trip I look forward to trying the regular dinner menu and more absinthe inspired cocktails. Who knows. If I don't lop off my ear, I might just be inspired enough to paint like Vincent, in a wormwood induced -- green fairy-like haze. Lol",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,Amazing service. We were 3 friends celebrating our 40th birthdays there in January and had the best time. They even remembered that we were celebrating and gave up some free champs fo make the occasion special. Thank you!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"This place has pretty cool vibes, as well as several French speakers on staff!

However, I would probably come back in the earlier in the evening, when the sun is still out, because the interior is so dark that I could barely see! (Plus, they have $12 wine flights during HH) Also, it's a bit cozier than I expected and can get very crowded.

My Burgundy Escargots Gratinés and Hudson Valley Duck Leg Confit were pretty good - not the best, but better than average among versions I've had previously. My friend really enjoyed the Brandade (salt cod/creamy potato dish), but she was disappointed to find her Gratin de Ravioles du Royans to be over-baked (to a mush) and flavorless.

The chocolate mousse dessert was also a bit underwhelming. I think I would just come back for wine and appetizers next time.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"We came here for a birthday dinner and it was well enjoyed. We started with a few drinks and some mussels, these were insanely tasty and the bread that accompanied it was even better. The perfect dip was indeed the fresh bread provided and the broth from the mussels. My boyfriend had the duck confit and I had the ravioli dish, he raved about the duck so I'm thinking this may be their best entree there. The ravioli was okay but nothing I would order again or continue raving about. Make sure to make a reservation for this location and they seem to be quite crowded on weekends.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Love love the ambiance here and how they have a good selection of seafood and unique French foods. There are a lot of people so we had to wait a bit. Server was kind and attentive. The thing is, I wish that French restaurants give bigger portions and dial it back on the seasoning and sauce because after eating this small plate, I was not hungry for the entire day. Must have been drenched in seasoning, sauce, oil, butter, etc. However, it was still delicious. Great selection of desserts too! Love the location too so might be back if I am in the area.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"I came to Amélie with a friend for lunch. The restaurant had a nice vibe, with enough seating to not feel tight and still feel intimate (the tables are pretty close, though).

My lamb burger was solid. Not mind blowing, but it was cooked properly at medium and came with good fries and a green salad. My friend had the French Toast, which is accompanied with mixed fruit and whipped cream, and said it was first rate.

The decor is quirky for sure --there is a light fixture with money and handwritten notes hanging from it. Not sure how that is French, but somehow it works, given the other quirky design elements like the porthole windows in the door that leads to the bathroom to the hallway.

Service was fairly good as well.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Amelie has been on my go-to list for about a year now. I don't know why I visited this place now. It exceeded my expectations!
My friend and I visited on a Saturday night at around 8 pm. It was very busy and loud. It looked like people were pregaming with wine before their main events. We were seated fast because I made a reservation beforehand. I would recommend making the reservation a couple of days earlier because it gets filled fast!
My friend and I ate the goat cheese ball and escargot with a bottle of Italian white wine. We only ordered the appetizers, not wanting to have a heavy dinner. The sauce for the escargot was delicious. We scraped off every bit of it with bread. We scraped off every bit of the goat cheese ball, too. It was very nutty and fruity.
The servers were all very attentive and nice. However, I do want to point out that there was little table space.
I am definitely coming back with my boyfriend soon! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a romantic night.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

I had the Olivier - dry mineral whites, and enjoyed all three.  The small plates are also good; the favorite being the warm pistachio crusted goat cheese ball.  The tricky part is trying to nab a seat as its a popular spot.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"My fiancé and I came here for brunch this past Sunday at noon. Not sure if it was still too early or the rainy weather, but it was empty. When we walked in another group was already eating and that's it.
Overall, service was good and so was the food. But I did not find it to be anything out of the ordinary from any other regular brunch place.
We ordered a cheese and charcuterie plate with two cheeses and one meat to start and my fiancé ordered a french onion soup. He judges places we go to based on how good their french onion soup is and he really did enjoy the one here! For our entrees we both ordered a lamb burger and a mimosa each.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Really enjoyed the food and drink here!! I was absolutely sold on a wine flight, 3 small glasses for $16. And loved trying new ones. The charcuterie board and mass amounts of bread will always win my heart. I had the Steak Aux Échalottes. Cooked perfectly and came with a literal brick size of potato gratin.

When we walked in, we didn't have reservations. I know it was a Saturday night but I did feel like the host was brushing us off and not that polite. Also our waiter accidentally charged us for FIVE wine flights instead of two. We didn't realize until after he charged us. Also thought it was strange when we put two cards down, we sort of assumed he would split it down the middle unless we specified. He split it really randomly like 70/30. Luckily we told him and he fixed it. But I was just generally confused by the logic there. Regardless I had a great time there.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"My girlfriend and I came here for a tasty french dinner on our last day of the winter together. It was a lot louder than we had expected, in fact I don't think I've ever been to a French restaurant as loud as this (we visited on a Thursday, which my girlfriend tells me is a big day out for New Yorkers). Resultantly, the employee I spoke to on the phone had a very difficult time hearing me and my attempts to make a reservation.

When we arrived, we were seated in a pretty dimly lit room with rather odd mid-century modern decor. The candles on the tables were fake. It was very loud and the waiter struggled to talk to us and hear our orders. Free bread and water as expected, and frequent waiters to take drink and food orders. The French onion soup was very very cheesy, but the broth itself was scrumptious and the bread accompanied it very well. The staff were happy to swap the potato gratinee for fries with my peppercorn hanger steak entrée, and the fries and sauce were nice and the steak was on the rarer side which I enjoyed, but the flavour of the steak itself felt a little lacking and we both had to ask for salt. The roasted duck leg confit was apparently very juicy and nice, as was the goats cheese starter.

House wine was an alright price for NY but it felt clear that coming during the happy hour was the way to go as far as the drinks are concerned. Maybe this is more of a drinks first, food second type of place that we would've enjoyed if we'd gone to drink a lot of different types of wine. Generally though, the food was nice, the atmosphere was kind of lacking and the drinks I can't complain about.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"LATE NIGHT FRENCH

Probably best known for their thousands of reviews and late kitchen ordering times

OYSTERS
Yum

COQ AU VIN
Eh. I've had better. But a sexy dish indeed

WINE & COGNAC
Great wine and liquor selection. Armagnac Laubade 1981 featured.

OVERALL
Possibly another restaurant that had dipped in quality due to yelp fame, but you can't beat that late kitchen time. Au revoir Amelie",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"This was my second time I visited the place. They were nice about letting us sit early before our reservation time. What failed this time was the service. The guy that sat me down initially didnt seem happy to wait on me. A bit disappointed since I was having a early birthday dinner. One less star. However, the food was still good. They have the best chicken liver pate & beef tartare. Their foie gra seems to be better the first time (2 years ago). The escargot was good in it's own way. Just a warning, its not cooked in the traditional garlic butter. It has parsley and on the sweet end. My party had the mussels and liked it. Hopefully, the next time it would be more of a 5 star experience.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I made a reservation here for two people on Friday for later that night, and when we arrived we were seated without a problem. The interior was much more modern and trendy than I thought it would be, but in a good way. It was also completely full on a Friday night. Since it was so crowded, the service was a little slow but we weren't in any rush.

We decided to order wine flights, which were only $16 and came with three small but almost full glasses of wine. They have 8 different wine flights to choose from, and we decided to try the Eric and Benjamin. We liked most of the types of wine that they brought us! For dinner, we both ordered steak tartare, which they have both a 5 oz and 8 oz portion of. We also ordered the fries and brussel sprouts to share. The steak tartare was delicious and prepared perfectly, with a quail egg on top. It also came with a fresh watercress salad on the side. The fries were also thin and delicious, with a side of mayo as well as a spicy mayo. The brussel sprouts were good but not my favorite, but that is mostly because I prefer when they are crispy rather the more soft ones. Every table also gets a cute sad of fresh bread (baguette).

By the end of our meal we were very full and happy. We really enjoyed our meal here, and it was less pricey than a lot of NYC restaurants of lower quality. We will be coming back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Amélie is one of the best French restaurants that I have been to. And below you will read why.

Walking in you come into a strong vibe. Lots of people enjoying themselves. Cool music, mouth watering food aromas, and amazing staff all about. We have been to Amélie a couple of times now but since Michael was in town we decided to bring him to see what all the fuss is about.

First we ordered the:

Hand cut creek stone beef tartare
Burgundy escargot
Hudson called fois gras
Half a dozen oysters

I've had everything listed above except for the tartare. And it was amazing. The beef was so silky and the  vinaigrette was very tangy but it was spot on with the taste of the beef.

Everything else's listed above was just as delicious as I had known before.  

Now for the next course:

Hudson called duck leg confit
Steak aux Échalottes
Le Coq au Vin

I've had the duck and it's amazing. The streak was perfect as well. BUT. The Le Coq au Vin, I could eat that everyday for the rest of my life. It was incredible. Absolutely incredible. The red wine sauce was very rich and bold. The pearl onions were crisp but still delicate. Bravo!!!

Now for dessert:

We had the creme brûlée and the chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream. I wish I could of just slept there. Then wake up in the middle of the night to eat everything again.

Bravo Amélie!!!!!!

We will absolutely, without a doubt be back!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"We will be back again and again - we just had the most marvelous meal with a scrumptious Rose bottle to boot.

The cheese plate is divine with high caliber cheese from an assortment of animal milks. My partner loved the croquettes of the day and escargot. The frisee salad with poached eggs and asparagus were my delicious endeavor. The aioli looked homemade and rich in flavor .

Lastly but the most important in this review is the service, the team taking care of us were on top of things, pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable about their menu .They took marvelous care, booked our table for a few weeks out and made the dinner better through their care without ever interrupting.

I not only am a huge advocate of theirs but I will regularly return and absolutely use this as a quality restaurant to bring parents to when they visit .

Absolutely go - I think you'll be hard pressed not to fall as head over heels as we did!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Great service, great wine, even better food! Went with a friend for happy hour on a weekday and it was packed. The Mac and Cheese was easily our favorite entree there. Would recommend getting a wine flight to try the different options available at the bar.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"This place is my go-to cozy french spot when I want to catch up with a friend. The interior is quaint and it can get a little cramped (tiny tables), but I guess that's part of the charm? The wine flights are so great because you can customize them from their extensive wine list. I've had the escargot, cheese plate, and the goat cheese ball, all of which are amazing. The escargot sauce is so good that I wish i just had a bowl of it to keep dipping the bread into. Oh yeah, they give you literal bags of bread so get ready to carb up. I'd recommend getting a reservation as it gets pretty crowded.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Very busy place near west village. We came at around the happy hour time, such a bustling crowd during that time! The restaurant's color is all red theme, very nice for friends hanging out after work.

All the dishes are fantastic taste. The oyster is fresh, my friend and I even wanted to order one more dish. The trout was so soft and melting, they have grabbed the essence of French so well. The crab tartare is beyond amazing.

The bar at the other side, always busy but energetic. Love this French red theme place.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"It's a cozy spot for catching up with girlfriends or just a simple day date. First off, we were greeted by a friendly staff and were accomodated even if we had come earlier than our reservation time.
Secondly, service was fast and great. Our questions were entertained and suggestions were given.
And of course, the food was amazing. The choices on the menu were limited but we went there to catch up and have some wine which by the way was so cool because they have a wine flight options. We had 3 different small but decent glasses of wine.
Overall, it was a nice dining experience for my friends and I. Would definitely come back to try the rest of the food  and wine.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"We had made reservations for a Sunday brunch (11:30 am) and the place wasn't busy at all. We were seated right away and ordered a bottle of Malbec for the table.

We placed our order which included a few omelettes and I got the Amélie Lamb Burger ($16) with lettuce wrap. Service was quick and food arrived within 20 mins.

Service quality itself wasn't that great. The French speaking staff especially needs some lessons on hospitality. No one checked with us if everything was ok and to our liking. We wanted some hot sauce but no one was paying attention and didn't bother coming to our table in spite if signaling a few servers.

Also, when we called for check, they charged us for home fries which was clearly included with omelettes. When we flagged this error, again, the French speaking staff said, that they are not included. Finally, the nice gentleman who was at the bar corrected this error and even apologized for this error. Kind man.

Food was ok.. the Lamb Burger had no salt (and guess what, salt wasn't on the table either)! So yeah, felt and looked like very authentic French place!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Love this spot, great wine bar with nice selections by the glass. The staff is smiling which is always a plus and service was attentive. This is my second time here but will def be coming around more often. The 2010 Bordeaux by the glass can't recall the name but was so smooth definitely a must try! Crowd is fun,mostly couples haha",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Happy hour prices before 7pm everyday.
Wine flight for $12 was excellent value. They have 8 different pre-selected wine flights but you can customize your own as well.

Free bread. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Only comes with butter, which was fine by me.

French onion soup - not many places serve French onion soup so I was happy to see this on the menu. It was quite expensive at $12, but I was craving it.

Dimly lit ambiance, so it's good for a date as well. What better way to spend the night than drinking wine.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I was in the area today and looked on yelp for a good lunch spot, landed here... and was very impressed!

I only got the chicken sandwich, as did my husband. So, we didn't try much but both thought it was really good! I went no mayo and that was the right call since there was already cheese and avocado on it. The bread was delicious and I thought the ratio of all the toppings/fixings to chicken was spot on!
The side of greens wasn't anything special although I have this feeling that the fries would have been really good.

Can't wait to go back and do wine flight(s), plus they also had a mimosa deal",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"We loved our time at Amelie! The servers were fantastic and kind, the ambiance clean and comfortable, and the food/drinks were out of this world.

Food:

* Chicken Liver Mousse - large amount for two people, could be shared amongst 4-5 people. Absolutely delicious! We plan on coming back solely for this dish. Served with a sliced baguette, mustard, pickles, carrots.

* Smoked Salmon Benedict - a perfect shareable for two people. The dish was made to perfection. The breakfast potatoes at the bottom of the dish were a nice addition.

We'll be back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I really like Amelie! When there's always a line outside of the door, you know the food is good. The food is spot on here if you're looking for French cuisine. I would recommend ordering the charcuterie plate, mussels, tuna tartar and oysters. The thing that I love about this place is that they also don't cheap out on bread. If you need more bread for dipping, they'll happily give you more! The wine flights are also a lot of fun if you're indecisive about what type to order. The restaurant itself is fairly crammed so you might be bumping elbows with a stranger sitting next to you.

Amélie,"It is not easy to find a good HH spot especially on the weekends, but Amelie got your back! They have HH EVERYDAY from 4-7pm, and their HH menu is pretty amazing too. Wine flight (3 half glasses of wine) cost $12 (you can customize other than what they have on the menu as well), Escargot is only $10, Shishido peppers and goat cheese ball were all so amazing. My husband and I stopped by before our dinner, but ended up being so full because we couldn't stop ordering and drinking. Lol For wine flight, I ordered Anthony (white wine; Rollie was really good), Rose, then customized my last one with champagne. Highly recommended and would love to return soon to try their dinner menu. One last thing, their staff members at the bar were very friendly!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Restaurant français spectaculaire!

We called about 15 min ahead and luckily got a table reserved for the 4 of us. Although small, the restaurant is beautiful inside with its dark red lighting, sleek decor, and wine bar on display. We were seated at one of the high tables, which made our legs a bit uncomfortable because of the lack of space. However, we were so grateful for not having to wait at all for a table on a busy Friday evening at such a popular place.

We started off with the 5 item charcuterie board, a wine flight, and the complimentary baguette. Everything on the board was delectable and the baguette had that perfect crunch on the outside while being soft on the inside. Our entrées came not long after, and were absolutely mouth-watering. The salmon was seared to perfection with a delicious beurre blanc sauce.

Mon Dieu! Such a lovely experience with excellent food.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Love this place. Initially stopped by for brunch and enjoyed it so much, we came back for dinner at a separate time. Ordered the Charcuterie board - try the duck breast.. enjoyed it a lot more than i would've thought. Pan seared cod - buttery and just the right amount of tartness. Partner ordered the duck leg confit - very pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Also enjoyed the wine flight when we stopped by for dinner.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I highly recommend you to try goat cheese ball!!

This is my go to place in NYC. I lost counts of how many time I have been here.
Great wine options and the staffs always give you great recommendations. They have great appetizers.
This place is for any occasion.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"It was my first time here visiting from LA and it was totally worth it!  Amelie has been on my Yelp list since it was recommended to me from a friend and it had impressive reviews on Yelp.  I made reservations over a month ago for 11 guests (including me) on a Saturday at 8pm.  Because there were over 10 people in my party, we had to have the prix fixe menu which includes an appetizer, main entrée, dessert, and drink (house wine, beer, or soft drink)--all for a great price of $60 (pre tax and gratuity). Not a lot of places even include drinks in their prix fixe menu. The place was packed and a bit noisy which I expected.  The ambiance had a nice, cool, casual vibe with red backlight.  We were seated in the back which was nice so we had a bit of distance from the front crowd.  From the prix fixe menu I got the following:

BURGUNDY ESCARGOTS GRATINES - the vegetable brunoise sauce gave it a yummy umami flavor! The escargot was nice and moist and I love the garlic parsley butter.  One of the best escargots I've tasted!

CRAB TARTINE (my friend's pick) - good but not as great as the escargot.  The pickled jalapeno gave it a nice kick and the citrus aioli was nice and creamy.  I actually tried pickled jalapeno with my escargot and it was delicious.

SEARED ORGANIC SALMON - cooked medium and it was delicious! The salmon was nice and moist on the inside with a perfect contrast of crispy skin on the outside.  The delicata squash underneath gave the dish a nice texture and acidic flavor.  Well done!

VANILLA BEAN CRÈME BRULEE - Yummy! Nothing fancy or deconstructed, just yummy crème brulee with nice caramelization.

SAUVIGNON BLANC - Light, refreshing, and smooth! Just the way I like it!

Such a great place for our last GNO in New York!  I would have to say the food here is way better than at Beauty & Essex and the price more reasonable. The food was delicious, the service was great, and Benjamin, our host, was warm and welcoming. Eric K, our server, was courteous and attentive.

I totally recommend this place for a great night out for dinner and drinks whether it's for a birthday, date night, or NYC This Is 40 Girls Trip like us!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Came here Friday night for a romantic anniversary dinner. So glad I made reservations via yelp because the restaurant is narrow so if there's a line, you end up waiting outside in the cold. Great happy hour specials on wine, until 7pm. 3 glasses of wines for $13 (given they're not full sized wine glasses but still a great deal! You can even mix and match to get different kinds of wine or share with your friends if you can't finish all 3 by yourself. I'm not judging.

The service was a bit slow because it was fully packed. Great place for a girls night out or anniversary dinner. Dim light, cool looking décor, moderate noise level. I ended up picking this place because I was looking to get some yummy escargot!

We started with some appetizers, escargot, smoke salmon crostini, octopus crostini, and crab tartine. My favorite out of the appetizers was octopus crostini, who knew I liked octopus? BUT beware, the bread for the crostini was super hard. I know it's not supposed to be soft like white bread, so that it can keep hold of the ingredients on top but this is another level of hard. Literally used a fork and knife to try to cut it in half and was struggling! Felt like I was about to chip a tooth trying to take my first bite. Escargot was a bit disappointing. Tasted like butter and not much else. BUT I'll admit I love to dip bread into all the escargot butter! The highlight of the meal had to be our entrée, the duck leg! Tender and flavorful. All in all, it was okay. I came for the escargot but came out liking the duck leg instead.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Visited Amelie back in Fall. The place had a ambiance. Service was good.
They had good cured meats
Good overall experience!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"BEST FRIES IN NYC. They are what I wish fast food fries tasted like growing up. We ordered another round because they were so delicious. Will be back for that for sure.
PROS: We got a table without a reservation. The service was prompt. The food was delicious.
CONS: It was hard to hear my friends at the table and I walked out with a tired voice. The seating was tight and we were disturbing our neighbors when we had to use the bathroom. We know restaurants are small in Village so it was fine--we just had to move both our table and our neighbors to get in and out.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Came here yesterday for happy hour. We sat at the bar because apparently if you don't have reservations you don't get a seat. Which I almost totally get because there where people in there sitting, talking, drinking and just enjoying themselves for over 2 hours (I was there for about 2 hours), without the feeling of being rushed.

Bar is a bit of a tight squeeze, if they could remove one stool it would be the perfect ""personal"" space amount. First batch for wine flights we ordered the dry white flight (forgot the name), and the rosé one which was called the Fabio. There was a mix up and ended up getting a sweet white one, which my friend decided to keep. The second round we both had the Fabio flight, it was good, I prefer the dry white. There might have been some more after that.

Onto food. We ordered some crostini's (Salmon and Octopus), the warm goat cheese ball and the escargots. The crostini's were delicious! The goat cheese ball might have been my favorite app. The escargot were good but needed a small pinch of salt. Also included was a bag of delicious bread, this is coming from someone who isn't really into bread. Entree we both ordered the duck (something we didn't need) the duck was delicious the potatoes and mushroom it laid on again could have used just a pinch of salt. But overall I enjoyed the food and would recommend this place and would come back.

Seating at the bar, for over 1.5 hours, the stool can get a bit uncomfortable. Just keep that in mind. The place is cute, atmosphere is just a ""vibe"" super chill, chic but inviting.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I can definitely say that everything here was absolutely amazing - wine, food and service!!!  We were in NY for my birthday weekend and wanted to come here again!  We made a reservation and were promptly seated on a Saturday night - it was bustling but everything came out without a hitch!  We ordered a bottle of wine and some charcuterie and chicken liver to go with it.  The chicken liver here is to die for!!!  Because I'm obsessed with all things duck, I got the duck confit.  It was perfectly prepared.  Not dry at all.  Absolutely delicious!  My husband got the steak frites.  Perfectly cooked medium rare and yummy frites!  There was a little wine left over so we opted for the chocolate mousse.  It was a perfect pairing.  Again, everything about the evening was awesome - including the service.  This is staying on my short list for my next NY trip!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I found this gem on yelp! It was pouring rain and I told the cabbie to take up to Grenache Village. He said ""I need an exact location""! Rookie!!! Anyway, I jumped on yelp and found Amelie. It had great ratings so we went for it.

And we are glad we did!

The whole staff is authentically French which  was a total bonus. The wine list was superb and our food was great! We had the madam croquette which was very FRENCH! It hard to get a real o e in the US. We also has a  charcuterie board! And, of course it was off the hook! We loved the ambiance and were super excited to stumble across an authentic French restaurant!

My only complaint was... it was a little cold in there. But, I just wore my jacket. No biggie!

Thanks Amelie!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"We looked for a place for brunch in the West Village, we call a friend and he suggested Amelle.
Maybe I should not ask him again  (to late).
So, lets see the coffee is so so bad and when we ask, Do you have a coffee machine in here?, they replay yes but you cannot see it its under the Bar ( funny ).
I order Nicoise salad, did not like it at all.
Service was not a service
Prices outrageous for what you get
Over all this you are seating is a restaurant and have a cold breeze like you are out ( not good)
I will never go again definitely will not recomend it.

Next time I should go with my gut feeling never fails me",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Escargot here. Do it. Also their patê, which we annihilated. Also don't overlook their crunchy vibrant acidic pickled veggies!

Ordered a flight of wine, escargot (w crispy bread), duck liver patê.... alongside their $30 ""pick any five"" charcuterie and cheese board. The blue cheese knocked our socks off. What a serious mouthgasm. All of it. Fuck yeah.

Amélie,"Walking by as Amelie is in our neighborhood, but with dinner waiting at home, we were arrested by the idea of watermelon gazpacho, so we ordered it to take home.  We received a container, clearly made to our order, of the most delicious and different watermelon gazpacho I have ever had.  It came with a generous portion of bread, and while such a tiny order is hardly the basis for a full review, we were treated so graciously and this was so wonderful that we cannot wait to go back !",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Wonderful escargot, duck confit crispy and just salty enough. Brussels sprouts! Just a wonderful meal. The only issue was the level of noise. Wow it was loud when we arrived.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"UPDATE - I just checked my bank acc and the bartender put in more tip than I intially did
One stars for my past experiences only. The rudest human being on earth - the bartender that night Salvatore. I wasnt greeted he just put the menues in front of me. I have been here a couple of times but never got a flight of wine so i ask for 3 different ones and he ironcally says ""so you want 9 glasses of wine right"". He only gave me water when my male friend joined me - so apperantley this guy is a sexist.
I just cant get over how distressing my experience was especially in one of my go to restaurants.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Wow. Just wow. Superb service, quality of food, ambience, crowd. I just loved everything about this swank French restaurant.

My husband and I came here for date night and we lucked out as there was instant seating at the bar tables. Usually there's reservations only or long wait time. tip: get reservations ahead of time or have an early dinner :)

We stared with escargot  oh my god these are to die for. Then we each had duck confit and wow this was one of the best confit I had. Super moist duck with a light a crispy skin. Wow just wow. I finished my meal with Prosecco and my husband with his whiskey. This was after all a whiskey and Prosecco kind of night

Def recommend this place!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Wow this place was absolutely amazing. Was seated quickly at the bar even though it was packed. The bartender and waiters were all very nice and attentive.

Mussels were great the sauce they were made with was so flavorful and mussels were plentiful. Even after all the mussels were gone, dipping the bread into the sauce was satisfying and delicious.

The duck was to die for. Meat was flavorful and basically fell off the bone.

The overall vibe of the place was relaxed and cozy but not too loud which was good. A good place to have a nice dinner and catch up with friends or for a casual date",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I came here with a friend for brunch right when they opened- so thankfully, no wait :)

I've heard a lot of great things about this spot for their dinners so we were curious to see if their brunch was any good. We wanted a light brunch and this spot had a good balance of dishes that were both light and hearty. The inside is fairly big, they take reservations- which is always a plus in NYC, and the staff were friendly. They explained all the dishes to us and paid attention to our dietary restrictions as well.

We started off with coffee and their warm pistachio crusted goat cheese ball. Their coffee was really good and the cheese ball was amazing! It was a perfect start to the brunch and it came with bread- a little tough but a good balance with the cheese. I ended up ordering their salade lyonnaise. The poached egg was cooked perfectly, my biggest pet peeve is a bad poached egg so I was happy that they did it perfectly. The salad was refreshing and filling- not too heavy on the dressing and everything complimented each other very well. Also- get a side of fries. They're amazing! Overall, great spot for a brunch and I am planning on coming back to check out their dinner.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday earlier this month. It was something different for us since typically favor Latin American and Caribbean cuisine. But boy oh boy, was this place amazing! The flavors of each dish we ordered blew our minds. We were both so glad to have changed things up from our usual. He surprised me and it was definitely a pleasant and welcomed surprise.

For appetizers we shared the Warm Pistachio Crusted Goat Cheese Ball with Honey (the flavors were to die for) and the Flatbread Topped with Portabella Mushrooms (also to die for). Every meal we had was bursting with juxtaposed flavors. So delightful and unique. For our main entrees, my boyfriend had ravioli and cheese (or mac and cheese) and I had the special of the night which were scallops and vegetables. (Had a much fancier name and ingredients than I'm describing, can't find the proper dish names on the menu). I had a pineapple flavored cocktail that I still think about. It was just that good! They really know what they are doing with their flavors both in the food and drinks. Everything was incredible.

The wine of course was wonderful. My boyfriend said they are known for their wine selection and I was impressed with the different tastes and options they had. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive. It can get a bit noisy in the restaurant but the lighting and decor was very romantic and intimate. I was pleased all around with the food and experience and hope to be back here one day. This place is definitely worth your time and will awaken your taste buds!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"We reserved a table for 2 on a lovely Saturday morning for brunch. We had the French toast and the Amelie Omlette. Both dishes tasted absolutely amazing. The vibe of the place is comforting and warm. They had a large collection of wines (we didn't try it, but it sure did look interesting)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Came here on a weeknight around 5pm for happy hour with 2 friends. I have to start off by saying that the food was delicious- we ordered the goat cheese crusted pistachio cheese ball, the roasted cauliflower and the tuna tartare.

The ambiance was perfect and as one would expect the inside of a wine bar in the west village to look like. Unfortunately, the wine itself was not great. We ordered individual glasses to start which were great. After our glasses we wanted to try various wines so we each order a sampler which came with 3 types of wines- but the wines were terrible.  They tasted like they were opened for a while and lacked flavor. We immediately told the waiter and got individual glasses again- which were fine.

Overall, I would come back but I would not try a wine trio sampler. It's a shame because I expected the wine to be the best part about this wine bar, but I will definitely give this place another shot if I'm in the neighborhood.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday dinner as per my request. The idea of a french wine bar with awesome food was too hard to pass up on. Amelie is absolutely amazing. Everything we had from the wine to the food was incredible.

We each got a wine flight ($17 each) which was a steal. They have a large selection of different wines and I simply picked the ones with the most appealing names.

We ordered the Beef Tartare, Pistachio crusted Goat Cheese ball, and a charcuterie board with 2 cheeses and a Pate. Looking back, I wish we had ordered more food as everything was awesome and the entrees looked and smelled phenomenal. I will definitely be back here especially during happy hour where the wine flights are $12!

I apologize for the poor quality photo's, it was very dark and cramped in the restaurant.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,Had a great dinner date with best friend last night. They are definitely a small restaurant and it was really crowded but they made it work anyway. We had to wait at the bar for our table to be ready as we got there early and there was no room at the bar but we were served drinks quickly AND the bar hand gave us water while we waited for our drinks without having to ask for it. We were seated at a very small table by the window basically on top of the couple next to us but it didn't feel super uncomfortable. The food was just savory and delicious and the drinks were great. We also got a red flight to share and all three wines were good. It is more of a 4.5 star but I leaned toward 5 because overall we had a great time.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"We made a reservation for a party of 3 for 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were seated in the back which was more spacious than the rest of the restaurant. Unfortunately on Friday and Saturday, the flight happy hours specials were only available at the bar. We each got a cocktail and they were good and strong. We ordered pistachio crusted goat cheese which came with honey and pickled onion and it was my favorite dish. We also go the beef tartare, escargot which was not as buttery and liquidly as I would like, it was smother with herbs. We also got the chorizo and the ravioli with black truffle.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Amelie is a super cozy French wine bar. It's small but the atmosphere is flawless. I'm so happy I found this spot! It seems to constantly be very busy especially during happy hour. Understandable, since the Happy Hour deal is fantastic. The special includes wine flights, 3 glasses of wine for $12 ($16 past 7 pm). There are several different red and white wine flights to choose from. They also offer a bunch of small plates on the special.

Overall, this is a great spot for wine and some food. It's an intimate spot perfect for a date night.  In order to grab a seat at the bar for Happy Hour try to get there right before 5 pm, after that it got super busy. I would definitely want to come back for another Happy Hour and also to try the food. It smelled delicious!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Amazing happy hour, perfect wine flights and incredible appetizers!

Stopped here one afternoon before dinner with a friend and enjoyed a red wine flight and the goat cheese appetizer. The wine was unique and delightful and the flavors brought together in the goat cheese appetizer were wonderful.

The service was friendly and prompt (we sat at the bar) and once the lights were dimmed the ambiance was there too!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"An awesome place for appetizers and wine! I love coming for the wine flights. The appetizers are amazing as well. We got the truffle ravioli, escargot, chicken pate and the charcuterie.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"This is a great place for happy hour, they have some wonderful specials, the food is yummy. We shared some nibbles, charcuterie with meats and cheeses, the goat cheese appetizer and wines.
I'd like to come back and try more of the menu.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,One of my favorite French places in the city!!! The tartare and pate is amazing and pair it with a nice red wine and I'm in heaven. It often packed to try to get a reservation but the atmosphere inside is what makes it. It's a little dim so if you're older you might want to bring some light/reading glasses but it's adorable.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"comme ci comme sa
We went for early dinner and it was pretty empty.
However, the service was not good. There was one waitress who we told to come back in a few minutes, which turned into way toomany.
There was nothing memorable about the food, the wine or the atmoshphere. Quell dommage!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"The food and drinks here are both delicious.
We started with cocktails...both very strong.
Then we did a flight of wine...definitely a must!
For appetizers we had the mussels...just ok I would not recommend.
We also had the tuna tartare...amazing!
For dinner I had the salmon special...it was perfectly moist and seasoned. My boyfriend has the steak which was just ok...we've had better.
For dessert I had the chocolate cake and my boyfriend had the creme brûlée which he said was the best he's ever had!
Definitely a place worth visiting in the nyc area!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I had a fantastic dinner here on a Saturday evening. Reservations are recommended as we came into a fairly full restaurant. Located just by Washington Square Park, the restaurant is on a quiet neighborhood street. We ordered the Duck, Octopus and Salmon Tartare to share along with a wine taster (3 glasses, at a great price).

I found all three dishes excellent, the vibe perfect, and would definitely visit again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I went here around 5 pm a couple days before New Years. It was great! A little warning though, the lighting gets fairly dark. Dark enough that any pictures  you take may require flash! It's a fairly young crowd, and the place filled up rather quick, so I recommend making a reservation.

Amelie has happy hour, which I thought was at the bar, but I got the 12 dollar wine price for dinner. I recommend the rose flight! It was so good. Honestly, probably the best priced drink you will get in the city! You get a good amount  too. My boyfriend got a white wine flight, which was also very good. Our waiter explained every wine to us, the names, and where the wine was from, and in which  order they should be drank. It was very informative, and he was helpful.

We started with escargot and the charcuterie board. I don't remember exactly which ones we got, but it was all very good. The escargot was also very good- very buttery and flavorful. My first time trying it actually, and it was better than I thought.

For dinner, I ordered the Roasted Duck Leg Confit, which was amazing. It was so flavorful and moist. I just wanted to keep eating! My boyfriend got the steak, which was also very good, but not as good as the duck in my opinion which was just awesome.

Definitely would go back again, even if it's just for the wine flight. Great place for a romantic evening.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"This place is the BOMB!!!  Eric, the manager, is awesome.  We had a glass of champagne to start, a bottle of Burgundy with dinner, and another glass each with cheese...he kept out glasses full for an hour!

The food is amazing.  Escargot - one of the best I've had.  Tuna tartare - delicious.  Duck confit - wow!  Snapper - amazing.  Foie gras - um, I've had better.  Cheese - great selection.

The service is great and friendly.  Tables are a bit small, but hey, it's New York.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"i love this place so much..
Service is so good and fast, it's great place to go on a date or catch up with a friend.
Highly recommend coming here !",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"A cute place to go to for wine and French food! For dinner I would say it's more of a date place as the place gets pretty dark with minimal lighting. Also most of their tables are suited for couples and if you're group is larger it's best to reserve in advance. Their happy hour for wine flights is a good deal and the bar area is stylish. The food is good but not super amazing. It's a solid choice and does not disappoint as I think the prices are fairly reasonable. However, if I were looking for delicious French food I would probably not go here. The experience though is worth it and I've been a couple times so it's definitely worth going back to without breaking the bank!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,Amazing meal! I had the Coq Ai Vin and it was amazing as was the wine pairing.  The place can be loud but the food is super amazing and French. Make sure to make reservations as it is really packed.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"There is really only one way to describe our dinner at Amelie, and it's four very simple letters. OMFG!

No, seriously. OMFG!

Amelie has been on my must-try list for a bit. Well, both our lists. Usually for Jayson's birthday, I like to pick someplace I know is good. (Like Bar Sixty Five last year.) Or, at least a place we've been to, as you don't want a birthday dinner to be an epic fail.

Still, I decided based on the menu, which had four of his faves: duck confit, mussels, truffles (on anything), fromages and charcuteries, I'd risk it and take him here.

Now, when I first walked in, I got a little concerned. It was packed, and a bit small. But, he seemed to love it the second we walked in, so I stayed with it. And, boy am I glad I did.

Everything was absolutely perfect. Even the French guy who was running the place and seated us, who gave a bit of French attitude, was perfect.

The oysters were fresh and absolutely a good selection. (We quickly boosted the order from 1/2 dozen to a dozen.)

The tuna tartare, delish. (And, trust me, lately our luck with finding decent tuan tartare has had some epic disappointments.)

He loves escargot. So do I. But, let's admit it. Most of the time, it's really all about the butter butter and dipping the bread in that. LOL.

I'm not a Foie Gras person. Jayson loved his.

After a few minutes, you kind of forgot that you were in a tiny space because the vibe was so good and food as good as expected.

My recommendation. Definitely make a reservation (we did), otherwise you'll get stuck sitting right at the front where all the foot traffic is, and all the bar activity. Unless that's your thing.

Looking forward to a return soon.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Very enjoyable meal as we ordered the goat cheese with honey and charcuterie platter with Magret duck, Jambon, and manchego cheese. The cod was cooked to perfection, nicely flakey, buttery and a crisp skin. Washed down with some Bloody Mary's and nice bread. Must have items!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"This review is a year late, but I need to mark this down as a very memorable moment.

Although this is a wine bar, they were really accommodating for our family with a child even without a reservation on the weekend.

The wine selection is great as they have listed all the servers recommended tasting flight. We opted to go with this white wine option can't recall which one, but they did pair with all our dishes.

The service here is fantastic as I never had to ask them to refill my water glass.

For the food we ordered the mussels which were really good. They also give you bread on the side which you can dip into the sauce.

For our entrees we ordered the duck confit and the gratin which were delicious. You can really taste the truffle oil in the gratin.

I am very much looking forward to visit again, perhaps just me and my wife only the next time.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Loud - busy night very hard to hear
Fun - lots of folks having a good time
Crowded - no place to wait.

Lots of good wine choices if you know what you are looking at.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Great wine flights and amazing charcuterie! Also great service, our waiter apologized for being slow (really wasn't that slow at all) and gave us a complimentary glass of wine. Also really cool bathrooms which is strange but somehow made a difference. Will be back!

Get the chicken! Also the crab tartine.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Dim lighting, romantic setting, small bites, big flavor!  

Amélie was highly recommended to the girls and I for a nice happy hour in the hustle bustle of New York. We wanted an intimate setting with a variety on the menu as you know- most girls have very specific food preferences  we arrived at happy hour on a Monday night...no problem right? Wrong. The beautiful, yet small restaurant was insanely packed and lively. We were offered a table in about 15 minutes towards the back, thankfully someone cancelled their reservation, so many might not run into such luck.

The wine flights for happy hour are $12 a flight with plenty of delicious options both red and white. Although the regular menu is expensive, there are pleeeeenty of options. I'd be surprised if anyone hesitates finding something they'd enjoy, even though your wallet might! The Happy hour menu has even more choices for less. 5 super bougie crostinis for $15?! Yes please. Not to mention, all the employees are extremely knowledgeable and attentive. I even believe most were French...

Go figure this tiny, discrete wine bar has thousands of reviews. Instead of running to vacation in the big Apple next time, I might just head to France",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I feel weird giving Amelie 3 stars when it's so highly rated across the board, but the meal we had here was just completely forgettable. I'm writing this review not too long after the fact but I'm already struggling to remember anything we ate. Off to cross-check my photos and the menu...

Okay I'm back. Apparently we had the Creekstone beef tartare, Hudson Valley duck leg confit, rack of lamb, and white chocolate Yule log. I wish I could say anything about any of these dishes but I've truly forgotten all of them. They weren't bad at all! Clearly good cooking, just...you know...forgettable and boring. Sorry this has been an utterly unhelpful review.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Cool place and great staff but sadly food a miss here.  Maybe off day - but Saturday afternoon?  Mussels were quite bland - although fresh, the frites were terribly soggy and greasy, and the salad Lyonaise was beautifully made with nice fresh and healthy looking frisée, smoked (wish is was unsmoked ventriche) bacon but the classic mustard vinaigrette was sweetened with sugar.  Like it was playing to freshman college girls from the Midwest - hmmm - looking around in this NYU area place that may be it.  

Some nice wine selections by glass although pricey for the better ones - a more than it should be - I can't say it wasn't an ""ok"" lunch but that's it.  Nice Apple tart by the way tho ..",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Ended up here for a date night with my fiancée because our first choice restaurant had a longer wait time. We were so glad!! Happy we found Amelie! Amazing food, great vibes and all the staff were so friendly. Did I say amazing food!!! We had the pistachio goat cheese and crab tartine for appetizers. AMAZING! I got the lamb burger and my fiancé's ordered the duck. Both were phenomenal. We also ordered the mussels just because we didn't know when we would be able to come back and really wanted to try it. Everything was great. Will be coming back for sure to try more items on the menu. Great experience. Truly GOOD FOOD. Also wine flights were great! Pictures aren't great but will put them just because.. definitely recommend!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Great spot for a glass of wine!
They have a decent selection of affordable wines.
The kitchen is doing a good job to prepare some pretty authentic French food.
Can be crowded and super loud during the week ends.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Truly enjoyed our dining experience at Amelie. Greeted my a friendly maître d who knew I had a reservation (vis Yelp, so convenient) and was waiting for us. He gave me the option of 2 tables and my friends chose the one in front window. The wine list is extensive and diverse. I couldn't decide so went with the Funky red flight. I could have ordered everything off the menu so we settled on mostly apps. Roasted cauliflower with fig jam was delicious. We ordered the main course of ravioli to share as an app and it was a delightful surprise as they were little light raviolis. Delicious! Foie gras was delicious as well as octopus. Also enjoyed the roasted half chicken. By sharing some main courses and ordering appetizers we were able to sample quite a bit of the menu and I will definitely be going back to try more. Service was friendly and timely. Tables are close together but that was not a problem at all.
Only one negative, the music was at a perfect volume; you could hear your friends talk without leaning into much and then halfway through our meal, someone chose to turn the music up much louder. Completely wasn't needed. I like dining at places where I can have a conversation.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Casual and super fun environment, the bartenders and staff are friendly and super nice. So many wines to choose from - French and others as well! Had the mushroom flatbread and it was very tasty - crispy bottom and flavourful toppings.
The ambiance is fun with a crowd. loud and busy but this is New York City :)",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Favorite GNO* spot. I mean, the happy hour flight of wine is more than enough to get your buzz on, but you'll end always get a proper glass (or two). Because wine.

Never ending sliced baguette basket? Yes, please.

Try the paté. Try the mushrooms. Try the salad. Try the curated-by-the-staff flights. Did I mention the staff are all lovely French-speaking gentlemen?

Do book in advance if you can, because it does fill up. Love that it still fills up. And I hope that is the case for many more GNOs to come.

Amélie,Really delicious food! The escargot was amazing and buttery . I recommend the wine flight and I  asked my for recommendations. Was not disappointed!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"A cute lil wine bar and as it turns out, I used to live close to its SF location back in the day on Polk Street. The West Village version is pretty aesthetically similar to what I remember--not a huge place, it's a small bar area and reservations only otherwise, so getting there early is recommended esp. w/o reservations.

They had maybe 8 or so wine flights, which is a lot of wine flights. :) The service was accommodating and despite the fact that it's a small place and lots of folks are buzzing around, they didn't rush my friend and I, which is worth a lot particularly for a wine place in NYC.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"One of my favorite French restaurants in the city. Bread is SUPERB. Foie gras is good too, their duck confit and hanger steak I'd recommend 100%. The creme brûlée is also very good, very classic. Their dishes have a great homemade taste but with restaurant-level quality ingredients. What really makes it for me is the staff here, most servers have French accents which really adds to the ambiance and makes everything homey yet fun at the same time. Space is a little cramped but what can you do it's NYC. Will def be back soon!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Amelie is my absolute go-to wine bar. For special occasions like birthdays, graduations, and new jobs, my friends and I live coming here.

First, the staff is super friendly and they always remember us! It feels so nice to be recognized and treated well. Customer service is awesome as well.

The food is delicious. I have never had a bad meal! I love ordering the cheese plates.

Finally, my favorite: the wine flights during happy hour! For like $12 bucks or something you get three beautiful glasses of wine. It's magnificent.

Make sure to make a reservation because this place is poppin'! Thanks for all the fun memories, Amelie!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"Ordered the escargot, the plate was delivered sizzling hot at our table yet not overcooked. It was perfect. We ordered the cheese and charcuterie which has options of meats and cheeses to choose from. It comes with additional condiments such as mustard, honey, figs, pickled onions, peppercorn and some kind of sweet jam. The gratin was hot, creamy and delicious. Service is great, staff checks in on you often and doesnt feel intrusive. Highly reccomend. Lovely music and enjoyable chill atmosphere.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Amelie had been on my bookmarked list for a while now and my friend and I decided to finally mark it off our list. We made reservations the night before, for Friday at 5:45 PM. The place was packed by the time we arrived and boy were we glad we made reservations!

We started off with their ""Happier Hour"" menu and ordered 2 wine flights (Scotty and Frederic), escargot, and 2 crostinis (smoked salmon and octopus). The escargot was flavorful and delicious! My friend said it vaguely reminded her of baked clams. We even used the complimentary bread and dipped it in the leftover sauce to savor every last bit. The Crostini's were good but nothing outstanding. The bread was toasted perfectly - just the right amount of crunchiness, and the octopus had a pleasant lemony taste.

For entrees, I ordered the highly recommended Duck Leg Confit and my friend ordered the Ravioles. The Duck Leg Confit was really tender and perfectly paired with their mushroom, peas, and potato side.

Highly recommend for date night, girls night out, or just hanging out in general - just be sure to go for HH you definitely won't regret it!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

I was in that side of the village running some errands during my lunch period, so I picked Amelie the day before. They were offering a Croque Madame with a side salad. The sandwich was huge. The salad was tasty.

Staff was very friendly and pickup was very efficient. I would highly recommend them for a solid MealPal option in the area.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Amélie is a cute and cozy cafe that serve delicious brunch.

I came here on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait and plenty of tables to choose from.

I ordered the eggs Benedict with the smoked salmon and substituted the potatoes for their fries. The eggs Benedict was delicious and the smoked salmon on it made it even yummier! I'm glad I switched out the potatoes to their fries because those fries were so good. The prices here all seem reasonable and even if the dish looks small, it was very filling.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Amazing service and food! Took me back to Paris!! Came on in for my Birthday and had a terrific experience! Food was amazing, servers were very kind and once I've mentioned it was my first time there, the bartender gave me and hubby complimentary champagne!! Will be back a thousand times more!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"It has 4.5+ stars for a reason. Hands down the best restaurant I've ever been to in NYC. Wine flights are amazing (at an unbeatable price) and the food is absolutely incredible. The staff went above and beyond to make my boyfriend's birthday extra special.

Small, intimate place perfect for date night. A spot we will be frequenting for years to come.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Come here for the food, and definitely come here for the drinks, especially the wine flights, and especially for the wine flights during happy hour. It is a little cramped when it gets crowded. It can also be a little confusing where to sit especially when it is starting to get busy. The host is running around like crazy telling you what is available and at what times you can do this or that or sit here or there, while also being social. When we asked the wait staff about our seating options (were were a portion of a group which had arrived early), we got more thorough answers.

We did not order food during this visit, only wine, but all the food we saw brought to the nearby tables looked delicious. I was also impressed by the cocktail menu, including the featured selection of classic cocktails (any place with a vieux carre on the menu instantly gets a thumbs up from me).

But those wine flights, especially at happy hour prices, were what sold me. The wines were mostly new to me, which was also a good thing. The pours were decent, and our server took the time to arrange them in recommended order of consumption with some background on each one.

My recommendation would be to come here at the beginning of a happy hour, before it gets too crowded, enjoy the discounted drinks, then some food.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I absolutely loved my solo dining experience at the bar here. The service was excellent, the wine was good, and the food was yummy. The vibe was exactly what I was looking for, too.

Amélie,"We were in the city visiting our son who recently moved here for work. Decided to try because location near his apartment and saw a few good reviews. Glad we did!

First, service was spectacular. Eric was our server and really took care of us.

All our food was excellent. Prepared perfectly and delicious. Even the bread....
We started with the escargot. Wife had the duck. I had the snapper. Again, perfect portions and temp.

Wrapped up with the Chocolate mousse! Again, excellent.

For us, this was exactly the experience we were looking for.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"When life gets me down, I often turn to charcuterie. I came in alone on a Saturday and the place was jam packed with no seats at the bar and an estimated 40 minute wait. I told the host I'd stick it out and wait for an opening. I guess he felt my need and ended up giving me a ""not really a seat"" without a back at the very tip of the end of the bar. I was so grateful.

I sat on my corner, barely spoke to anyone, and treated myself to a really luxurious meal.

First I had half a dozen oysters; they're served with a mignonette instead of a cocktail sauce. I prefer cocktail, but this wasn't so heavy on the vinegar and I ended up being quite happy with it. The oysters were fresh and delicious. Also, let it be noted that any place that allows me to order both a cheese board and oysters has to work hard to make me dislike them.

I did a 5 piece charcuterie plate to start: smoked duck breast, sopressatta, camembert, tete de moine, and brilliant savarin. The brilliant ended up being my favorite cheese, all were on the mild side which was fine by me. The duck was so delicious, and the sopressatta was excellent quality. They also give you so many fixins: two chutneys, a mustard sauce, pickles, caramelized onions, grapes, dried apricots, dried cranberries, and nuts. This might be the most decked out board I've ever ordered, and I blissfully savored each bite, mixing and matching things together till it felt like my tongue was doing cartwheels.

I also ordered the charred Spanish octopus that comes in a ratatouille with harissa aioli. I know that sounds busy, and it is a bit when compared with the other things I ordered, but the octopus was really, really good. It might have been the most tender I've been served, and the char was perfect. If you want to focus more on that texture and flavor, get it without the aioli but even if you keep it on, it won't distract as much as it sounds like it will.

Finally I finished up with a warm apple tart and vanilla ice cream. My only complaint is that there could have been a little more ice cream, but this was delicious and not overpoweringly sweet.

Service was impeccable. Friendly, attentive. And I can't stay enough nice things about the menu. This is a new favorite!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"A few of us came here for a lunch. We really wanted to try the croque madame, so we all ended up getting it and it was awesome! We will definitely be coming back for their happy hour wine flights. Great atmosphere and very authentic Parisian cuisine!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I have been to Amelie a couple times and I was shocked that I haven't written a review yet. Needless to say, this place is awesome. It is good for dates, small groups and even a group of 10! I have never had one bad experience here.

Wine flights are awesome. You get to pick from a bunch of options. Three ""tastings,"" but the tastings are pretty much an actually glass size of wine. During happy hour they are $12 I believe and then outside of that still only $16.

Also, highly recommend their meat/cheese boards as well as their escargots, which is phenomenal!

Love this place and always looking forward to going back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I loved this restaurant. I loved food. That's y I decided to bring my friend there and omg!!! that day the food was so bad!!!!

Amélie,"Came in on a very busy Friday night. Thankfully, we did had reservations set or else it would have been a 3 hour wait on a table and a 30 minute wait for a seat at the bar as per the host. I felt very cramped and super cozy, but that's a positive sign that means this place is legit.

My friend and I had happy hour wine flights. They had a solid selection of many varieties from different regions. You can choose from one of their themes or make your own flight. We were very happy with our choices and the pricing was solid for wine.

We had a cheese board for starters which I would definitely recommend. Delicious and came with dried fruits, jams and honey to go along with. It also came with nice, warm bread. They weren't stingy with the bread too. We were nearly full from the bread since the bread basket probably contained a full loaf.

Next we had fries which were surprisingly amazing. I mean, it's French fries, how good can you really make it? The French fries here were truly mind blowing and came with two succulent sauces.

We finished off with salad and French onion soup. Solid, good flavor but nothing to really write home about.

I'd come back here again for maybe just the cheese board and wine flights. They were satisfying and filling since they give you so much bread.

It would be a 5 star experience if not for the service time. From what I observed there was only 1 waiter and 1 busser at the time and the restaurant was stuffed like a can of sardines. We waited an exceptionally long time for menus, water, wine, food and the check. The staff was trying their best and work very hard but maybe having more people on the floor would provide patrons a better experienceZ",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Fantastic happy hour! Most bars just leave bar seating to the patrons which can lead to awkwardly lingering next to people who appear as though they might be getting up or pushing through a crowded bar in hopes of snagging a seat, but amélie maintains a very organized seating system to ensure a pleasant experience. The wine flights can't be beat and the service is excellent! Will certainly return!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Amelie is quite lovely! I found my eyes wandering a lot to check out all the design quirks around the room. The room itself is dimly lit with a soft, red glow.

We started out with happy hour specials (which is every day until 7 pm). Along with an offering of a variety of wine flights for $12, the goat cheese and escargot were also offered at happy hour prices.

The goat cheese was probably my favorite dish of the night. The goat cheese was crusted with finely powdered pistachio, on top of a bed of pickled onions and honey. This had nutty, tangy, acidity and sweetness, and was a great balance of flavors. Make sure to smear it all over the delicious baguette!

I also tried escargot for the first time, despite studying abroad in Paris and subsequent travels to thereafter. I am still not quite ready for it, I think, as I wanted the parsley sauce to be much more assertive to mask the taste of the escargot meat a bit. But my mom quite enjoyed it, so there you go.

We also shared the ratatouille to balance out all the creaminess and butter. It was a well prepared ratatouille, but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again.

For my entree, I ordered the duck confit, which was FABULOUS. The kitchen achieved that tantalizing crispy skin with the fall-off-the-bone tender meat inside. It was so juicy, and the jus coated the fingerling potatoes and mushrooms with a delicate balance of umami flavor. I also appreciated the frisee salad on top, which brightened up the dish considerably. I was actually surprised by how fresh this salad was - it wasn't wilted in any way and looked like the kitchen just got the salad from the market that day.

We finished off the meal with the creme de citron. Oh gawd, if you are a lover of lemon/lime things, you must get this! The creme de citron packs a punch of acidity without being overwhelming. It is balanced out beautifully by the fresh oranges and grapefruits. The dish was served with almond crackers (not a crumble in contrast to what the menu says). But yummy regardless.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,Very cool and casual place good for a gathering of friends or a casual date! Loved the food especially the pizza,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"Come here and get the pistachio crusted goat cheese ball and thank me later. Absolutely one of the tastiest items on this menu. I love the unlimited bread and love that it comes in an actual sack. I came here with my gf who had the steak frites and I had the lamb burger. The food was great, the drinks were delicious,  and the service was good. I'm writing this review the very next day because I'm still thinking about how good the cheese was. Definitely coming back here during lunch so I can try their happy hour menu.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Delicious little French spot in Chelsea. I ordered the Amélie lamb burger and my girlfriend went with the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon.

The lamb burger isn't gamey at all and I would add the cheese. The pickled onions with the harissa sauce and yogurt sauce really set the burger aside from any lamb burger I've had. Of course who could forget the fries, you can't come to a French restaurant without trying the fries. Perfectly fried and not greasy. I would definitely come back again for brunch or even dinner.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"This place has a special spot in my book.

The food is consistently outstanding, and the wine never disappoints.

The price point is too good to be true for the food, to be honest.

Service is always above-par, and what it lacks in sexy ambience, it makes up for everywhere else.

I am not entirely sure what the inspiration for the vibe was or is, but I like it, and the product outside of the red overhead tenting surpasses the assumption of standard West 8th Street/NYU staples.

In short: absolutely go, but get a seat in the booth against the wall, and get the whole fish + Sancerre.

100% worth it, and the bill ices the cake.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"It's truly my happy place in NYC. I lost counts of how many time I have been here. They have great options of wine, and the waiters always give you great recommendations. And I love love love their gigantic  wine glass. They have great appetizers.
Couple recommendations:

Goat cheese ball - a must try, eat it with their bread, it's delicious.
Crostini - the mango one is my favorite. $3 each or $21 try all the flavors.
Salmon tartare - used to be one of my fav, but I went back last Friday, I couldn't find it on the new menu, so I ordered tuna tartare, the presentation of the dish is alright, and the taste is not as good.
steamed mussels, and the new  PES mussels - it's fresh and delicious, dip the bread into the soup, it tastes amazing.
Tsucan kale salad -  delicious, a perfect balance between fruits and veggies.
Fondant au chocolat - my favorite dessert of theirs
Banana cream brulee - One of the best cream brulee ive had

Not just about the food, the services here is the reason why I keep coming back. The waiters, bartenders, managers are all very friendly and make you feel welcomed. I definitely recommend this place for groups and dates. Dont forget to make a reservation cause this place is always packed.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Recently came here with my boyfriend for a date night. I'd been to Amelie before during my NYU days, but mostly for cheese and small plates, so this was my first experience with their actual food menu.

We had reservations for 7PM - a good idea because the space is small and perpetually crowded. Despite happy hour ending at 7, the waiter let us order off that menu (2 flights of wine for $12 each). For food, we split the grilled octopus, artichoke salad, and seared salmon over quinoa. Everything was well prepared and tasted fresh, though the salmon crust was way too salty for my taste. I didn't have any, but my boyfriend also enjoyed the complimentary (and unlimited) French bread.

Overall a great neighborhood spot with decently priced food and drinks.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Was very excited to try this place, but was rather disappointed. The restaurant itself it very small. I felt as if I was on top of the people at the table next to me.

We started with the cheese plate, which was absolutely delicious. I almost wish I ordered 2 and just had that as my entree.

For entrees we had the duck confit and the special cod. The cod was okay but the duck had absolutely no seasoning or flavor. It had a strong, gamely taste that was hard to stomach and was on top of a pile of potatoes that were also unseasoned. I was only able to take 3 bites before giving up.

I did however enjoy the wine flight. Might be a better spot for apps and wine than dinner.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"If this review could only be one sentence it would go like so:

""Get the warm goat cheese ball & thank me later""

Seriously. It's my favorite item on the menu & it's ridiculously cheap for NYC prices. Especially considering the bag of warm bread you also get, and if it's happy hour, the cheap wine flights.

Amelie is a dream of a wine bar, with excellent wine choices on the menu, great flights, and generous pours. The ambiance is romantic & sweet, with dim lights and a buzzy energy.

If one of the entrees piques your interest go with that, but every single time I've come here I've made a meal from the cheeses, meats, and appetizers. All affordably priced, the cheese boards are stacked and have a great selection of cheeses to pick from. The appetizers are all good (beyond just the goat cheese ball) and I highly suggest the Brussels sprouts for the balsamic, bacon, and (unexpected) pineapple!

This place is a must-go. Make a reservation, as it can get packed, and go early for the amazing happy hour deals!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Great place for brunch in the area!! Got the eggs benedict and french toast (shown in pic), both were really great and very reasonably priced. Loved the bread basket as well, it was the first time I've seen a bread basket with brunch! Just wish the bread was a bit fresher/warmer. Seems like they serve brunch late, some people around us were ordering lunch as well (we went around 12:30 on a Saturday). The wine bar seemed like a fun lowkey area, may have to visit again later in the day for that!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"This review is for the wine flights and small plates. I'll have to come back and try this place again, because I came at 4 pm, which was their transition from lunch to dinner. 5 was when the full menu would be offered but my girlfriend and I settled for some wine and small plates.

I like this place because they have $12 wine flights which come with 3 glasses. They are very generous with the wine portions. I basically felt like I had 3 actual glasses of wine. They have a bunch you can choose from, and you can even customize. I did the sweet whites, and my friend did the rosés. I was happy with my sweet white selection!

For food I ordered two crostinis. They're pretty small, imagine a little sliced baguette but they were only $3.50 each. I ordered the goat cheese and roasted peppers and the smoked salmon crostinis. They were delicious and nicely presented.

I'll be back for lunch or dinner soon!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"This is a very serviceable happy hour location in the village. The bartender was very attentive and kept the Aperol spritzes flowing, which is a drink I tried for the first time and surprisingly really enjoyed. Food was underwhelming, but what can you do.

AMBIANCE: modern French. The space is really small so it didn't offer too much space to stand. Not great for big groups.
FOOD: overall good, but some dishes were much better than others
- must try the brillat Savarin cheese! It's buttery, soft, flavorful without over powering.
- steak: medium rare really good (according to my fiancé)
- the escargot, apparently not as buttery as it could have been!

Overall: great to come once, but may not repeat.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"It was raining on a Saturday Night of February 17th 2018.  I made reservations here with my girlfriend for 7pm.  The receptionist area is at the back of the restaurant so we walked over and stated my name.  The guy stated I already checked in as he said ""wait a minute here I think someone try to make a fool of me"".  I thought it was hilarious haha as he seated us right away after the confusion and given us the menu and the wine selections.  

Service: The waiter gave us water and bread right at the start.  The bread was warm and tasted so good.  This was the first time I could eat bread without butter.  The bread was already delicious without it haha.  We began looking through the menu.  The wine menu was probably larger than the actual dinner menu.

Food: We were excited to try the Roasted Duck Leg Confit with wine.  We started off with the appetizer which was the Hand Cut Steak Tartare, then 2 orders of the Roasted Duck Leg Confit.  The steak Tartare looked very small on the plate, but just a small piece of the tartare just melted in my mouth and the tartare matched well with the bread as I put both together and it was just simply delicious.  We waited for our main course as the bread was already done after the appetizer.  To get more bread, you will need to let the waiter know because the restaurant is so busy that they don't really check for you from my experience here so far.  The Roasted Duck Leg Confit looked so good as there was some vegetables on the bottom of the duck leg.  The duck was very juicy and I took my time to enjoy each and every bite as my girlfriend devoured it 5 minutes after I finished.  

Advice:  make sure you get wine that pairs well with your meal otherwise you will not get the whole experience.

Overall: Its definitely a nice place for special occasions.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"What a romantic place. Food is traditional NoLa faire stepped up to compliment the overall ambiance. Highly recommend for a date night, perhaps not your main date night, however.

Amélie,"Came here on a Friday night for dinner with a friend and we had such a good time just eating and drinking food wine! This place has actually been on my bookmark list for a while and I finally got to try it and obviously I was not disappointed.

This can be a very cute date spot (I did see quite a number of couples) but can be a good place for girlfriends to go to. However please note this is not a big place so really not suitable for a large group!

One thing I really appreciated was that their happy hour is until 7PM every day! The happy hour includes food and drinks. It seemed when I read reviews everyone got the wine flight tastings so we did as well! For $12 I think it's a great deal. But the highlight out of everything we had here was the pistachio goat cheese! Wow that cheese!!! The goat cheese is encrusted with pistachio and served warm over what seemed like caramelized onions drizzled in honey. Just how great was it? My friend and I ordered three!

FYI: pistachio goat cheese is part of the HH menu...you're welcome :)",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Came here for my birthday weekend and it was every bit as amazing as I thought it would be.  Started with the Burgundy Escargots Gratines... I had never tried escargot in a red wine reduction... it was the best escargot I've ever tried.  I say this as a French woman who has been to Paris several times... it was just pure indulgent perfection.  Especially with the delicious fresh bread to soak it up.

For dinner had the Duck Leg Confit.  Don't eat duck very often and this was completely amazing.  This was paired with the Côtes du Jura Domaine Lornet... at $46 a bottle it felt like a bargain for a birthday splurge in the city.  Went with the Fondant du Chocolat for dessert and it was simple and very, very good.

The service was attentive and on point, didn't have to ask or want for anything from start to finish.  This was the perfect place to celebrate, just really consistent and excellent, beautiful ambience and authentic, warm.  Yes, tables are tightly spaced but that is to be expected.  I will come back when I visit again to take advantage of happy hour.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

I love that not only do they do wine flights, they also have set suggestions for reds and whites. I wanted to mix and match so I got two of the smooth reds and a Pinot Grigio. They were amazing. 3 glasses for $12? Can't beat that! But wait, there's more!

When we finished our glasses the waiter asked which one we liked best, we told him and he brought out an additional glass of our favorite! Awesome place, will def be back to try food",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Came here with a friend for a nice dinner and that's exactly what we got. Once arrived we were seated immediately and given water.

The wine selection was endless, I ordered a Malbec and my friend ordered the Pinot noir.

My friend and I split the oysters, pistachio crusted goat cheese, escargot, and the frisée salad which had bacon and a poached egg. (I can't remember the name but it was the last salad on the menu and started with the letter L)

Everything was SO good! My favorite was the salad b/c of the bacon. But everything we ate was full of flavor and served relatively quickly.

The prices are somewhat high so be prepared to shell out  some cash. Definitely worth it tho!

You'll see me back for sure",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

I've been also to their UWS location. Both are charming, and a great place to add to your go to spot. Only down side, you have to order food to get the bread basket. Awwwwww.....",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I had been here a couple of times a few years ago
and finally made it back today. Today was far less pleasant.

The Brussels sprouts were soggy, the goat cheese salad had almost no flavor aside from the goat cheese, and the steak tartare tasted more sugary than anything else. Also $12 for a side of soggy Brussels sprouts is highly aggressive.

Overall the food was not worth the dinner out. The wine was good though!",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I'm not sure if I'm crazy or if everyone else is.

I brought my mother to NY for Mother's Day Weekend and had bookmarked Amelie as one of my go-tos the next time I was in town. I had a craving for Foie Gras, made a reservation and convinced my mom to take the trek over from Midtown East.

Our server was very nice and asked if we wanted to start with a drink but I was there for the food. Mom ordered the Cod and I ordered the Foie Gras (of course). When the meal came out the first thing to hit me was the smell of the fish and the second was the underwhelming looking Foie Gras. Nonetheless, I decided ""hey, I'm here, I'm hungry, may as well eat"". I ended up finding a piece of plastic in my foie gras and that's when everything went downhill. I immediately felt sick and I was DONE.

We waived the server over and let him know about the plastic and he ended up being very gracious about it but it's just not enough to make me ever go back. The total ended up being $30 and change after he removed my meal and I tipped $10 because the server is obviously not at fault. Why they would serve smelly fish, I don't know.

I don't know if they had an off night and I was unlucky or if this is the norm, but, I'm completely grossed out by our meal and sad that I wasted my money and time at what should have been a nice dinner in NY at this place when I could've gone anywhere else.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

This is the original location of a french restaurant and wine bar (I've been to the location on the upper west side and was also extremely impressed!). There is a good amount of space and it has a nice ""cozy"" atmosphere (e.g., soft lighting, decorative bar). Their wine flights are a good option, if you're looking to drink.

Escargot and tuna tartare apps were great.  Cod had crispy skin and flesh not overdone.  And leeks underneath went well with it.  Haricots were just right.  A safe bet.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I would give this place 6 stars if I could!!!! Have loved it since I was in college and don't come here frequently, but every dish I have ever ordered is delicious in its own way.  It also helps that hubby and I came here on our fifth date to celebrate my bday so I'm quite fond of that memory :)

We went this past week and ordered the:
- Goat cheese ball (6/5): I'm lactose intolerant and I still want to have a whole appetizer to myself, it's that good.  Sweet from honey, creamy, and well textured from the pistachio coating, with some caramelized onions on the side.  Amelie is generous with their bread and hubby and I swiped up every single last drop of that plate
- Steak tartare (4/5): I quite liked this, a good mixture of tastes, but for some reason my hubby the meat eater didn't, might be because he doesn't like his meat rare
- Brussel sprouts (4/5): hubby liked this one because it was a solid veggie side dish.  I liked it too, tho I prefer my brussel sprouts crispy and this one was more sautéed
- Coq au vin (4/5): again, I quite liked it, you can tell the wine sauce was reduced for hours on end to get it that well done.  I think hubby didn't like it because the bacon in the dish taste a bit smoky, which I think is amazing and he doesn't (he's wrong!)
- Salad with frisée and bacon (5/5): this has always been my entree every time I've been here, and it is always consistent! Creamy, a bit rich even for salad, with an egg that pierces for a runny yolk, with a ton of bacon, just the way I love my salads.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Complementary champagne, exclusive friendly service and much more.
I choose this place after my french friend recommended it to me.
Of course yelp reviews are great too, these two were enough reasons to choose this place.
When i made a reservation , I put a note that I prefer a romantic table and mentioned that i am excited to try this place.
I was late for few minutes, they were very flexible about it. They did give my table away because my date was late as well. But , i totally get it.
While we were waiting for another table to be ready, we were served a complementary champagne by the host.
We got a nice table closer to the window and was greeted by our amazing server Erick! I have to say we did wait little bit until he came by but the only reason was Because they were packed. And Erick had alot on his plate.
He had a great knowledge about the menu and gave us amazing recommendations. We ended up getting an app of 2 types of meat and cheese and for entree the 2 types of fish they had on the menu.
Wine was good, we had Malbec all night and got a complementary glass too.
The ambiance was amazing very chill and romantic. Food was very good and my date was impressed by it too.
Erick is great and the busser was always around to fill up our water. There was another person coming back and forth i think he was the manager. They were all friendly! We will be back and I will let all my friends know about this romantic cool place! Thank you guys! Keep up the good work !",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"For MealPal: I had the Croque Madame today, and it was absolutely delicious! Perfectly warm when I got it, and the whole combination of egg, cheese, and ham was really amazing. It's been a while since I've dined in the restaurant, but now I definitely want to come back again :).",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Looking for a nice candle lit dinner that won't break the bank? Well look no further because there's something special about this dimly lit, cute little French wine bar. Maybe it's the staff whom all spoke French, maybe it's the delicious bread and wide selections of wine, cheese and meats but either way I loved every aspect of it! Shoutout to our server who was knowledgable and very helpful when it came to choosing our wines along with the charcuterie and cheese pairings.

We came during happy hour and opted for a wine flight which includes 3 wines of your choice for $12. To go with the flight, we got the escargot ($6), warm pistachio crusted goat cheese ball ($6) and a pick 3 charcuterie and cheese plate ($18). They also offer unlimited complimentary bread so don't be shy to ask for more. The escargot comes without the shell and paired extremely well with the bread seeing that not a single drop was left by the end of our meal. The warmed up goat cheese ball made such a difference - it's flavor and texture was good alone or paired with the bread. The charcuterie and cheese plate came with some spreads, honey, fresh grapes, dried fruits, caramelized onions and pickles along with your chosen meats and cheeses.

Amélie has sparked my newfound love for wine paired with charcuterie, cheese and more. 5 stars all around goes to a lively yet intimate atmosphere, spectacular service, delicious food, great happy hour deals and a phenomenal experience. I would most definitely recommend this spot for your next date night! Make reservations or come early because they get packed here in the evenings.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"I'm a huge fan of Amelie, and have been going there for years.  There's not many cons to the place, so I'll list the highlights below.  

-- Wine flight (3 glasses / $16, $12 if HH) is a great deal, and offers lots of varieties to try.  
-- Charcuterie board (up to 5 different meats/cheeses) is super delicious, with lots of options.  Plus it comes with generous amounts of bread, along with fruit/nuts/spreads.  
-- Chicken Liver is really good, and also comes in a very generous portion.  
-- Service is great, and you can tell they genuinely care about your experience.  I've never had bad service EVER at Amelie, which is pretty impressive considering how many times I've gone there.  

Overall, Amelie is a 5 star worthy place, and I highly recommend.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"My favorite restaurant without a Michelin star. Amelie is laid back, elegant, charming and cool. The food is all delicious and their wine tasting menu's are to die for. I always get two flights and one of them always is the spicy red's flight. I always bring visitors here because it shows how many hidden gems are in the city. I even got to keep one of the little books your bill comes in. Love this place and the staff!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Oh, the luck. I found Amelie via Yelp. Awesome choice. Cozy place - I sat at the bar. Oysters yummy and salty. The seared filet was the best I have has in a long time: juicy, a little soicy, covered in tiny slices of scallions. They gave me a whole bag of sliced bagetre - I have not seen this presentation before. Not wanting to leave yet, I ordered the creme brulle. Another good aurprise: under the glazing were thinly sliced bananas. At first I worried - people mess up bananas. But it was for nothing. Delicious!

I recommend Amelie, whether dining alone like me, or as a couple, like the two next to me.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Fun place with fun food.

Food: First, unlimited bagguette!!!!

Warm pistachio crusted goat cheese ball ($8): This was my favorite dish actually. It had goat cheese wrapped in crust and had honey onion marmalade. You can put it on bread and enjoy. I do confess that I love cheese overall and I love goat cheese among others. However, besides that wonderful ingredient, there were many others as well. I love when the savory flavors are combined with the sweet flavors in a harmonious way. Neither the sweet or the sour savory overpowered, but instead worked together and complemented each other. This dish was very complex and really made an impression despite the small size. You could tell that thought went into flavors, textures and presentation. It all worked really well and was very creative. Food is an art and this was a great piece. I wish I just ordered two of these as my whole meal.

Chicken liver mousse a la poire ($10): okay, nothing too impressive. This was partly because in some other cooking, such as Eastern European cooking, liver paste is quite common and cheap. Don't get me wrong, I like the paste but to me it's quite a common snack and nothing special.

Prince Edward island mussels ($18): Great for dipping the bread in. The sauce was tasty and there was a lot of it, which is great.

Definitely would come back for that goat cheese ball.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"An intimate, rustic French restaurant with provincial style menu and excellent wine pairings.

For entree, The French onion soup was a cheesy, delicious treat.  Perfect.

The beef bourguignon was brilliantly rich.  Be sure to soak it up with bread.

The cheese selections are wonderful to enjoy your  selected wine, even a wine tasting paddle.

A popular taste of France in the village!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Came here with my family after shopping around soho and also have been here several times. The wine selection is great, especially their wine flights for tasting. The foods also so delicious and pairs well. In true french style, all the tables are placed really close to each other and can feel cramped. That's fine when you have some wine and some time to get close and personal with your date/friend.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Great lunch with charming service.
We each had something different and every one liked their dish.

I had a grilled chicken sandwich which came on lightly toasted ciabatta bread with lettuce and tomatoes and slices of avocado as well as gruyere. I opted for no mayo. Didn't need a thing with the creamy avocado. Came with a side salad if mixed greens.

Husband had their burger -- perfectly cooked as ordered -- it came with those famous crispy thin fries (served with mussels). Yum.

My friend had a cheese and ham and mushroom omelet. Came with chunky potatoes. She ate every bite!

For dessert, we shared an apple tarte served slightly warmed with fresh strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream along side. Not too sweet so we felt we were eating healthy!  Yum.

Shhh. Don't tell anyone about this place. We will be back...",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Very casual atmosphere and great service too! All around amazing place.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"I came with a friend without a reservation on a Saturday night. They were able to seat us by the bar within 10-15 minutes. We each got a wine sampler. It was really hard to hear from the server which wine was what given how loud it was. To be quite honest, my three reds tasted very similar. For my meal, I ended up getting the steak aux echalottes, which was very good but I was still a little hungry afterwards. In retrospect, their portion size may have been normal, but smaller than most other places and than what I expected for $32. We also noticed that we didn't get any bread when other tables and other people at the bar did. We weren't sure if the bread was complimentary or not.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Wine is superb. Food is fantastic. Service was lovely.

Make a reservation if you're dining for dinner. There was never an empty table and you'll be very friendly with your neighbors as it's a small space.

We ordered the crostini's (you must try the smoked salmon), salad lyonnaise, wine flight, goat cheese ball, and the burrata. Phenomenal!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Overall: Pretty standard wine bar, not exceptional

Atmosphere: It can get a little loud, taking away from the intimate/dim setting.

Food: The Gratin de Ravioles du Royans was pretty good, just a little heavy/overwhelming. The chocolate mousse was also a bit much. The servers actually gave us (2) another one after for free for some reason, which would have been fine if it wasn't so rich. Would not recommend getting it.

Drinks: The wine flights are fine, nothing memorable.

Service: Nothing to complain about.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"All around a phenomenal experience. The waiting and hosting staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive, the atmosphere was lively yet intimate, and the food was fantastic.

My girlfriend and I had been looking forward to trying this place out for a few weeks and the expectations were fairly high. All expectations were exceeded, and I can't recommend a better place to take a date and try some French food.

The wine flights were fun, the escargot in garlic butter was great, the Camembert cheese dip was incredible and deceivingly filling, and the banana creme brûlée was absolutely fantastic, especially for people who aren't into overly sweet desserts like myself.

The whole experience was a 10/10. Cheers!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"Came here during happy hour on Wednesday evening at 6PM and there were plenty of seats. The first thing I noticed was how uncomfortable the chairs and tables were. It was cramped with minimal space. We ordered 3 flights and 3 plates of food which couldn't fit the small table and made it a disaster to eat/drink. The service however was impeccable. Empty wine glasses were collected right away, our waters were always full, everything was quick and the servers are super attractive with their French accents!

For food we ordered:
Warm Pistachio Crusted Goat Cheese Ball - Very good but it was literally the size of a pin-pong ball. I could've easily devoured the whole thing by myself. I didn't notice the pistachio but the onion marmalade was a stand out. I wish their bread wasn't so thick so that I could've enjoyed the cheese more.
Rosette de Lyon - This was okay. Their charcuterie has gotten more expensive last I checked.
Hudson Valley Duck Leg Confit - This was good but I've had better at other French restaurants. The mushrooms and potatoes paired nicely. The duck was tender but the only let down is the soggy skin... as I expected a crispy one.

The bill was close to $100 for 2 people and we were both still hungry unfortunately. The food overall was okay. The real reason why I am giving this place 4 stars is because their wine is DELICIOUS! The selections are so perfect. I tried a little bit of everything from pinot noirs to malbec and whites. I loved every single one of them. If I ever return it would just be for the wine.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amélie,"We tried looking for a nice restaurant for a special day, so we saw Amelie. Thinking it had a 4.5-star-rating, we had high expectations. The place ended up being very small, warm, and a bit noisy. The service was not very good. We tried the foie gras and the duck confit, which are their most popular dishes. Their dishes lacked balance and ate salty. The duck was dry and the skin was not crispy. Overall, not a very good dining experience for a place that has this high a rating. I don't think I would recommend.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,Love this place for happy hour. You can taste 3 wines for $12 and they don't just serve you a tiny tasting pour either. The servers are super nice and willing to listen to what types of things you like and help you choose based on that. They have a little bit of outdoor seating but most is indoors. All around great spot to grab a glass of wine.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"of course the wine here is very good, but i was very pleasantly impressed by the food at Amélie! i went for happy hour and ordered a few appetizers and small bites to share with my friend for a light dinner. everything was quite delicious! the octopus, the crab tartine stick out in my mind. when we arrived around 6:15 the place was half empty and we were able to get a nice spot in the back tables (very cute ambiance) but by the time we left it was very busy, so definitely recommend getting there early if you can",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amélie,"The restaurant certainly have a great  atmosphere and a great vibe. Quite modern French feeling. As for the menu, we ordered the escargot which was nice. The goat cheese ball was on the sweet side. Too sweet for me as a starter, but very interesting taste. For the main we had the duck confeti, which tasted good but could hv been better if the skin were crispy. I think it was partly due to the veges salad they put on top (the moisture from the salad). If they improve this, it will make this dish a more enjoyable experience. N don't hide the duck under the salad. The cocktails were really nice. The French Connection was very refreshing. As for Crème blûlée, the creme with banana-taste tasted wonderful. The coating top was a bit too thick. Very enjoyable. Good service. We will come back for the mussel. I recommend this place (8/10). Great place for date night.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/am%C3%A9lie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Too many favs to mention here -but you MUST try the tuna tartare with a green matcha sponge or the maitake mushroom as starters. While neither my husband or I have dietary restrictions, we took my niece (a Vegan) for dinner. When we mentioned this to the server, the Chef came to our table to speak to her, made suggestions, and offered to make her whatever she wanted!

The Osprey,"3.5 stars.

Nothing is WRONG with this place. Their food is fine; actually, it is very good. Solid presentation, flavoring, etc. But nothing really stands out that would lead me to trek down to Dumbo again to go here.

Also, it is a little pricier than I'd like. Yes, I know I'm paying for the real estate (DUMBO property does not come cheap); all those beautiful plants they have cost money to upkeep; all the beautiful plates also cost a pretty penny; the overpowering scents they keep in the bathroom also probably come at a cost (or maybe that's built into their rent since the bathroom seems to be shared with the hotel)...

Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that they make very good solid food but it is more expensive than I'm willing to pay for it. And if I have to pay a premium because it's DUMBO etc etc...then it gets 3.5 stars from me.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"I'm in love with this place and I can't wait to go back. I went during Restaurant Week for lunch with my mom, boyfriend and daughter. I got the jerk chicken. I was hesitant because I'm Jamaican and very particular about my cultural dishes but I was pleasantly surprised. It was a very nice portion and very flavorful. My mom got the salmon and I had a yummy piece. We had some sort of puréed soup which was great and my boyfriend enjoyed his mushroom appetizer.  For dessert I got chocolate which was soooo rich. They ordered the cheesecake, and I ate theirs as well . It was soo sweet and amazing.

I am thinking of having my birthday brunch here and staying at the hotel with how much I enjoyed the service, the view and the food.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The ambience of this place is great but the food is nothing to brag about. I came here for lunch with some girl friends and while it was nice to sit by their big windows sipping wine, I just wish the food was better.

The beef skewers - pretty tough and chewy, so prob a cheaper cut of meat?
Tuna tatare - this was good. fish was fresh and the flavor was nice
Brussel sprouts salad - this was good but the dressing was too sour
Hen of the woods (mushroom salad) - this was good
Seafood cobb - this was disappointing. You get a lobster tail, 2 pcs of whole shrimp, a few chunks of crab, 1 egg split in half topped with fish roe, 1/2 avocado, grape tomatoes, corn, bacon and crumbly blue cheese. This is more of a eat everything separately since you can't really mix the whole chunks of everything. So the concept is nice especially if you're a seafood lover like me, but the taste? It just didn't go together.
Hanger Steak and fries - DRY AF. DO NOT get this

Our waiter was very nice and accommodating especially with our wine selection. Unfortunately for the price tag and sub-par food, this will not be a repeat for me.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The Osprey,"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and was really impressed with the service, setting and food was really outstanding.

Walking into the place, you see the beautiful bar and the spectacular view of the bridge and Manhattan.  The friendly staff are warm and welcoming.  I sat down with my friends and ordered a terrific drink (what the Doctor said) and had it very quickly.

The excellent server shared the special starters with us and we ordered both of them as well as the cheese board.   The cheese board was very good and the spicy ahi tuna combo was good too.  Mussels were fine but the rice was amazing in the broth.

For entrees, three of us had the NY Strip.  It was excellent and filling, served over delicious spinach and served with grilled onion slices that I loved!  I could have eaten several more of those.  The french fries were also good.   Our other two friends had the tomahawk steak and it came out and looked very underwhelming.   At $125, it didn't even look as big as the $55 NY Strip.  That's not to say that two people couldn't share the NY Strip (they could, but I wouldn't because it was so tasty!) but to advertise something that is supposed to be impressive meal for two and then have it show up looking like about 16oz of meat with a giant bone was disappointing.   Luckily, management staff members here are experts on service.  When this was pointed out to the server, she talked to the chef and the manager and all agreed it shouldn't have come out of the kitchen.  In addition to the server being very apologetic, the manager also offered a gracious apology.   Instead of being something that ruined a very expensive and special meal, they turned it into a five star experience.

That continued with dessert, where we ordered three desserts to share among the five of us but they brought a couple of extra desserts for the birthday girl.  Really unexpected but very appreciated.

I would definitely come back here; it was a really high quality experience.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Such a gorgeous place to dine at!

You can easily come during the light or dark hours and be  astonished by the beauty and atmosphere of this place!

When I walked in, it was still light outside and the place looked like the upscaled backyard with quite and romantic feeling. When I was leaving and all the lights and lamps were on, it looked like a magical fairytale.

Fresh salad with heirloom tomatoes and peaches is a mix I've never tried before and I'm sure if I order it somewhere else, no other place will be able to top it!

Fried shaved Brussels sprouts with sliced almonds in sweet sauce were to fight for! This will be my family dish to prepare for all the future gatherings! I just wish there was a little less oil added to it.

Hen of the woods is an amazing way to prepare mushrooms and keep thinking about it long after you are done eating it....still thinking about... yep, still thinking.

Cavatelli what a way to prepare pasta! I stopped eating pasta for a while now and just try it sometimes, if someone at my table orders it, because all the restaurant make it so simple and boring that I regret ordering as soon as I try it. This pasta with pea pesto and a light mint and lemon aftertaste is something to dream about when thinking about the ideal pasta meal.

NY strip, again I haven't ordered NY steak for year because no matter what restaurant makes it, it is always a good piece of meat..., but so boring! The osprey takes NY steak to the next level with wasabi spinach and puffed buckwheat.

Dessert
Campfire s'mores and coconut passion fruit were just big enough and diverse enough to satisfy the sweet tooth and not force yourself to eat more than you should.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Perfect for a date night , or just a night to explore the Brooklyn bridge area .
I recommend getting reservations for the outdoor seating, which I wish I had known prior to , but I will be back to try their brunch for sure .

The Osprey,"Don't be discouraged by the 3-star rating like I was!
The place actually wasn't bad!

We were hungry and walking by when we both stopped and noticed the restaurant's outdoor setting that we decided to just eat here.
You can choose to sit inside, outside, or get the best of both worlds and sit inside overlooking the outside like we did.

I ordered the Avocado Toast ($23) and my boyfriend ordered the The Osprey Burger ($22).
The food was pretty good. My (mostly salmon) toast was fresh and tasty, but I mainly loved the place for the beautiful interior and green scenery. The service was mediocre as we had to ask to refill our water.

Try the Smoked Hamachi on a warm summer's night or the Ricotta Cavatelli for something light yet filling. Apparently, there is a fee to go to the rooftop upstairs, but if you dine here, they waive it? Worth the drunken Uber ride over the bridge (story for another day).",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Lets just start with the location. This rooftop hovers over most of the restaurants in this area. Its only on the 10th floor but its right on the east river overlooking the Brooklyn bridge. To be honest, its a fantastic environment! If you are looking for ambiance, you'll find it here!!

Now you know this place is in Dumbo! If your pockets aren't right, dont come here! The cheapest thing on their drink menu is beer and that isnt cheap either. I had their rose. It was amazing! I was joining my husband and his cousin who had spent all afternoon there while they waited from me to get off work. Lets just say their tab was quite steep!

I had my husbands left over fish taco. I only had one but from what i tried, it was okay. I'll have to come back and try the food. It was a Monday. The weather was good. The vibes were correct and the music was great! Its not a hippy place at all. They had a mix of r&b and pop music subtly playing in the background. The decor is clean and chic.

On Yelp the restaurant has two $$ however, a more accurate pricing would be $$$. The dishes were a fusion of gourmet, American comfort food. I shared the half roast chicken, and it was pretty good. It wasn't anything out of this world, and deff overpriced. Our deserts were free because of checking-in on yelp and they were pretty good as well. The drinks were awesome, I got a Hennessy and Prosecco cocktail and it was delicious. It was a great dinner, but meals were extremely over priced. Good for a special occasion because of the atmosphere.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Excellent brunch spot! Delicious food, comfortable atmosphere, beautiful views of Manhattan, and thoughtful service. We tried the chicken and waffles, crab benedict, and burger, and cleaned all our plates easily. Furthermore, the Pisqueya hot sauce that they provide is incredible! When I asked how I could get my own bottle, the waiter personally walked me to their cafe, where they sell that hot sauce by the bottle. I couldn't recommend this spot more and will definitely be coming back again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Decided to venture out to Brooklyn today and visited The Osprey! The ambiance is very nice and we opted for the outdoor seating since it's a beautiful day.  

I ordered the salmon avocado toast and my hubby got the salmon scrambled eggs with potatoes. Both were amazing and came out super fast. The service here is incredible.

Would def recommend if in the area!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"This is a review just for drinks at the bar, which are highly highly worth it even at $18 per cocktail (we each just had one but others were having quite a few!). We actually meant to go to Harriet's on the rooftop but the line was too long and a storm was on the horizon, so it didn't seem worth it - that's when we stumbled upon the osprey (in same hotel - 1 Hotel Brooklyn). We sat at the bar for about 2 hours - they never hurried us out. Ambience is chic and low key (see photos). Each cocktail we had was unique and fun. The winning cocktail was All Hans on Deck, which my partner called ""a spa in your mouth"" with cucumber, egg white, and gin. I had the Osprey with fresh lavender and Vodka - definitely the prettiest but not as good on flavor as the other two.

French fries were solid but nothing super special.

Also great people watching :)",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"It's my first time here and I'm glad my friend suggested we check this place out! It's part of the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge - I walked in and found my way to The Osprey. I was starving so we decided to share the crab Benedict, the chicken & waffle and the chicken salad sandwich. My crab benedict was surprisingly my favorite. The hashbrown and the eggs and the crab just meshed so perfectly. The chicken too was boneless and it was perfect with the syrup. I was getting full so I only had one bite of the chicken salad sandwich - it wasn't interesting enough for me to finish but I wasn't impressed with it. The ambiance is great! Spacious seats, full length windows, they have a long common table too if that's your thing. Bathrooms are coed.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"What is an Osprey.. According to wikipedia. "" -- also called sea hawk, river hawk, and fish hawk -- is a diurnal, fish-eating bird of prey with a cosmopolitan range. It is a large raptor, reaching more than 60 cm in length and 180 cm across the wings. ""

This Restaurant gives it a whole new definition.
We made reservations for 715 and arrived at 7 and was able to be seated sooner.  definitely do the valet parking here is scarce and paying for it is worth it regardless of ticket or tow you may endure.

The weather was so beautiful we couldn't pass up sitting outside in the beautifully decorated patio.   The tables are nicely set apart where you dont feel cramped and dont really hear fellow patron conversations.  The beautiful edison bulbs line the patio for the summer vibes feeling. The Staff was on their A+ game. Someone was always tending to our table refilling water, clearing plates  constantly checking.

The Food: Gosh where to begin?
Shisito Peppers generous portion and the hint of lime genius! we lucked out with no spicy ones (although i wouldn't mind it)
Brussel Sprouts crispy  crunchy
White gazpacho i was convinced it had coconut in it but the other flavors sure did fool me, loved that it was poured table side crab super tender and the bit of crunch from the marcona almonds heavenly
Tuna Tartare- WOW that is where i am leaving that at speechless
Heirloom tomato the stracciatella  and the tender tomatoes a perfect balance
Jo-Jo BBQ Skewers the Bao bun soft fluffy and i could eat a whole jar of the pickled vegetables
Long Island Duck this really blew me out of the park the creamed leeks i thought was mash potatoes but the cherries when eaten with the duck was a match made in heaven, move over oranges and ducks.
Coconut passion fruit first off such a beautiful presentation too pretty to eat and the different shades of yellow really engaged me to mix the flavors together and it went from sweet to tart to mango beautifully.
Shaved Ice and Berries aka Halo-Halo style Filipino dessert was a refreshing palate cleanser.
Campfire S'mores the only thing this was missing was a torch show, but the marshmallow was charred so nicely and the imitation of a white fire with marshmallow like logs genius, the perfect dipping vessel for the chocolate cremuex (similar to a mousse).
Sandeman Ruby Port i am now a fan of this and will be stocking up because it hit the spot after  indulging in all the amazing food
what a wonderful dining experience  

The food is best shared 2-3 people tapas style in my opinion worth it to enjoy more variety.

Now i need a new definition of an Osprey...Sophisticated Hawk

shout of to Denny for him and the other waitstaff really going above and beyond with attentiveness and warm hospitality.  Hats off to Chef Denevin for his creative mind and playful twist with delicious food.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Really enjoyed coming here to have a birthday meal with friends. The service is really great and friendly. They knew it was my birthday and they gave me a complimentary dessert!! Super nice! The food is also super good! I got the duck dish and it was so tender and flavorful!! Their panne cotta dish is amazingggg. All in all worth it! The hotel is also really pretty. The only weird thing is that the bathroom they have which is shared with the hotel, it only had one working sink...out of the 6 sinks.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Really enjoyed the ambiance and the food here! I love the location in Miami and this one is so beautiful too.

We sat outsides in the back area. The pre fixed meals with two courses for $26 was very reasonable. My mom got the BBQ skewers and the cauliflower.

I ordered the seafood cobb salad and it was freakin delicious!

The service was ok, definitely found ourselves asking for help multiple times but would still enjoy coming back here! Cheers!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Once in a while, you come across a restaurant about which you have nothing bad to say, even if you're in a complaining mood and try to wrack your brain...The Osprey is one of those restaurants.

We went for Restaurant Week, which has been one of the only occasions where the items on that limited menu are actually the exact things I would normally get if I was going for dinner on any other night.

The first thing that gets your attention is the stunning view of the NYC skyline and the Brooklyn Bridge. The restaurant is also housed inside the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge, which is a gorgeous space in and of itself; they seem to really blend nature and modernity in their decor (there's a full ivy wall inside) which I loved right away. The bathrooms are located outside the restaurant so you have to go through the lobby and down a long flight of stairs to find a unisex communal bathroom. Initially I got lost on my way and was a bit thrown off when I saw a random dude washing hands two sinks down from me, but the space is very clean and maintains the same earthy feel as the rest of the hotel.

Now on to the food, my friend and I had the following off the RW menu:
-Hen of the Woods
-Venison Tartare
-Diver Scallops
-Murray's Farm Chicken
-Citrus Cheesecake
-S'mores (in a jar)

And we got an extra item: pumpkin brioche with sea salt and vanilla bean butter.

All of these items were amazing, and I could go on and on for paragraphs, so I'll just stick to the stand-out elements for me:
1. If you're not the biggest fan of mushrooms at the outset, hen of the woods will make you a believer.
2. Venison tartare is fresh and lemony tasting, and is everything you'd ever want when eating mashed up raw meat.
3. The chicken is great by itself but what really seals the deal is the cornbread pudding which is packed with herbs. I'm always a sucker for good cornbread but I recognize and acknowledge the greats when I taste them.
4. Whenever I have an option to order s'mores in a jar at a restaurant, I seize the opportunity and they never disappoint.
5. The pumpkin brioche, which is a random side dish, was the winner of the night--it's sweet and savory, looks like it's been prepared in a cute little tin, and the vanilla butter is to die for. If I could have taken 10 brioches and a vat of butter home with me, I would have. On second thought, I now know what I have to look forward to next time...

Also: special shout-out to the staff (both greeters and waiters) for being so courteous and helpful throughout our visit. All in all, this is a great spot that I'll be recommending to all my friends.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Been meaning to check out The Osprey since it opened since I work nearby, but never felt a need to splurge on my lunch break. But, as everyone knows, Restaurant Week is the perfect excuse to convince yourself that you're not actually spending that much money, and then realizing you're actually spending more than you thought after the fact.

The RW meal I crafted for myself was basically a cow before and after. My first course was the beef tartare, and my main was their cheeseburger.

The beef tartare was fine, but didn't really pop in terms of freshness or flavors. There was a ton of it though.

The burger was a double patty with melty cheddar and caramelized onions, and was delicious. Super messy, and with a giant basket of fries (which were also really good).

I would come back for the burger.

I also ordered a whiskey cocktail since I was sitting at the bar, but it took a while since they had to go to the stockroom multiple times for specific ingredients. It was good though, and the bartender was apologetic.

If you're in the area, staying at the 1 Hotel, or generally want a semi-fancy meal, The Osprey is a pretty solid bet.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Such a beautiful location in Dumbo! I went here for a birthday brunch around 12pm. It wasn't packed, but had a decent crowd for a freezing Saturday morning.

Someone at the table let the waiter know it was my birthday, and he gave all five of us a round of free cocktails! That was SO nice, and they were all insanely delicious. For food, we all split the cauliflower and ordered individual entrees. I had the (pricey) seafood Cobb salad... and it was ok. For almost $30, I had higher up expectations for the freshness of the seafood and the other toppings. The corn on the salad was very, very gummy and over cooked.

Overall, I'd definitely return for lunch/dinner for some amazing cocktails and to sample their more savory dishes.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"I will start with the only downside - expect to pay Dumbo, waterfront hotel with a gorgeous view price. Aside from that, get ready for an amazing dining experience! We were fortunate enough to try out this wonderful restaurant on the last day of restaurant week, therefore taking advantage of a great deal and enjoying some of their best menu picks. The atmosphere is cozy but modern, perfect for a romantic date night by the water - and did I mention the breathtaking views?? We were seated by the outside patio on a beautiful summer evening and it was just the perfect setting.

Our server Chris was so sweet, very attentive while giving us space to enjoy each other, and knowledgeable about the menu and wine list.  

Every bite of our food was flavorful and fresh. My husband's NY Strip was seasoned deliciously and cooked to perfection. I loved the crispy sear on my Faroe Island salmon and the sides complemented our entrees perfectly. Special mention goes to the delectable s'mores dessert that was truly the cherry on top of our amazing meal!

On a Friday evening, the place got busy quick and we were grateful to have a reservation and get there early. However, the influx of people may have been the reason for our entrees taking longer than expected to come out. My husband and I did not mind the extra quality time on our date and Chris made it even more enjoyable by apologizing for the long wait and refilling our wine glasses free of charge. What a great experience - and staff here are to thank! Especially since we started our evening upstairs at Harriett's and let's just say the staff there left more to be desired in terms of customer service and simply good people skills.

Thank you, The Osprey, for an amazing evening! We will certainly be back, especially whenever another promotion comes along!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Have been to 1 Hotel for their roof top bar several times since they opened and the service is excellent. It's cozy and of course, the view is spectacular. Cocktails are really delicious too. The manager up there and his staff give such amazing service.

Also went to The Osprey for lunch today for the first time with my family.  The menu is so so much better now that Denevin Miranda is Head Chef there.  Thank you Elvis Escobar - you and your staff treated us so well. We will be back with more friends and family for sure!  Cannot wait to go for dinner next time! Excited to see what delicious food will be on menu.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The Osprey is just one of those places... how can I put this? (strokes beard).
My Queen and I are a couple of food ""snobs"" who enjoy superb service, flavorful food, stellar bar interactions, and deserts that are overly orgasmic. Bottle that all up and you'll have THE OSPREY!

First visit:
It was one of our exploratory weekends and we'd just had a very bad brunch at another restaurant. We opted to have desert elsewhere and began our yelp search, which quickly led us both to The Osprey. Being that w just wanted desert and a couple drinks, we opted to grab the bar oppose to a table... keep in mind this was over the summer, so the outside tables were brimming with excitement and sunshine.
As we settled into our highchairs, a warm greeting came our way by the bartender who we later discovered would be moving out of NY soon... her name escapes me. After hearing about our bad brunch, she immediately suggested the Campfire S'more and the Coconut Passion Fruit, she also suggested we pair it with Smoke and Daggers and ...and the doctor said... all great choices.

Despite my love for my go-to drink (Old Fashioned), the Smoke and Daggers was surprisingly delicious and the Dewars added an expected layer of smoke which was complimented by the orange peel. My Queen loved her ...and the doctor said... which she highlighted as a must have when ordering the Coconut Passion Fruit.

The Coconut Passion Fruit is a coconut mousse with passion fruit, macaron, and a mango sorbet. With each spoonful you're slapped in the face with cold but balanced flavors. I was more a fan of the Campfire S'more as the cinnamon ice cream was a great compliment to the warm and chocolaty smore. I had the opportunity to enjoy both deserts but the smore came out on top... maybe due to my love of chocolate but who knows. Lol

Second visit:
Dinner time came upon us and we hadn't cooked. What's a Black Excellence couple to do? Yup! Go to The Osprey.

After realizing that dinner time drew nearer and neither my Queen nor I made moves to cook, I secretly booked a table for two at one of her top 5 favorite restaurant in New York (top 2 in Brooklyn)(see list ""Recommend Whole Heart under my collection). Reservation was set for 8pm we were on our way. Oddly enough, My Queen thought I was going to propose to her this night and was very jittery (insert sinister smile... details to come later concerning this matter). We arrive and received the same warm welcome from our initial visit, I am a creature of habit and consistency is very important to me, so this made me smile.

Finally, at our seats, we were able to see the night sky and the restaurant had a low hum from all the conversations around us. Inn short the ambiance was borderline perfect. Our waiter was prompt, informative, and attentive without hovering (another plus in my book). He ran through the menu, taking time to identify items that contained dairy or gluten, he also suggested a perfect wine pairing for our meals... it's like they're all trained in pairings here.
We began with the Hen of the woods which was a well-prepared mushroom salad with chimichurri remoulade and what tasted like a balsamic glaze. Next up... oh wait I almost forgot to add that I had my Old Fashioned and My Queen had a Pinot noir. Next up was the Faro Island Salmon with a side of crushed potatoes for my Queen while I enjoyed the Long Island Duck with a side roasted asparagus. The salmon was perfect... crispy skin on top and evenly cooked resting on what looked to be a cream sauce. My duck was even better than expected. Evenly cooked, slight hint of coffee and went exceptionally well with the asparagus.

Guess what we had for dessert? Lol If you were paying attention then you'll know what I ordered and yes, My Queen ordered similarly to our first visit as well.

All in all, these two experiences promoted us to add The Osprey to list. Give this place a try and please share your experience with me.

Absolutely all dishes that we ordered - food excellent, had good attention for each details: plate, representation of the dish, colors combos  and tastes it's something . Location and views it's incredibly for everyone (local or visitors) , Service very professional.
I highly recommend this place",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The Osprey has renewed my faith in eating out in NY. My friend and I went to try their Restaurant Week menu, and ended up ordering several other items just to try them all since every bite was so delicious and surprising.

Our server was genial, attentive but unobtrusive, and very helpful with suggestions. Since the Restaurant Week menu portions are smaller than their usual entrees, we decided to order and share each dish. Seriously, the flavors of each item were so on point and bright, it was amazing. For instance, NY strip steak with spinach and onions- yawn, right? But the steak was perfectly tender with a bite in the spice rub, the spinach was barely wilted so it still had body, and they brûléed the pearl onions. Or their hen of the woods mushroom app, with a mustard base was both pretty and earthy, and so tasty. And their s'mores desert, with hard meringue edges and marshmallow cream spiced with coffee and dark chocolate mousse, velvety and rich.

The interior of the restaurant is wide open, with high ceilings and a pretty hanging planter and light arrangement over the main dining area. The bar was well appointed and had comfortable looking stools, and the patio looking into the park was gorgeous. We had a table by the window wall onto the park, and it was simply a stunning oasis from street traffic and general noise.

I can't wait to come back soon.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

In just few words... go to eat there!

The osprey has terrific service, amazing food and drinks. While we were enjoying dinner it was so beautiful to admire the environmental interior/ exterior  design.

Adam our waiter was very caring for our table. He definitely made sure we had a great time.

Amazing energy!!!!

I highly recommend to go visit The Osprey especially now for restaurant week! You will get to eat fine quality food   And try more of the fantastic drinks.

The Osprey,"Update: 8/5/19
I was approached by Sterling the General Manager of The Osprey who made it his duty to make sure amends were made to my initial experience.  I can gladly say that I am beyond impressed by the professionalism of the staff and how aesthetically pleasing the establishment is.  Now let's talk food and drinks!  I tried both the ""Osprey"" and ""Smoke and Daggers"", the two choices were delightful and well crafted.  All the food was made fresh when ordered, tasty, and meats tender.  The salmon was not over cooked , the steak savory, and hands down the Tuna Tartare was my favorite indulgence for the night!  Highly recommended establishment.  My date and I continued our evening at the rooftop for a few more drinks and had a lovey experience.  Special thank you to

Brussels sprouts were amazing. Wild boar ragu was bland. I hate to leave less than three stars since it's a new restaurant. So I won't but things need to be sorted out. The service and atmosphere made up for the entree I had. But for the price point the food should be better. All four of us felt that way about the
food/pricing.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Even when looking out the windows all you see if trees, it has a farm house feeling, the waiters & waitresses wear aprons. We were seated right away, and service was great, everyone was super polite, and kept on top of everything, making sugar orange juice, and coffee was always refilled. We had the usual, eggs, bacon, breakfast potatoes, and toast. Of course everything was organic, the eggs were basic eggs, the bacon was delicious & very thick, the potatoes were delicious, they had Parmesan cheese on them, toast was also good, just wish the butter wasn't so hard. We definitely had a nice relaxing breakfast before leaving.

The Osprey,"Came across the Osprey as a surprise for my birthday. Located at the ground floor of a hotel, the Osprey is busy and located near the Brooklyn Bridge area. Atmosphere was nice and open and featured a variety in terms of crowd. Decor is very modern and was very clean. I started off my order with the Smoke and Daggers (Hibiki, Hennessy, Antica, Dry Curaçao, and Orange). The cocktails were pretty good but higher priced at 18 dollars a piece. Appetizer, I order roasted Shishito peppers which was pretty good. And lastly I ordered Steak Frites as an entree. I had high hopes but it was mediocre. It came out lukewarm and wasn't cooked to the right temperature. Overall this place has some good features but it didn't wow me especially for the price point. If I could, I would give it a 3.5 with the strong point mainly being the cocktails.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

On the second day, we decided to eat breakfast. I ordered the avocado toast and country breakfast. The food was good but over priced (it's inside the hotel) and the service was very slow. It took 30mn to get our food. They forgot one of our drink orders and brought out the wrong food.

Since then, we've been back with visitors from out of town twice. Consistently good food and great atmosphere. We've only been when it's warm out, though, so maybe not quite the same appear in the winter. They have a giant outdoor patio that doesn't feel like Brooklyn (or a city) at all... nestled in the trees of the park along the East River. They have a few dishes that are fun to share - we've tried the wagyu short ribs, steak, and most recently I got the duck. Like I said, everything has been delicious. Oh, and the Brussels Sprouts!

I wanted to pick somewhere with a nice view and that's all The Osprey delivered, a view and good service. The food was garbagé... well at-least what I ordered. I got the steak with 2 sides and everything was below average. Just salty and not flavorful AND it was about $125. What a waste of money and sadly disappointed.

The Osprey,I went here for my anniversary about a month ago. The restaurant itself is beautiful when you walk in. It's attached to a hotel so the lobby is though a hallway to the left. We were seated right away in a table outside. They made the table more romantic by adding a personal lantern to our spot. The waiter was very nice and our food was absolutely delicious. I recommend the salmon and the warm olive appetizer. When we were finished with our meal our waiter allowed us to go to the top of the hotel with free entry with our paid receipt. It was a great way to end the night with spectacular views and great photos. Only thing I would change is the noise from the very near by busy street and brooklyn bridge park noise.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I had the avocado toast with poached eggs and my husband had the chicken and waffles. The avocado toast was great. It had fresh salmon and caviar. My husband's chicken and waffles was great too. The chicken was tender and spiced well. The waffle was a bit dry and not as fluffy as we'd like but overall it was tasty.

We stopped in around 5, nearby restaurants had happy hour with $7 wines, $5 beers, not the Osprey! $16 wines at Osprey, bar food menu seemed high and not interesting.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,Stephan!  You are the most attentive host!  We had a sizable group and you made sure we were seated together. Our glasses stayed full and our bellies well-fed.  Thank you...Cheryl (The Alexander Group-Restaurant Week),5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"This place is all about location, which is truly worth coming to. Brooklyn bridge area is beautiful. Restaurant itself is overrated and simply not good. Service deserves -2 stars worst service ever. My recommendations is... get coffee next door don't waist $ here",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Great staff, excellent food, cool vibes, lots of plants

Shout out to Sterling and Adam who took care of us. Hospitality 100",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Amazing location. Beautiful views. Mediocre food. Mediocre service.

The starters were great. We especially enjoyed the beet hummus and charcuterie platter.

Dessert is also yummy!

But...
---shoe string fries, looked yummy but too salty
--table bread is sliced sandwich bread vs baguette
--i ordered a French Martini and the bartender had never heard of the drink; I offered to Google it for the waiter when he came back 20 min later without my drink to ask for more details about the drink
--burger came out cold, had to send it back to heat up
--sauce for muscles was unbareable; sent back and ordered something different which took so long I gave up and moved on to dessert

My advice: grab a drink and dessert at the bar. Don't eat there until they do something drastically different.

I do hear brunch is pretty good but hard to trust.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"As a local, and one who works/lives nearby, the prices here are steep, IMO. But, our server was bubbly, friendly, and had great energy for first thing in the morning - there is something to be said for solid service! Now how about the food? The avocado toast w/ an egg was decadent and a solid choice for breakfast. We also were given complimentary hot apple cider shots (yum) and my friends ordered some of their green energy juice (I didn't have any, but they loved it).

The view of BK bridge park and plenty of sunlight also add to the ambiance. I think this makes for a solid work breakfast location!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The bar staff was lovely and so attentive, I will for sure come back, they made me feel at home and welcomed my off the menu request for a espresso martini which was to die for. I would recommend here to anyone visiting dumbo!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Honestly not sure why they have poor ratings. The food was delicious, service was above average. Water was constantly refilled. Pricing is average for the area and even cheaper than some local spots. It's right on the park, offers valet, and beautiful decor. I would definitely recommend going and I would go back.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"This is probably the worst service I have received in any restaurant in New York. Whenever I read reviews like this I tend to disregard them and think they are exaggerating, but I hardly ever write a review, and when I do is usually never bad. But I felt compelled to, because it was particularly bad, both the service AND the food.

I had made a reservation to celebrate my birthday two weeks in advance. I asked for a table in the center, but they gave me a table by a wall. I asked them if they could change us to an empty table in the middle (that had just gotten emptied up) but they said they couldn't in a very condescending way, giving nonsense explanations.
So then the server tried to convince us to sit at another table with a better view, and treated me like a baby trying to explain to me why that table was better than a table in the middle.

They gave us the menu and left. For about 30 minutes and never came back. They didnt bring the drinks menu. We had to ask for it. We had to call her to get our order for drinks and appetizers. Our cocktails took 30 minutes to arrive. Then we had to call them again to order our main entrees. Let me stop for a second and go over the food:

The pasta was BLAND and TASTELESS. There was no such thing as spicy sausage in it. The squash was not properly cooked. The worst most tasteless pasta Ive had.

The branzino was nothing out of this world.

The charred brussel sprouts were so soggy. It's hard to mess up charred anything. Very disappointing.

They didnt give us honey in the cheese platter. I reminded her. She never brought it.

The only yumy thing was whitefish pate which I couldve bought at the supermarket.

Scallops were okay.

On top of all of this, not once did anyone stop to ask if everyfhing was okay. Not a single person poured more wine when needed. We had no idea how much wine was left in the bottle.

It was my birthday and the girl just gave us the dessert with the candles and walked away. The staff here is probably the rudest and most non efficient people I have met.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Although this restaurant received some mixed reviews, I decided to try it anyway for my boyfriend's birthday- I am glad I went with my gut.

First let's talk visual, I am a sucker for a beautifully designed restaurant. The Osprey's decor is breathtaking, perfect for any special occasion or date night. You have an option of indoor or outdoor seating, we opted for indoor and from our table we were able to enjoy the view of outside.

Decor isn't the only reason I gave them 5 stars, the service was spot on. The staff genuinely seemed like they were happy to be there, not only based on how they interacted with the customers but each other as well.

Now to the most important part... the food. Let me preface that my boyfriend is a very simple eater (meat and potatoes kind of guy) and doesn't usually like to try new things. He order the berkshire pork chop w/ Heirloom Apple Sauce, Swiss Chard, Hard Cider Jus and cleaned his plate, he enjoyed every bite! I had the Branzino and it was delicious.

If you are on the fence based on the mixed reviews, don't be. Definitely give them a try, I don't think you will regret it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The staff here really know what they are doing! My parents stayed in Hotel 1 where The Osprey is located so we chose to have dinner here due to convenience. This was not only a good choice because of the food, but the service was brilliant too.

I sat at the bar waiting for my parents to arrive and had a great experience with Luis, the barman, while we spoke about different cocktails we like to make. When my parents arrived and we sat at our table, the waitress who looked after us was just as engaging. She my parents with a different level of respect and had a bit more fun with me. It was perfect for showing how to engage properly with different people at the same table.

The food was delicious and so was the wine. We had such an amazing experience that we chose to come back here with more people later that weekend. The waiter was also lovely that night but gave us a little more space since we were obviously having fun catching up.

This place is on my ""Go To"" list when taking friends out to dinner in Brooklyn. We will be back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Is there a 6th star I can add to this?!?! Seriously. You NEED to check this place out if you're ever in the neighborhood. It's a beautiful, romantic, amazing place to dine, celebrate or just chill with a glass of wine (or in my case single malt scotch)  

Fist impressions-I was blown away by the beautiful decor and the lighting of the spaces. This restaurant was so well thought out; so pleasing to the senses.

We were seated near the Wall of glass windows where we could see the amazing skyline...beautifully lit up and so very romantic.

Seating: beautiful patio area, bar seating and indoor seating

Service: EXCELLENT!!! Fun, prompt, attentive but not hovering

Parking: unknown as we took an Uber

Food:
Here is what my husband and I ordered:

Lamb duo
Prime rib
Brussels sprouts
2Clary Ranch- Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)

EVERYTHING was perfectly cooked, tender, seasoned beautifully and was an absolute delight to the taste buds. It was an anniversary to remember and a place my husband and I will surely be visiting again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,Love it! And can't wait to return.  I had the scallops and a glass of white wine - the scallops were cooked perfectly and was the exact portion size I needed.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The experience here was horrible.  Located in the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge, I was eagerly anticipating my first dining experience here.  I made reservations for five a day in advance.  I dropped off my guests and the proceeded to valet parking at the hotel.  Well, no parking.  The hotel lot was filled due to a wedding.  Mind you there is no street parking.  When I went to back in to ask what to do, I noticed they had hastily prepared a table for us in the bar area near the door because the main dining room was full.  (Did I mention I made reservations a day in advance?) Strike two.  Strike three was that the bathroom was located what seemed like a half mile away down in the basement area.  We left.  Don't bother going here.  Over-priced menu and no clue or class.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"This restaurant is on the ground level of 1 Hotel on Furman street, so there is a grand view of the Brooklyn bridge at most of the tables inside. The bathroom for the restaurant is shared with the hotel as well, so heads up, you'll have to leave and take some stairs to get there.

The staff was incredible- from host to complimentary coat check, to servers- everyone was on their A game and beyond friendly.

The food itself was good too, started out with the cauliflower salad, and tried the mushroom risotto as well as the seared scallops.  The cauliflower was cooked just right, still a little crispy and came with grapes and mint with turmeric that that made it a very crisp and refreshing dish. The risotto was bombbbb, very soul-warming on a cold and snowy night.  However, I was glad that we had the scallops as well for a protein and more of a hearty meal to share. The scallops were so buttery they practically fell off my fork and back into the white beans they were sitting on.  It brings a tear to my eye thinking about them now.

Cocktails could have been a little more balanced. I had the 'Brooklyn,' which went against all the classic Brooklyn cocktail's ingredients and used rum, but I thought I would give it a try. The lime and bitters did not balance out the sweeter amaro and rum, making the drink fall short and not blend well in the glass itself, where there was some separation. The 'Osprey' was visually appealing with some lavender buds on top, and was a much more balanced drink.

I recommend going there for dinner so you'll have a nice lit up view of the city- a great place to bring friends visiting from out of town that's affordable and still has you feeling like a million bucks.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,*THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON SERVICE AT THE BAR ONLY* I've been here twice and I am in Love! The ambiance and decor transports you to a 'fancy restaurant off the coast... in some other cleaner & nicer country'. The staff are very personable and professional. Both Layla and Isaiah are masters at their craft behind the bar. All three bartenders and the bar hand work extremely well together. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone but probably not for dinner as the menu is lacking in variety. The location is an added bonus and well hidden from the tourist invasion that is Brooklyn Bridge Park.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Pros: Beautiful space; food was pretty good
Cons: Overpriced; they seem to treat families with kids like lepers

Went here for brunch on a Saturday with our well-behaved two-year-old. The restaurant was about a quarter full, but they stuck us in a dark booth back by the kitchens. We asked a couple times if we could switch to one of the dozen or so empty tables nearer to the windows. They refused, telling us that they ""had a lot of reservations"" that day. (We were also there on a reservation.)

We looked around and realized we were in a sort of Child Ghetto -- 4 other families with kids were clustered back in the same row of booths. 90 minutes into the meal, the tables that the waitress had claimed were reserved were still empty. (I took a picture. It's ridiculous.)

Despite the bad service, the food here is decent. I had chicken and waffles, and enjoyed it. It's an expensive brunch, even by NYC standards, but I suppose you're paying for the surroundings, which are in fact beautiful, so no complaints there.

TLDR: This place is probably fine if you're in a group of all adults... but there are a lot of better options if you want to bring your kids somewhere.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The service was very inattentive and the food was really bland. Branzino - bland. Chitare - bland.

I had to send back the ""steak tartare"" aka the hamburger twice and I still got charged for it.

I wouldn't go back.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Went to the Osprey for a family brunch. It is located in the Brooklyn One Hotel. Have no fear if you drive over because there is valet service.  We were seated in the front area by the entrance, thought I would have preferred being more interior.  The decor was fresh and classy. We sat next to a couple who was dining with their pooch sitting beneath their table. The staff was nice, our waiter was accommodating. We got a few dishes to try. If you are looking to have fish and chips or chicken and waffles, in my opinion, this isn't your place. However they have a solid chicken sandwich with fries. The brunch is decent, but not as spectacular as I would have hoped it to be, especially with that location. Would I come back, sure, but would probably checkout other local offerings a first.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Oh my! What an incredible restaurant experience!
I came here Friday last week for lunch, right after my husband and I got married in the Court House.
We came with my mom and grandfather ( first time visiting NY from Norway) and my husbands sister, two kids and their father.

First of all, we came over an hour before our reservation. I did not call to let the restaurant know, I just showed up and explained myself to the host. ( With this I am not trying to recommend people to do what I did, as I have long experience working in food service and arriving over an hour before your reservation is just not cool!) BUT the hostess was the sweetest ever and was totally understanding and great.

Because of the occasion I had requested a nice table, and of course being this early I did not expect to get the same table they had reserved for us, but we were seated at our table almost right away!

The hostess offered to take our coats and let us park the stroller by the entrance. I dont think I have ever been been so kindly welcomed at a restaurant before.
The staff we passed while walking to our table congratulated us on our wedding which was very kind.

We got our seats, which was perfect. Gorgeous view and big enough for us all with the two kids.

Staff at the house had written us a beautiful congratulation-card - hangs on our fridge today!- and we were severed complimentary champagne for the occasion.
Like that was not enough to be blown away - my husband, me and my husbands siste are those ""annoying sober New Yorkers"" and when we turned down the champagne, our sweet server was totally respectful (major plus!) and offered us something else instead for the toast.

We then got two complimentary salads while waiting for what turned out to be THE BEST BURGERS ANYONE HAD EVER HAD IN NYC! AMAZING!

After the most amazing lunch, with the best service anyone had ever had in NYC ( or basically ever!) we were guided up ( I belive his name was Elvis, but apologizes if I got the name wrong) to the incredible roof for a showing and we got some insane wedding photos with the best NY view! BTW he took great care of us during the whole stay, checked in with us and was just absolutely amazing!

THANK YOU everyone at The Osprey for making our special day feel so extra special.

We will most definitely be back, and no doubt this is our go-to when our international friends/family are coming to visit!

( oh, and if you are doing a Court House wedding. I highly recommend you walk Brooklyn Bridge with your crew before ending up at the Osprey for lunch or dinner. Make sure to go up to see the rooftop view and snap some photos!)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,Chef Denevin at The Osprey has a variety of delicious food on the menu Our dinner started with exploring the scrumptious appetizers and then went thru the main dishes and we left very satisfied,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,This place is beautiful! The inside decoration are amazing. Food was good but not amazing! Everything was delicious though! I just expected more from a place like The Osprey.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"We booked this place for a NYE dinner for 3 people at 9:15. And this was by far one of the worst ""fine-dining"" experiences of our lives.
1) That night had a special and very limited prix fix tasting menu of 8 tiny dishes at $180 per person. This situation wasn't mentioned anywhere when placing the reservation. We only found out upon being seated.
2) When we explained to the manager that the prix fix and it's pricing was never discussed and had we known we would have booked some place else and now at 9:30 pm on NYE we are unable to do that, she simply said there is nothing they could do and we had to oblige with the menu since they ""tried to call as many people as they could to let them know the dinner would be prix fix"". (She was also pretty condescending during that conversation.)
3) We asked to speak to the general manager to see if we could order individual items from the menu without having to do the full tasting course. He then also said he couldn't do anything about and would have to escalate it to the chef and speak with him .... we insisted he do so. Finally after about 45 minutes of this travesty the chef agreed to serve the courses individually at a per item price (that the waitress was supposed to inform us on) and the courses would be tasting menu appetizer size).
4) we ended up ordering 2 courses each and a drink or two. At the end of the dinner our bill came out to be $114 per person, which is a gross overcharge. Provided that the tasting menu of 8 courses and I believe 3 drinks came in to be $180 per person. So we paid 2/3 or the price for 2 of the items out of the menu.
5) the waitress never broke down individual prices to us as offered by the GM - just asked what we are ordering. The food took about 25-30 for each course. And everyone was extremely condescending and clearly annoyed with us throughout the whole meal.
5) And last but not least, I woke up at 4am with a severe food poisoning and couldn't manage it for the next 3 hours. I would think it's a coincidence, but in this case - seems a bit too uncanny.
6) the 2 stars belong to the very sweet and welcoming bartender who made nice drinks and talked to us for the 30 min we waited for our table to be ready in the first place.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Went here for the first time the other day and didn't get a chance to look at the yelp reviews.  It was a hot day and a new place so we tried it.
We had a glass of wine and ordered the octopus appetizer to share.

The waitress said the octopus was the best dish off the raw bar even thought it was grilled.  We ordered and if that is the best they have on the raw bar, then that is not a good sign.  The octopus was almost hard to recognize among the beans and it was on top of some mayo based sauce which was not good at all.

I was very happy we did not order a full meal here and just ordered something to try and move on.  I will say the waitress was nice, the view is great but the restaurant was basically empty and now I know why.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"I had a very good breakfast at The Osprey! We visited the restaurant prior to our spa appointments. Loved the decor...openness is really inviting.

We were greeted and seated right away. Pleasant staff, super friendly, and also made great recommendations...
Pretty good choices on the menu for breakfast and below is what we selected -
Fontina & Thyme Biscuit - 2 biscuits
Egg White Frittata  -  came with wild mushroom, caramelized onions, my lover goat cheese :-), and greens
Moroccan Mint tea

All were GREAT!!! Totally satisfied with the food and the staff. I will definitely return to try their lunch and dinner.
Our waiter also spoke about the rooftop and the lounge that he recommended we visit in the spring, which we plan on doing.

Yep Yep Yep...check them out!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The location can't be beat unless, of course, it was 12 floors higher! The hotel The Osprey is located in (1Hotel Brooklyn Bridge) is GORGEOUS with a rustic modern vibe. Thick faux fur rugs waterfall down steps, concrete, wood, live walls...it's just gorge. Anyway, becknto the restaurant. The food was pretty darn good. The French Toast bread pudding with lemon curd and berries was kind of a favorite and the egg sandwich on brioche was a close second. I ordered the cauliflower, which was a little disappointing. It was a gorgeous dish, and it was tasty, but I think it lacked a bit. First, the cauliflower is pickled and then roasted. It only needed to be roasted. The tanginess was a little weird. Also, the curry sauce should've either been thicker or something more like curried polenta or sweet potato or something more along those lines. That said, I didn't regret ordering it, but, with every bite, I was thinking of what would make it better. I loved that it was a really healthy option!

The coffee was a little sour.

Overall, I would totally go back. The service was nice, great ambience (hello, a view of manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge as you step out!) and good, solid food. I wanted to try the cocktails, but it was a little early and I was headed straight to the airport after, but I see some gorgeous cocktails in yelp! Please check it out for me!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Getting brunch usually means paying a markup for eggs and carbs in exchange for ambience and cute pictures. But I felt like they took it a little too far here, even for NYC. Everything on the menu hovered around the $20 mark. I got the steak tartare because it was about the same price as the omelets and toasts. It was pretty good, but I wish they'd be a little more generous with the bread. The toast was gone by the time I finished about a third of the steak tartare. I waited 10 minutes to ask our server for some extra bread but he didn't come around so I ended up just eating the rest. Probably better for me anyway since I was still full from dinner the night before but having the option would've been nice.

There are better places to go for brunch if you want a view and ambience. I also wish we got more attentive service for the automatic 20% gratuity that was applied to our bill.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"So, while I love Yelp, I have to admit that I am not typically a contributing member of the community - meaning that I'm lazy and don't write a lot of reviews.  I really need to work on that.  Be that as it may, I had a rather odd experience at The Osprey the other night that I feel compelled to share.
For the most part, my wife and I and our dinner companions (old friends) enjoyed ourselves: the setting is great (we sat outside as the night was nice and inside was a bit loud), the drinks were top-notch (truly, all high-marks on that front), and the food was also very strong: app's were good, entrees very good, dessert was great. But, we did have a weird experience with one particular starter: the ""Chickpea Stew.""  All of us on that night are fans of all the ingredients as described on the menu, and particularly of chickpeas.  However, there was nary a chickpea to be found, in any form, in this dish.  There were no whole chickpeas lurking in the bottom of the bowl, there were no dried chickpeas as a garnish, and neither were there any pulverized chickpeas as part of the stew.  Mind you, the stew was good: the flavor was good, there were other items in the stew that we liked (carrots for example, kale, etc.), but alas, no evidence of chickpeas.  I think that most would agree that this is odd, in and of itself, but, the plot thickens, and it gets weirder, as it were.  Eventually, we felt compelled to point this out to and ask our server about it.  We did, and her response I shall paraphrase as follows: this particular dish was in the process of being phased-out, was ultimately going to be removed from the menu, and therefore, not all of the ingredients were being acquired any longer and were therefore missing from the dish... In other words, there were not, in fact, any chickpeas in the ""Chickpea Stew"" because there were no chickpeas to put in it, because the dish is going to go the way of the Dodo (at least as far as The Osprey is concerned - sorry for the pun.)  Truly, one of the most bizarre things we have ever heard from a restaurant employee, and as a direction of restaurant management.
All in all, aside from the ""Chickpea-sans-chickpeas Stew"" we enjoyed ourselves and our meal.  But if you want a chickpea of some kind when going to The Osprey, you'd be well served to make a pit-stop at a grocery store around the corner beforehand and smuggling some in.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"I was looking for a restaurant with a nice view and I found this amazing place .  Very fancy and the service was on top of everything . I dont remember the name of the guy but he ( I guess he was Indian) was so helpful about everything that we were asking him . The menu didn't have that much options ( American food burgers and stuff) but they made some pasta for me (even though it wasn't part of the menu )wich made me feel special  . I got the tequila sunrise cocktail and it was amaizing !! The prices were to high but thinking that was at Brooklyn bridge and all that fancy around yeah it's acceptable
Loved the lunch in here .",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The scallops entre was delicious and super fresh. The 5 scallops itself were a decent size. We also had the branzino, which was also good. I was disappointed that the duck entre, which was on the website menu, was not on the menu. My friend said the porkchop was the best. I didn't get to try that this time.

The osprey cocktail was delicious. The bartender made my friend a mocktailx which also tasted pretty good.

The Osprey,Really nice brunch spot in Brooklyn in the 1 Hotel. Great food and service. Really cool view of Manhattan and the waterfront. Portions were a little small for the price but overall worth it and would definitely recommend!,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"TL;DR:
- food was fresh, healthy, decently big portion sizes for prices around $20
- ambiance is very hipster cozy industrial modern
- some menu items disappointing (poached eggs weren't silky soft, seemed like they were prepped hours before; ""avocado"" was more of a pureed paste/spread rather than the fresh avocado I expected)
- over 25 minute wait to get food
- our waiter was rude

My first impression of the building was that it looks more like it belongs in Seattle than Brooklyn -- lots of wood, oxidized metal, and concrete, and feeling fairly new and sterile despite the already-stained leather chairs and booths. We had a reservation and were seated promptly.

Overall the food was fresh-tasting and well-presented, but also somewhat bland. The portion sizes were decently big for what we ordered. The salmon eggs Benedict was good, but had only a drizzle of hollandaise instead of being doused in it like a typical Benedict. The pumpkin pancakes were huge, with a delicious blueberry topping. The ancient grain bowl had a good amount of bacon but the ""avocado"" was really more like guacamole -- mostly pureed to a liquid/paste with some small chunks of avocado. The chicken and breakfast sandwiches were nice and big.

The service was distinctly mediocre. When asked what kind of tea they had, our waiter seemed kind of annoyed and said it was on the menu...but it turns out it actually wasn't on this particular menu (Fall 2018 Brunch). Even though none of our dishes needed to be made to order (and all of the poached eggs seemed like they had been cooked hours earlier), it took more than 25 minutes for the food to be served. The waiter didn't ask if we wanted to split the check, and rudely brought it to the table when we were all in the middle of eating (even though there were plenty of extra tables). However there were at least 7 other waiters/servers in the restaurant so it doesn't seem fair to judge the whole place based on this one guy.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Osprey located inside the beautiful 1Hotel is just that beautiful. It is an absolutely incredible looking space. Every single inch of the building is beautiful.

However, the food and service just aren't competitive at their price point. The drinks start at $15 before tax so expect to spend $17 per drink and they are larger than average.

Its NYC I can get past that. I can maybe even get pass the wait staff not being very attentive and forgetting to bring some drink orders. What I cant get pass is how ill conceived the food was. My cauliflower small plate was beautiful but bland. It needed seasoning especially salt. I ordered the Branzino and again a beautiful dish. But the fish was oddly a little bitter, the lentils were forgettable, thankfully the salad on top offered some acidity. No one at my table except for the person that ordered the chicken and the pork chop were wowed. Everyone else was disappointed.

Its not like the food was awful its just if I pay $17 for cauliflower and $30 for fish I am going to be a harsh critic if its not up to par.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"It was ok food!
server is good! but
very bad hostess at the front!
Not the Latina looking because she was awesome!
but the white lady!
Walked passed her 3 times never say a word no look no greet at the entrance!
going to the bathroom after ate. didn't even look  she never acknowledged me and my friend. Wow!!! She acknowledged different people after and before me too! Then the last time I passed there was another guy and he did acknowledge us but still not her! Wow!
I Don't wanna experience that ever again!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Location: It's great! I mean, what more could you want being right next to Brooklyn Bridge park with a view of the bridge and Manhattan skyline from the dining room. Restaurant is located within 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge in the back.

Ambiance: Beautiful, chill, and airy. The sandalwood scent they have in the hotel lobby is literally heaven. Feels ""upscale"" without the stuffiness. The numerous plants and wooden beam make for a very zen dining experience perfect for couples or small groups. It wasn't too noisy either so no need to shout to make conversation. Only minor issue was I felt the space between tables was a bit tight. We sat inside as it was way too hot outside when we went.

Service: Very good. Our server was personable, prompt for the most part, and helped me out with organizing a birthday surprise for my friend. It was a bit slow getting the check at the end though.

Food: AMAZING! Scallops were cooked perfectly with the MOST luscious grits underneath along with some candied bacon. So good, we ordered that twice. Other faves were the fries (tarragon mayo was bomb) and risotto. Not recommended is the branzino since the char was really overwhelming.

Drinks: Very good. I got the Starling which was fresh, crisp, and well balanced.

Overall: I would come back! They have a gorgeous and spacious patio in the back overlooking the bridge making it a great spot for a relaxing dinner or even apps and drinks with a view. The hotel itself is beautiful and the rooftop is a plus for after dinner drinks (different menu). Nice that it didn't feel ""clubby"" up there either.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"We came back, and we were sorely disappointed. Setting aside that pricing a rather modest glass of wine at $17 is a bit too much (particularly when you are not enjoying it with a view, due to a private party on the rooftop), we were ""served"" by five different people within the span of half an hour, apparently with nobody knowing what exactly they were doing. We had almost finished our wine before someone came to fill our water glasses for the first time. Really need to do better in the service department.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"I mean... dayum! This place is delicious!! Every! Damn! Time! And the service is incredible! I wish I could remember the server that hit on my friend but whatever his name is, he hooked us up with a few drinks too.. and some champagne! Bless your beautiful soul and thank you kindly! My experiences here have been awesome and I not only recommend it all the time, I go back every chance cus I get!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Parking is a bear at this place. Food and drinks are ridiculously good though.  Scenery of beautiful and hip patrons and employees also adds to the mystique of this under the bridge hotel/bar/restaurant.

Brought my mother in law here for mother's day and she had a grand time.  4 star experience that could be a 5 star if...they had more staff on hand  The stand in reservationist at the front gave us sass for moving tables they originally seated us right in front of a concrete pillar where you needed to squeeze into the seating (not everyone is a hipster with a size 30 waist)! Anyhow they gave us 90 minutes to eat our meal and leave since we moved tables but the place never filled up and they never bothered us about it, so why did they bother being Debbie downers to begin with?

They also ran out of ingredients for their signature Osprey cocktail.  We were able to order 3 and to be honest my guests would have ordered 6 more if they didn't run out of the ingredients, lol. Only one caveat that ribeye or was it sirloin dish had a miniscule amount of steak on it, maybe 4 ounces precooked that shrunk to about 3 ounces. It was a joke compared to the massive 10 or 12 ounce prime rib that was on my plate.  If the steak was prime and expensive then they should be charging more for it for a larger portion rather than serve an embarassingly miniscule portion. I get aged steak all the time from the same purveyor that does caters to Peter Luger, I pay $28 a pound for it.  So $45 for a dinky 3 ounce steak is a joke. Why not charge another $15 or so and have a normal portion?",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Beautifully decorated place on the lobby of the hotel, abit secluded from the pier. Let's just say both my friends drink and mine w matcha need some improvement! It looks so instagrammable but didn't please our taste buds! Oh and it's not cheap, over $15 a pop! The ambiance of the restaurant is airy and relaxed on a sunny Monday afternoon!

The Osprey,"Had the opportunity to visit the 1 Hotel and eat at The Osprey. What a gorgeous hotel inside and out and there's an amazing view of Manhattan and Statue of Liberty from the rooftop! We started our meal with Charcuterie, then I had the tasty Crab Benedict from the brunch menu and then the Coconut Passionfruit for dessert which was so refreshing and sweet. We had such a memorable experience with the beautiful view, delicious food, and excellent service from Elvis and the staff. We will definitely be back soon!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,Everything we ordered was tasty and the place is as described in the reviews here - bright and airy. I would recommend coming when it's sunny. It was a bit cloudy and foggy when I was there and chilly too so it was quiet out (less people watching ;p and couldn't see much of the skyline). Will definitely come back to try other dishes.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

My friends and I each had different dishes and drinks and while the flavors were strong (nothing mind blowing) what we continued to discuss even after we left was the service. It started raining right as we were leaving and the hostess even gave us umbrellas! Kudos to the entire staff!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I can't wait to go back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Came here for Sunday brunch. It wasn't crowded but there was a little bit of a wait. The area is spacious and beautifully decorated with outdoor seating as well. Keep in mind there is a different hostess for outdoor seating.

I ordered the Cauliflower dish. It was a perfect combination of light curry flavor with grape pieces for a hint of sweetness. I was pleasantly surprised by how fulfilling this healthy dish was.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The Osprey,"Re Dinner for 3 on 22 August 2019.

No sooner had we settled,very comfortably, into a table on the Osprey's delightful patio and been served our first courses than a sudden squall roared across the East River, blowing away tablecloths and smashing glasses and dishes.  Without missing a beat, or trying to save the crockery on nearby empty tables, the staff swooped in, whisked away our dishes and escorted us to a comfortable indoors booth, where, as lightning, thunder and rain howled outside, we proceeded to have an excellent meal.  

The Osprey, no longer so new, (though it still has the shiny, sleek look of a a newish Amsterdam or Copenhagen brasserie) is a welcome addition to the Brooklyn dining scene.  The menu has many attractive dishes (an extraordinary crab-meat ""gaspacho"" in a milky, nut-based soup, for example).  Ingredients, preparations and presentations, without being overly fussy, are outstanding.  

The staff is trained to a high levell of professionalism and is involved, solicitous but discreet -- this level of service is unusual, to say the least, in Brooklyn (save perhaps at the neighboring River Café).

A great deal of thought and talent has gone, not only into the food and the extraordinary, almost bucolic, riverside location, but also into design -- into the pleasingly modern décor, certainly,  but also into all the service items -- the cutlery, the china and so forth.  Everything is remarkably tasteful and well-chosen.

A bottle of wine that we had selected turned out to be unavailable (the selection skews upmarket, but is also well-chosen, with just enough promising-sounding  bottles in the $54-$70 range to make us non-tycoons feel welcome), as was the Armagnac that we ordered after the meal.  To apologize, the manager offered us, for free, an outstanding fine-champagne Cognac.  This is a sign of a high-class establishment, which the Osprey definitely is.  

One small concern -- all those sleek glass and uncovered wooden surfaces in the main dining room do make for a high noise level (I still wish we could have finished our meal on the much quieter patio, but nature willed otherwise), but that's hardly unusual these days, and at least there was no detectable soundtrack blaring in the background to make things worse, a rare blessing.  

You do not expect bargain prices in such an establishment, and, as others have commented, The Osprey's definitely are not.  But, in relation to the state of the art in NYC these days, the price-quality ratio here is very high.  (In fact, it brings to mind some of the more successful Danny Meyers creations, which is high praise indeed.)  You can pay a lot more elsewhere for a lot less.  I will definitely be back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Walked into the Osprey, very friendly hosts who let us change tables multiple times (we wanted to sit outside but it ended up being too humid for us). Our servers made the transition smooth, (all the servers were stellar; Adam, Ronal, Lindsey, Mikayla) they kept refilling our wine and water at appropriate times. They were also very friendly and engaged us in fun and witty conversation. Sterling and Solace helped us with our wine selection. Perfectly paired to our meal. The wines were sustainable and biodynamic (we are old hippies, we like this kind of thing). Furthermore, Sterling made our transition to the roof very smooth. Great experience with BOMB ASS VIEWS. Highly recommend. Much love to this restaurant and how they took care of my girlfriend on her birthday!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"This is by far one of the best places to brunch, especially for brunch. I really enjoyed coming here for brunch on a sunny day and going to the rooftop after to look at the wonderful.

I would also like to thank our waiter Adam for the wonderful service he gave and his kindness.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Really enjoyed the Sunday brunch. Went on special occasion (a birthday) and the (great number of) servers were friendly and quite attentive to our small group. Everything we tasted, from Smoked Salmon Benedict and Frittata, to pancakes and fruit, was excellent. They even threw in some extra goodies for us. Got a tour of the soon-to-be-opened rooftop from Elvis Escobar, who was knowledgeable and helpful.

My dining partners loved the Brussel Sprouts and Wilted Spinach. S'mores dessert was great - lovers of S'mores have to try it! Skewers were not bad as well. Lovely food, servers and ambience. Wish I got the chance to dine at the roof - will definitely try the next time.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Came here on a Saturday night around 9:30pm. We didn't have reservations but thankfully tables were open and we were seated right away. The restaurant itself looked really nice, the decor was really cool and the views were amazing. Now onto the food, we started off with a cheese platter, it looked good...just wish I knew what kind of cheese was on it at first. From past experiences, when ordering a cheese plate usually the waiter will say what cheeses we are being served but, here that was not the case. Had to play a guessing game for a bit until we are asked.

For entrees I ordered the Lemon Herb Chicken which I found to be nothing exciting and kind of bland. I would like to have seen this served with some sort of green vegetable or served with something else with the spaghetti squash.

Overall the atmosphere was great, drinks were good, just the food needs a little more improvement.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Cannot recommend the Osprey enough - went for brunch, great location right across the Brooklyn Bridge with a view of the water and the food was phenomenal.

The Osprey,"I don't leave reviews unless I'm particularly astounded by something, and this place managed to earn one. Went here to get a simple pre-dinner drink at the bar & sit on the patio on a very empty & slow Tuesday evening. The bartender took nearly 10 minutes to even make eye contact & offer a menu, followed by several minutes of waiting to order as he proceeded to take orders from a couple men who walked right up to the bar & he gave immediate service to before us.

We walked out, as it was apparent it was a purposeful ignorance of us. Please work on your unnecessary level of pretentious attitude & frankly douchie vibes. No place is cool enough to act that disrespectful.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Well.  I love the 1 Hotel, service was great everywhere except their restaurant.  It was a stark and unfortunate contrast.  Breakfast on a Sunday, the menu was limited but sufficient.  Received my food well before my drinks, then the waiter never came back to check on me or bring me the needed sweetener for my cappuccino, so it sat and went cold.   20+ minutes without service interaction is unacceptable.

Another diner a few tables over finally stood up and left, declaring his dissatisfaction the entire way out.

Nice looking place, and a nice view, but that was it.  I think this place has great potential but needs new management to get it back in order.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night and found the location and ambiance to be very good.  However, my dinner was supposed to have Chorizo and pasta and it was mostly just a bowl of past for nearly $30.  As an out of towner we know things are more expensive in NYC, but would've expected more for 3 of us when paying over $160.

Service was good and the quality of my companions' dinners seemed fine, mine was a disappointment though.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Between the amazing decor, service and food, this place is easily one of the top 2 restaurants in Dumbo!
I literally love everything about this place. The duck croquettes are a slam dunk! I'm not a fan of croquettes but I really enjoyed the texture and taste of these. So we were a party of 5, so every one got a different entree. The BEST ENTREE hands down is the scallops with grits. Now...I HATE GRITS...but this dish has turned me into a believer. I probably will not eat anybody grits but this restaurant. This seriously will be my go to restaurant especially for the summer time.
All the waitstaff were super friendly and efficient. I didn't feel too rushed and I also didn't feel like I was waiting around even when it got really busy. I had the sangria which was delicious and quite strong which..YES.thank you for that
Oh...dessert. The strawberry shortcake was sooo memorable. Again, NOT a fan of shortcake but I would definitely get this EVERY time. Imagine cake with nice cold whip cream filled with fresh sweet ripe strawberries.
Long story short, this place is a GEM.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"I have tried so many times to enjoy something from the menu here, but I have been disappointed every time. I want to tell you that you can at least enjoy a salad or appetizer here, but no! I have nit found anything worth trying again. I love this hotel so I keep trying to find at least something I could enjoy for a meal or a snack. Unfortunately they fail me every time. The drinks and service are pretty good though. That's why they get a second star.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The service was so poor. We were practically ignored the whole night. We were offered bread and didn't get it until after our appetizer. We also got our drinks after the appetizer. Tables that were seated after us got their entrés before us!
Furthermore, the selection is minimal for overpriced food. And if you're unlucky like us, it'll also come out cold.
The interior decoration is probably the only salvageable thing of our night.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The Osprey,"Overpriced, slow and underwhelming. I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and both times were disappointing.

Both times I've come it's taken a long time to be seated even though we've had reservations. They clearly just wanted us to spend some money at the bar and sent us there for 15 minutes before seating us.

Every entree is over $25, which would be fine except nothing that they serve is that special. A lot of them items we got were bland and/or lukewarm.

It's a nice looking place so I get the draw, but there are better places in the neighborhood.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Good restaurant but very awkward mixed-sex bathroom.

Men and women share the same toilet stalls and sink area. Thus, there is urine on the toilet seats from males. A sense of privacy and discretion is missing. It probably saved a few dollars. But it's just a failed idea masked as a progressive statement.

My duck was ok.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"This place is awesome, went there today for the first time with my husband and will definitely be back again. Malcom, the bartender was amazingly professional and had a super nice personality. I had a delicious beet salad and my husband had the avocado toast with smoked salmon. Very nice atmosphere, inside and out, we decided to eat at the bar because it was a full house. They had so many great things to choose from and watching the food get brought out by the servers and pass us by made deciding what to get quite difficult. Everyone that works there seems very nice and happy with their jobs, it was refreshing for sure.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The Osprey,"Was looking for a special experience for a family gathering and One Hotel Brooklyn Bridge delivered. With our dinner reservation, we were able to enjoy the rooftop bar and the beautiful warm summer evening view of Manhattan, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the East River. Off in the distance, across New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty was a silhouette against a setting sun. There were 7 of us, and I am typically concerned about large groups with  a chic restaurant like the Osprey, but it delivered. Our waiter Brendan was top notch. We asked to bring appetizers and we just put ourselves in his care and the food (and Brendan) did a great job. For our group, the main courses of Branzino, Artic Char, and the Pork Chop were all top notch. I am a bit hesitant to order Pork Chop, but this cut was a beast, was very succulent and moist and really tasty. Their fries are a must, if you get the chop. I liked the cold Sancerre, also selected by our waiter Brendan. The setting for the restaurant is simple, elegant and its not too noisy. In fact, it was very nice for conversation, which surprised me considering the size. All in all, a wonderful setting and memorable evening.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"I came for the view, stayed for the brunch.

I especially like to bring family members visiting the city here because it's overall such a great experience. The restaurant itself is stunningly beautiful. The plants and the high ceilings for an inviting, modern and luxurious space with a postcard perfect view of the Brooklyn Bridge.

The food and service is excellent. The coffee is great. The eggs have always been cooked perfectly. Priced about what you would expect for what you get. There tends to be an interested array of eaters being that it's attached to the 1 hotel and that adds to the unique atmosphere of the restaurant. Unlike some restaurants, where the combination of crowds, rushed service, etc can make one a bit stressed, I've always left The Osprey happier and more relaxed when I came in.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,Elvis was amazing! He set me up with a table with an amazing view and provided the best customer service.

The Osprey,"I really wanted to love this place- mostly because the location is gorgeous and the service was really top notch. For real, they excel at service for sure. However, the food was just not worth the price ( it's pretty pricey for what you get).

the pork chop was extra fatty and the risotto tasted far too acidic ( really really lemony and sweet). It seems likes  the kitchen lacked a bit of finesse. Trim a bit of fat and hit that risotto with some fresh black pepper!!

I wouldn't eat here again, but I'd def. come here for a drink... and as said, our server and the rest of the staff, including the busser were really personable and polite.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The Osprey,"AMBIENCE: Beautiful place but bothers me that they serve plastic straws in a hotel that claims to be eco friendly. On the same note, was also annoyed that they couldn't do a half portion for the cauliflower. (Eco friendly places should always try to prevent food waste).

FOOD: got fish and chips, burger, and cauliflower, the only thing that was amazing was the cauliflower but even that had a bit of a strange taste from the grapes (they were oddly acidic).",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Had a pleasant brunch to along with the great view inside 1 Hotel. We ordered the chicken and waffles, whitefish pate and fontina thyme biscuits. The chicken waffles had a Asian fusion spin and pleasantly surprised how moist the chicken was. The white fish pate is just a personal favorite of mine and it was creamy and delicious. Needs more toast on the side. The biscuits were delicious and the Jane on the side was unnecessary. The Jam was Too sweet and runny. Overall, enjoyed the brunch selection and just love being inside the 1 hotel's incredible designed hotel.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Came by this evening for an early dinner. We sat outside and whilst the food and cocktails were good, the evening was unfortunately ruined by the children using the outside eating area as a playground - running up and down the rocks and in between the tables where we were eating. Unfortunately, they came out (from their table inside) after we'd ordered, otherwise I would have got up and left like another couple did. Whilst I appreciate they were part of a group eating at the restaurant, we're all paying customers and this should be taken into consideration. At no point did any of the service staff attempt to control the situation.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Our server Mikayla was lovely and bright, guided us through the menu and answered all our questions. Leury the food runner was warm and gracious, the food was delicious especially the hen of the woods and the duck. Dessert was amazing we had the shaved ice and the coconut passion fruit. The busser Ahmed was very kind and made sure we enjoyed our food as he cleared our table. The bartender, Megan made our cocktails, they were fantastic!

I assume they just open... the waiter don't know what they are doing. It wasn't a busy time, but we waited for a long time to order food and later we waited for another 20 minutes for the check while the waiters were chatting without doing anything... they need more training for the staffs. But cute restaurant tho.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Most likely stemming from the bartender..... great space, great decor, now if they hire the right people it could be a great spot.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Hard to describe how good the food is. We read about their slow roaster on Eater, so we tried their 2 dishes that come out of it - the rotisserie chicken and prime rib. My god - we were completely blown away. We both agreed that these were the two top dishes we had all year. The texture of the prime rib is perfect, unbelievably tasty. The chicken is in a wonderfully complemented vegetable stew. Even the squash we had on the side was exceptional - makes us want to try the entire menu. Great atmosphere - all glass windows with views across the east river to lower Manhattan. Service is excellent. We will definitely be back - and often!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,The Hotel 1 is such a gorgeous space first thing to say. The restaurant was very welcoming and the food was great. I had the cauliflower vegan dish and the Branzino Fish dish I asked them to take off the shrimp because I didn't want it and they did It was delicious. I felt healthy and good after eating here I didn't feel like a fat beast. I ate at the bar with my friend and the bartenders were friendly and good conversation the staff is with it and normal that work here. The warm olives were good and they have tons of different types of Tequila here. I love good food and great drinks and this place delivered. The hotel is Dog friendly and super cute! They serve hot apple cider and fresh apples in the lobby you can't beat that !,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Everything about my experience at The Osprey last Friday was absolutely perfect. We had a reservation and they had a table available but we didn't care for the location so we agreed to wait for another table. While we waited, we had a cocktail from the bar and the mixologist nailed my drink. I asked her to surprise me, she asked what I like and created something that I may have to return for (I have no idea what was in it.) We then headed to our table and the young lady (her name started with a M) was so attentive and paid attention to details. As soon as I said I was vegan, she walked me through the entire menu and gave suggestions on how to veganize some menu items. She was fantastic. The ambiance, the food, the staff, the overall experience was exceptional and I am SO HAPPY that I chose to go there for dinner. The volume was also perfect cause me and my friend were able to talk and not have to scream over each other. I'll be going back for sure.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,Love the farm fresh ingredients and the creativity displayed by the chef in the New American cuisine here. I have had a variety of the dishes on the menu and they are all delicious. The cocktails here are excellent and the service is top notch (especially Adam!) - a great find here in DUMBO!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,The Osprey in 1 Hotel Brooklyn in Dumbo is great. The ambiance of the Hotel is mind blowing! Sustainable and eco friendly designs. Organic touch throughout the restaurant and hotel.Our host was very welcoming and the food superb! I highly recommend the Tuna Tartare.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"What a lovely restaurant!

I took visitors from Paris here, trying hard to find a place that had an impressive view AND fantastic food to keep up with those high French standards. The day we had a dinner reservation was one of the first nice Saturdays the city's had this year, so it was insane. We arrived to our reservation super late (like, 45 minutes because MTA), and, while the staff had EVERY reason to nope out on seating us, they were so incredibly accommodating and collected - despite the surge in customers - it really made the entire experience so worth it. The food was delicious, the dining room, view of downtown Manhattan, and ambience fabulous, and whoever hired the staff and the staff themselves really deserve the five stars here. I'm really looking forward to this being my go-to when hosting tourists and for my own beautiful evening out.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Amazing view, great food and good service.
French in holiday we were really well served by Sara whose French is much better than our English. Amis Francais, vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés ! Enfin pas trop quand même la vue est à couper le souffle.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Had a fantastic NYE dinner at the Osprey with some friends. Our server, Paul, was stellar and the food was fantastic.

Chef of the Osprey is a Locanda Verde veteran and it shows. My favorite parts of the meal were the steak tartare and the duck but every dish was amazing. Other highlights: chilled seafood salad, scallops, beef duo, oysters, Camembert toast.

Also check out the roof for an awesome view of the river/Manhattan.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The Osprey is decorated beautifully with a very garden feel. There is a small menu, that's a little on the pricier side given the taste. But the proximity to the Brooklyn Bridge Park views and great environment help make up for this. I had a pretty okay burger, and my friend thought the fish n chips were subpar. However, we both loved the fries. The employees were all very friendly and helpful, as well!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"My wife and I had reservation on a Thursday night.  There was a fantastic energy upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted warmly by the host, Al Lisha.  Luckily we were able to sit next to the gorgeous floor to ceiling windows. Outside was popping since it was such a nice night.  Our server Mikayla introduced herself and explained that it is a share plates place, which works for us just fine!  We loved the hen of the woods mushrooms with a balsamic glaze, as well as the duck breast with its ""duck confit cigar""!  After our meal we got drinks at the bar, Meghan the bartender is really friendly, and made a delicious Smoke and Daggers.  Legitimately a perfect date night, everyone was so hospitable and the food and drinks were 10/10.  We will definitely be back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Nice ambience, nice staff. Very long food wait time, food was very mediocre, and staff are stretched too far. My fish was $36, not seasoned well, and the potatoes that came with it were all burnt. The ""shrimp"" that comes with it was actually 1 shrimp. The stack of vegetables on the side which I believe are basil are not edible but for garnish.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,Incredible service and food. I am vegan and gf. They don't have many options on the menu but we're willing to accommodate and make things off the menu like a lettuce wrapped veg burger and a side of beets. Highly recommend it.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,Lovely restaurant with a nice view of the Brooklyn bridge and waterfront. The restaurant inside the 1 Hotel and it's an interesting hotel to visit. The staff are friendly and food was very good. Had a brunch on a Sunday morning and no wait for seating. However it took about 20 minutes to get our food. Other than that all is fine. I will come back.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"We got a reservation about an hour before we went... so that was good.  However, it took FOREVER for the food and the food was just decent at best. I was expecting a lot more. Then the waitress took forever with our check, and forever to pick up our credit card after we left it for her. It was our anniversary and I was hoping for better.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,The ambience is amazing and most people get attracted to this place because of the view. The rooftop is lively and a great place to chill. But honestly we weren't happy with the restaurant food. It was a saturday night and we sat outside as the weather was great. But we had to wait for 2 hours to get our main course. How crazy is that?!! The waiter was really polite and was apologizing to us and the couple on the next table for the delay but we have no idea why the food took so much time. And it wasn't even worth the wait. The meat wasn't cooked well and we ended up having a bite and leaving. So if you want to enjoy some great view with music then you should go to the rooftop. The food here is not upto the mark.,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,This amazing restaurant is under the culinary wing of Chef Ivy.  Perfect for a date if you're looking to impress a new suitor.  The atmosphere is stunning and the staff is beyond warm and welcoming.  The lighting alone is a work of art and the food is divine.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Delicious food & drinks here.  We meet friends here on our first night in NYC and this place did not disappoint.  We sat outside, which was lovely and although it was a warm night, it was very pleased to.  I had lobster arinchinni which was the special and OMG it was delicious.  I paired it with some brocollini which was cooked well & was plentiful.  We all loved our meal & drinks. Our friends live not to far so I'm sure they'll be back & I'll be back next time I'm in town too!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Love this new edition to our Brooklyn Waterfront. Nestled in the chic and cozy 1 Hotel, this casual candlelit restaurant has a priceless view of the skyline and an impressive menu of beautifully plated comfort foods. Husband and I were so torn but ultimately enjoyed the beet salad appetizer, then duck breast and grilled branzino filet for entrees. All of the dishes were so well prepared with bright, fresh flavors and hearty portions. We definitely plan to return to try the scallops, pork chop, prime rib, and Coney Island chowder.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,I had the absolute best time at The Osprey! The manager Sterling was amazing! He brought us up to the rooftop and truly showed us what New York is about.. the views and the drinks. The whole property is dog friendly and my dog loved seeing the views with us. This will be our summer spot. All of the staff was so friendly. Thanks for a great time!!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Brunch here was so excellent! We got seated right away and ate a delicious salmon scramble and fried chicken and waffles. Both were unique, tasty and well balanced in terms of flavor. We decided to level up and get some drinks - the All Hands On Deck was so good. Tasted like a fresh summer morning. We ended with the most insane apple crisp with cinnamon ice cream. Will definitely be coming back to enjoy that outdoor patio!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"This place, simply put: amazing ! Food is delicious, service is great. I went two times, brunch & dinner. Will definitely be coming back !",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"I was nervous to make a reservation here due to the mixed reviews but was really eager to check out the beautiful space and views.

Out of the hit and miss experiences which it seems that people have had here, our experience was a hit. It was my parents' anniversary and I arranged with the hosts and servers to have a bottle of champagne ready and they added a handwritten card for my parents and some treats at the end of the meal - I really appreciated the little personal touch!

The food was tasty (although a little overpriced in comparison to other restaurants in the area), service was friendly and fast, and the space is stunning. Finally at the end of the night, your receipt from the restaurant allows you to go up the roof without paying cover to enjoy a drink with one of the most stunning rooftop bar views in NYC.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The place is a rip off... bought an orange juice (which was ok), a tartine and a chicken salad sandwich for 32usd. The tartine was a slice of bread with cheese and a little bit of cold tomato sauce. The sandwich was so small and was so cold that i could not believe that was it... Apart from that, they took 30mins to deliver those 2 food items to the table. Do not go there.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,Really slow service - extremely slow. But the steak was amazing and the lemon shrimp appetizer was the best. Outdoor seating made the night. Avoid the chicken - not well seasoned.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Let's start off by saying the location and ambience of the osprey is beautiful. I'm sure it's gorgeous in the summer time. Now, moving on. We got there and the wait staff seemed very nice and attentive ( we were still waiting for more people to join us). They came by to ask if we wanted drinks for starters. We ordered our drinks which was coffee, a cappuccino and 2 alcoholic drinks. The coffee which was literally right next to us took forever to be served. I literally got my cappuccino before my husband and my brother in law who wanted regular black coffee. I then had to ask for sugar. I personally feel that sugar should be automatic when serving coffee. Finally the rest of the party arrives and we start ordering food. Everyone's food came out except for one order, the steak and eggs. We had placed 3 orders of steak and eggs and only two came out. The wait staffed looked confused.  Oh and I must add that we had like 3 different waiters, why? That just causes confusion. Hence, the reason why they all looked confused lol, But anyway, we ended up eating with out the other person having their meal as it was taking too long. So their excuse was ""we over cooked the steak"".  Ok fine but why was it taking so long to come out now. Anyway, it was so annoying that we had to keep asking for coffee or a drink more than once. Sir, where's my coffee?! Lastly, the manager came to apologize for the late/missed meal and gave a comp on the alcoholic beverage. I honestly hoped that he would have comped the meal... an establishment like that come on dude! But yeah, would I go again? probably not. Maybe for a drink because it was delish. Oh I forgot the food was mediocre. I've had better brunch at a diner.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The worst place. Waited for 15 minutes for a table when the restaurant was empty. Took 45 minutes to get the appetizer and they spilled coffee all over us. Didn't even wait to get my food. Worst service, never going again",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"An amazing dinner ! All of the entrees are balanced, temperatures and textures perfected and the flavors are savory ! We hope they offer a new season menu soon with sun peaking through here in Brooklyn. Thank you Osprey and special thanks to Tyler Clark for going above and beyond !",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Really just the prettiest restaurant. Very romantic. The food was very good. We got the whitefish pate, baby beets, mussels, duck croquettes and seared scallops. The duck croquettes is really a MUST! The mussels were delicious. I personally love beets plain so I thought they made the beets were too vinegar-y. I didn't personally love the whitefish or the scallops. Isn't deterring me from coming back real soon!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,Horrible service. Walked up to the nearly empty bar to get pre-dinner drinks. Took forever for the bartender to even acknowledge our presence. We waited a looong time while he slowly made cocktails for the only other 2 people at the bar. Then he started taking orders for other people that had showed up much later than us. Extremely rude and disrespectful. We left and decided to go somewhere that actually wanted our business. Don't bother here.,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Bread pudding French toast was good, but the bread was a bit too cakey for my taste. The lemon curd was quite tasty though; needed more of it to go with the bread, so I had some left over.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,Loved having dinner last night 6/29/18 at The Osprey. The ricotta with honey and chili oil was delicious. The mussels were fresh with the spicy chorizo. The bread and butter was great. The service was also great. Overall it was a pleasant dinner.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,Beautiful restaurant in a beautiful hotel with a menu thats not overwhelming. The mussels and the steak were cooked perfectly and seasoned well. The drinks were a bit on the pricey side in my opinion but they didn't skimp on the quantity or the quality. Wait staff paid just enough attention and answered all our questions happily. I would definitely try Osprey again when the weather is warmer because they have a wonderful outdoor seating area with a fantastic view.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"This place has very nice ambience and the staff are very helpful. Ashanti was very nice and was able to accommodate me and my friends many times when we had to change our seats.

The fried chicken and waffles are very good, and the pancakes are very hearty. I also tried the fish and chips, fish was very very tender. I would definitely come back here.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"It is true this place has a unique location and the views are amazing (the brooklyn bridge) but somehow I did not like it. Maybe if this place was in Manhattan I would not have cared.  But being in brooklyn it reminded of the gentrification that has made brooklyn lose some of its charm.

When I'm in brooklyn I enjoy the small cozy privately run restaurants with amazing food and a friendly personal touch. This place is not that. It's one of your generic corporate restaurants that serves ok food and has ridiculous prices for a glass wine ($24 for a glass of Cabernet?!).

The food while not bad, was not amazing, definitely not the price worth coming back for.

While it make be an ok place for tourists to enjoy the view, I think as a New Yorker I will definitely not be back.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

First could find my reservation, then waited to sit us for 20 minute, didn't give a menu, came to take the order in 20 minutes... ect.
the brunch was mediocre.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

We LOVED the lobster appitizer, which was recommended by our amazing server, Adam. As well as the ricotta appitizer.

The Osprey,"Underwhelming from hosts who gave us a table in the middle of high traffic area even though we made reservations days in advance to slow service, forgotten dishes and poor wine selection by glass (no rioja why?!). They seemed very understaffed. Food was not bad but tables are dark, it's hard to see what you are eating. There was an engagement party and they allowed a professional photographer take pictures with a flash for the entirety of our dinner in the glass dinning room, it was extremely annoying to everyone and yet the staff did not care. Will not return.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"We had a reservation at 9 pm, didn't get seated until 10 pm. Had a drink at the bar where the bartender said he forgot an ingredient in the drink and had to remake it, after he charged us for the drink, and our food was lukewarm and average. They gave us champagne for the wait, which I don't drink.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The Osprey,"After a long week of work, crappy weather and mediocre room service in New Jersey; I decided to venture out for dinner at The Osprey inside the 1 Hotel in Brooklyn, NY. From the moment I walked in I felt a really cool vibe about this restaurant. The lounge was lightly lit giving it a very sexy look. I sat at the bar where I was greeted by Isaiah, the bartender and his bar back. They both were so nice and engaging my entire time there. You could tell they were happy in their environment and enjoyed what they did. I ordered the bacon wrapped dates and white fish Pate. Both were delicious! The bacon wrapped dates were a perfect combination of sweet and Savory and the white fish pate with mustard seeds and everything seasoning cracker was delicious. I'm a sucker for everything seasoning so they had me hooked with just that! For the entree I had the pork chop with and apple compote on top. It has been 4 days since I've had this pork-chop and I am still raving about how perfectly charred it was on the top while still perfectly med inside. For dessert I had the chocolate fudge cake and substituted the espresso ice cream for vanilla. Either flavor would have tasted well. The fudge cake was so gooey inside that the ice cream slowly melted on top giving me the perfect bite of warm fudge and cold ice cream. During my meal I also had Lela as a bartender. She was the sweetest person and very knowledgeable about her spirits. It was a treat watching her mix a cocktail like it was some sort of potion. Overall I had such a wonderful experience. I can't thank the team enough for making my night with the great conversations and food. I can't wait to go back and try more items.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Looks better than it tastes and the service is mediocre, especially for the price. We went for brunch. We had reservations and still had to wait at least 20 min. We sat at the bar and no one asked us if we wanted anything. The group next to us was trying to order food and ended up leaving because no one ever came over. The venue is gorgeous and everything is very instagramable though...",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The Osprey,"The Osprey is AMAZING! I went here this past weekend with some girlfriends and absolutely loved it. Everything was perfect - great views, great food, great drinks and great service. The branzino and artic char were to die for. They also had a fabulous wine list. Sterling and Adam were so attentive and took such great care of us. I am definitely going to be going back again with friends and family!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Nice ambience but that's about it?? The food was good but nothing amazing. A bit over price but since it's hotel restaurant maybe that's acceptable. It was the service that came short really. We arrived about 30 min early. The hostess politely refused to sit us, saying she'd do that when it's close to my reservation time. There were lots of empty seats so i was like ???? But sure. When we returned close to our reservation time, there was a gentleman before us wishing to be seated earlier than the reservation time. She again politely refused. The man pointed out empty seats but she said they are reserved and the time is coming soon. Ok. Understandable. We were seated but the service was very slow. And if I'm not mistaken the mug in front of me had lipstick/lipmark on it. The waiter kept making small mistakes.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"We have had the worse experience in this place despite the lovely location and the setting. Service was terrible right from the start with waiter ( Jasmine) barely making it to the table. Next was on the wine menu where 4 if the rose wines were unavailable so we had to settle with a mediocre replacement. Last we had the worse risotto in the history of risottos. No flavor, no seasoning, cold and overall a bad choice. We had to send it back and thankfully we were not charged for it but nobody even bothered to apologize. Finally we were given the check and 20 min later nobody came by to process the payment. Overall left disappointed and will not go back. Management needs to seriously overhaul that operation.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,We got to the restaurant 15 minutes late after calling and telling them we were delayed due to traffic from the city. They said on the phone it was no problem but when we got there we were rudely told that the kitchen closed at 3pm! Why did they book a 2:45 reservation for a kitchen closing at 3pm.  Typical snobby attitude.,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Really enjoyed brunch at The Osprey. You'll find nice decor, professional staff and an egg sandwich with gruyere and perfectly cooked bacon on a brioche roll that will make your day.

A word of warning- the prices are a bit high. A very small glass of pineapple juice is $4 and the mixed drinks on the brunch menu are $15 each.

Worth a visit and a walk around the neighborhood for sure.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

- Mushroom appetizer
- Risotto entree",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"We were seated at 1:40 pm and were waiting over ONE hour and TWENTY minutes for our food... this is a table for two with a baby. I am vegetarian and requested NO MEAT(I watched the waiter write it down) and when my simple egg sandwich arrived it had bacon in it, so back it goes to the kitchen and I have to wait another 20min ... while my wife ate by herself. When I finally got my sandwich I was frustrated and had lost my appetite AND I could taste bacon(not sure if they removed it or make the eggs in the same pan)... I just gave up and got the check.
They did comp the sandwich and apologized for the wait but not good enough. I understand that you are busy but you can not make people wait that long. Terrible experience and ruined my afternoon.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Great location, beautiful setting, with very good food (better than expected, but not necessarily memorable). We had ricotta and the duck for starters and both were very tasty. The scallops were very fresh, and nicely cooked. The strawberry shortcake was meh - basically just whipped cream and strawberries and almost no cake. HOWEVER, they have to fix the bathroom situation. You have to use the bathroom open to the public and it's disgusting. To be at a fancy meal and then use a bathroom that smells gross, where the toilet seats are way to gross to sit on and where my husband literally almost had his shoe sucked off from the muck on the ground- that is enough to keep me from bringing more visitors to this restaurant (every person in our party came back disgusted). We mentioned it to the host, and they said it was the hotel's responsibility.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"So disappointing.  Atmosphere is beautiful. Service was all over the place but all would be forgiven if the food wasn't terrible.  Came here for a special occasion - and while I normally have a sense of humor the prices are nothing the laugh about.  As we sat there waiting for our lukewarm food we could hear the chef yelling out commands to kitchen staff even though we were seated in the front of the restaurant.  Food was nearly inedible - bread was stale, mussels were watery, cauliflower came out cold, and risotto was terrible.  We wanted to love this place so much.  To top everything off the cookies served at the end were also stale.  Superficial stuff on point - don't eat the food.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"The restaurant was lovely. Location and design impressive. We struggled to find a nice restaurant in Manhattan that was open for lunch so this was perfect, albeit flawed. It felt empty, maybe because it was new, or just a dreary day? We had a 1:15pm rsvp and thought it would be bustling. Upon arrival, it was raining, so we tried to valet but no one was there to take the car. Ended up parking in the garage at the hotel. Like 30 bucks for lunch parking, but hey it's manhattan. No easy way to get from the garage to the hotel. Had to walk up the ramp and through the rain to get to the hotel. Very poor planning and design for a new hotel and restaurant of this caliber. Got to the restaurant, looked empty. Waited for the host a few minutes, nice guy. Waiter came right over and asked our water preference and took our drink order. Then asked if we were ready to order, no mention of specials or recommendations, no 'you just have to try the burger'. This seems to be the norm in Manhattan lately. Sad that I get a warmer welcome and more personal service at the Chick-fil-A in Greensboro. No introduction, no name, no what brings you here. Then it seemed like we got another waiter, then never saw him again and got another waiter. Everyone was nice enough but didn't feel that welcoming connection like you get at a place like the Wythe Hotel. But having owned my own restaurant I don't blame the staff. This is clearly a management issue, poor training and poor oversight. Don't even recall seeing anyone that looked like a manager on the floor. Food was solid, everything was good but nothing to write home about. No desserts at lunch? Really, can't even have a few slices of cake or ice cream? Seems like a big miss. Once food was served no one ever checked on us. Plates sat empty on the table for quite a while before they came and got them. Maybe there were 5 or 6 tables sat in the whole restaurant with a few folks at the bar. Staff seemed huddled by the bar or kitchen. I guess at the end of the day I was most impressed with the decor and location. I would certianly avoid rainy days. Food is good but nothing stood out. Fries were good but maybe a little parmesan. Like the French say its missing that certain 'je ne sais quoi'. Staff is nice but they make the place feel generic and lacking personality. Bigger smiles and a little engagement would have made a big difference. I'd give it another try when guests are in town, everyone has an off day but there is a lot of room for improvement.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Dinner was impeccable.  For a new restaurant the service and staff were remarkably in top form. The food was as beautiful as the view, fresh and delicious. We had the steak tartare, 2 salads and the jumbo shrimp.The mushroom and butternut squash bruschetta was amazing. Entrees of steak, scallops and veggies sides (try the Brussels sprouts ) were really perfect.  Great subtle atmosphere with stunning views.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"My husband and I were guest at 1 Hotel for a couple of nights. On the morning of check out, we had a 9am reservation for brunch. Before the hostess sat us, she told us we only had an hour because they have to accommodate another reservation at 10am. Was every guest told that before they were seated? We had reservation just like everyone else. Very unprofessional on their part and trust me--I will be more than happy to stay at the hotel again but never go to back to The Osprey. Similar thing happened the previous night. Hostess told us we can not be seated in the main dining room, but go outside and ask the outside hostess if they can accommodate us for dinner. I don't know what type of training your staff has--apparently it is lacking based on other reviews. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Have you ever been fortunate enough to experience one of those rarities in which your day intrinsically aligns and syncs with the utopian algorithm of Brooklyn? A friend and I stumbled upon a delightful outside garden terraced restaurant, The Osprey, which was the very first of the many splendors to come that day. We were greeted by an infectiously gravitational smile bestowed upon us by none other than a seamlessly brilliant and exquisitely dressed host Travis Gochnour that I later found out happened to be the general manager filling in for a hostess that had unexpectedly needed to leave that day. I was so impressed with Travis's versatility as he wore many costumes that day. From the careful way he guided my friend and I to our table to how he gently commanded all aspects of the restaurant's operation. Our server as well as the rest of the staff were diligent in inspiring us with absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS decisions on the menu that day. Our water glasses kept full throughout our entire meal, the staff was so kind and attentive, no doubt from the way the manager seemed to have lead by example and crafted a flawless crew.
The appetizers were far beyond anything I had ever had the privilege of tasting only to be followed by a simply satiating main course. I had the pork chop. It reminded me of how I'd eat over in Europe. The cuisine so clean and natural that if felt as though you could continually graze the day away and try absolutely everything on the menu, never feeling overly full or uncomfortable.
The atmosphere was so lush and vibrant. From the decor of the venue to the detailed positioning of its terrace sure to transport you to a magical backland ocean marsh where land meets the sea. Watching the countless tourists, joggers, families, outdoor enthusiasts, my eyes would blink creating a film of human wildlife that distanced me from my city life in a quite welcoming way.
The desserts were to die for. A blueberry sorbet and stracciatella gelato that was the perfect finale and send off for our afternoon.
I will certainly be back and outrageously recommend to anyone that they take a load off their shoulders and stop in at Osprey.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
The Osprey,"Horrible service. Walked in - hostess looked bored and they were all just chatting amongst one another. My husband and i waiting and no greeting. It was EMPTY and 530 pm. I've waited tables before, worked in hospitality and it was frustrating that nobody cared one ounce. We left ... too bad they think the sights overcome service. A joke and i wanted to like this place. I hope that does t happen to anyone else or if management reads this you will lose business quickly if you run things this way.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-osprey-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Ordered delivery from here via Caviar.

I got the chicken satay, chicken pho soup and lava cake.

Everything was delicious! You can even substitute noodles in the pho for zucchini noodles- I love that! The chicken satay was flavorful and I didn't even use the sauce it came with.

The lava cake was amazing- so rich and not too sweet, just the way I like it. It comes with red bean ice cream, which was good but definitely not my favorite.

I will definitely like to dine in here in the future!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Ordered delivery, food was awesome except for the French Lemon Tart. That was the only letdown; it tasted a bit artificial. Chicken & ginger rice bowl and Beef & lemongrass rice bowl were both excellent, though. They also threw in some bonus chocolate pudding which was good. Definitely will order again soon!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Exceptional experience all around. I had delivery from BoCaphe last night and it lived up to my experience dining at the restaurant. The delivery was speedy. Food was hot, great portion size and beautiful presentation (as you can see from my attached photo). I had the beef with zucchini. The beef was full of flavor with beautiful herbs on top.  The avocado chocolate mousse was delicious. Rich and guilt free vegan eating! So IMPRESSED!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"A delicious experience! Came here for brunch with a group of friends during a weekend New York trip. We were originally going to eat at Jack's Wife Frieda a few storefronts down, which we found out only took cash, so we walked down and stumbled upon BoCaphe and we sure are glad we did!

I ordered the vegan chocolate pancakes, a friend ordered one of the vermicelli bowls with a Vietnamese iced coffee, and another friend ordered the bao benedict. All of us thoroughly enjoyed! Though vegan, the pancakes were fluffy and filling, and the presentation was everything.

I don't recall a wait for this place, even at peak weekend morning hours. The interior was super cute!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"What in the world is going on with this restaurant.

Ordered the shrimp tempura with an empty sauce dish. When I asked if the appetizer is supposed to come with a sauce, the waiter said ""this does not. I don't know why they placed that there."" I'm pretty sure some sauce is supposed to accompany these dry pieces of food.

The pho is so small it must've been meant for a child.

Overall, overpriced & inauthentic. The gallery is filled with pictures by the business which is a huge red flag because it shows this place isn't memorable enough to take pictures. I wouldn't be surprised if the business paid for all the great reviews in exchange for free food.

Nothing to say about the service because it seemed she was more into her looks.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,This cute place in soho is my go-to for bao buns! The beef bao bun is 10/10 saucey and delicious. The tarp fries were also very good. My favorite part is happy hour. BO offers $11-13 drinks for happy hour and they are amazingly curated! Outdoor seating is plentiful and service is friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back for happy hour!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Interesting little vietnamese-french fusion cuisine going on here. I met up with a colleague here, to catch up over dinner. The atmosphere was definitely super hip, something that could equally swing date night or chill night with friends. I got the classic pho noodle soup (3/5), and my colleague the beef and lemongrass rice bowl (4/5). My pho bowl was good, however def miss the portion sizes and freshness of the bowls from a traditional vietnamese place that you could find elsewhere in NYC. I also got a bubble tea drink (2/5) to go with my food... Pass on this one, the bubbles were overcooked and the tea not really flavorful unfortunately. Overall, cute shop, meh food. Probably won't be back.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"French vietnamese fusion for bruch?! Sign me up. Happened upon BoCaphe while searching for brunch on Saturday morning in SoHo. There was a short 15 minute wait, which we didn't mind since it was a sunny morning and pleasant to wait outside.

The vibes and ambiance of BoCaphe are absolutely adorable. Neon lights, festive wallpaper, flowers on each table, hanging plants. The interior is small and tight, but they've laid it out nicely. The menu has a little something for everyone. We took the bao benedict with turkey bacon, and it was delicious! The bao puts a unique twist on a breakfast classic. We also shared the crispy spring roll for an appetizer which was delicious! It was indeed crispy, and filled with chicken, ginger, and veggies! The dipping sauce was great as well. The drinks were out of this world. I took the mezcal based one, and it was smokey, yet still light and drinkable. I loved it! I can't remember the names (or bases) of the other drinks my friends got, but I sipped each, and all were uniquely delicious, and strong!

Overall BoCaphe made for the perfect start to our morning in NYC. Portions were a bit on the smaller side, which we appreciated as we planned on eating our way through the city. The staff was also incredibly kind and accommodating. They spoke French too! Would definitely come back here next time I'm in NYC.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Delicious! I always panic order cocktails and I got the one with green in its name with tequila. It came in a clay pot and it was so good! I was extremely hung over and I drank this drink that tasted like cucumber water and felt so much better! #HairOfTheDog  I think I ordered the best drink out of my whole table.

I ordered the egg Boa Benedict and got the turkey bacon on the side. Those potatoes are to die for! Couldn't tell if it was the Sriracha or the potatoes but they were the perfect amount of spicy. I'm a loser so I ate with a fork but they give you chopsticks.

I'm from Chicago so this restaurant seemed so jampacked and small. It was really cute though love the cushions. Our servers we're French and like 7 feet tall So hot. Highly recommend this place! If you like Vietnamese French food which I didn't know it was a thing. MAKE A RESERVATION!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Well, I gasped when they handed me the bill!

Not because of the price but because they serve you the bill tucked into a book and it happened to be my all-time favorite, ""The Little Prince"" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry!  Bo Ca Phe is a Vietnamese restaurant with a French twist, hence, the reference to ""The Little Prince.""

Honestly, I loved the atmosphere and decor inside. It's cute and cozy and the bathroom is SPACIOUS. Something you don't find as often in NYC. (I couldn't figure out how to work the Dyson faucet/dryer though. Was that supposed to be a two in one? That's the fanciest faucet I've seen in Vietnamese establishment! Where was the air blasting out of? Couldn't figure out how to dry my hands ‍)

We stopped in for a quick bite to eat for dinner. I opted for the Shrimp Vermicelli bowl aka Bo Bun or Rice Noodle Salad for those of you who are not familiar with Vietnamese cuisine. He opted for their Vegan Pho.
My dish was EXACTLY what I had expected it to be. No frills. No fancy ingredients. Just the way I expected it to be prepared.

Yes, the price is more expensive ($17 for Bo Bun w/ Shrimp) but what do you expect in New York City? You can't expect to get the same dish for the same price you pay in San Jose, CA or Houston, TX people!

for vegan-friendly options!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday was told to wait 10 minutes for a seat we waited and when the seat were available it was given to someone who came after us. As we see everyone else getting seated before us and supposed miscommunication between the staff unfolding. I was ready to leave it's 1:30 pm am starving....finally they get us a table and am really hoping that the food was worth the wait and I was disappointed...Like really disappointed. I ordered the vegan pho which was drenched in cinnamon powder. Never have I ever seen so much cinnamon in pho. My friends had chicken pho and another friend had classic pho and they were just okay. We always get pho from PHoBar near west 4 and it's double the size, cheaper and fricking delicious.

Anyways not going to bother coming back to this place. The only good thing was taro fries but it's hard to mess those up. We had lemonades for drink. Paid almost $35 each for just 'meh' brunch and still disappointed.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

I had a Vietnamese iced coffee and the breakfast bahn mi, both were so good! The bahn mi came on a really yummy toasted baguette and all the flavors were on point. It also came with a huge portion of fries (not sure what kind of starch they used but it was great) and a tangy dipping sauce. Me and my sister both don't eat a TON so we couldn't finish our food and the server asked if we liked it and then gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse which was so nice!!

Called the restaurant and they let me know they would resend another one and told me the driver already is no their way, which was a complete lie. Called again and whoever was on the phone hang up on me. With service and quality food as such, interesting to see how much longer they are survive the post Covid world!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Ordered delivery from here a few nights ago - for the price we paid and the food we got, I'm not sure if it is worth it to order again.  We paid $8 for the summer roll, and only got one cut in half.  We should have gotten at least two summer rolls for $8!  Same thing with the spring roll, which was more like a one ball cut in half for $7.  The Chicken Bao was not assembled at all - just a bun thrown into the container with chicken, carrots and cilantro thrown in.  The vermicelli bowl was decent (again only one small spring roll in it), the pho was good, but both dishes were luke-warm.  Pretty sure there are better Vietnamese places in the area for delivery :/",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Stopped in for a late brunch on a Sunday afternoon and there was virtually no wait. Overall restaurant spacing is on the crowded side, but also not unexpected by Manhattan standards.

Onto the food which came out pretty quickly -

- Vietnamese Iced Coffee is too watery, wouldn't order that again
- The Egg/Omelette Bahn Mi was surprisingly super tasty (bonus points for how good the cheese is!)
- Papaya Salad was also really good though I wish it were a little spicier
- Initially, I was a little disappointed with the Eggs Benedict since my eggs were not poached properly and overcooked, but the restaurant rectified this and everything was much better

Our server was MIA for most of our meal, which depending on how much you care for service can be good or bad - I think the bare minimum would be to ask how everything tastes, but maybe I'm too picky.

Cute aesthetic and cute ambiance, but overall not the amazing flavor bomb I would expect from Vietnamese and French fusion. Sadly, nothing to write home about.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"I passed by BoCaphe while walking around for a place to eat for brunch, and I'm so glad I went in! We were seated immediately. The service was rather quick and the waiters were super friendly. I also love the aesthetic of the restaurant!

My boyfriend ordered the green papaya chicken salad, which he enjoyed. His dish made him excited to come back and try other dishes they have! I got the chicken & ginger cauliflower rice bowl. I was wowed by the amazing cauliflower rice with the delicious sauce it came with. I'm normally not a huge fan of cauliflower rice, but OH MAN- this dish was SO good! The portions were perfect! The ratios of the rice to chicken to vegetable were just satisfying and everything tasted very fresh. I would come back here and order this again!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"This place is overhyped. The food was mediocre and overpriced. The servers looked miserable. I was with a party of 5 and we were seated in the back next to the kitchen. It was much brighter and less nicer compared to the front of the restaurant. We were so cramped and uncomfortable we barely had room for our bags or coats.

I had the Beef Bao Burger with added Shitake and Truffle sauce. If you plan on getting this, this don't bother with the extra mushroom truffle. The truffle sauce reminded me of an olive paste. You don't taste truffle at all. The meat patty was bland and greasy. The side of Taro Fries were dry, flavorless and didn't go well with spicy mayo or ketchup...

For drinks I tried the Lychee Martini which tasted okay it just had too much rosewater. I don't recommend coming here for Vietnamese food. It only looks great in pictures.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"I came to Bo Ca phe not for the food but the mural on the wall , but the chocolate pancakes I had will make me return again.

The menu list the pancakes as vegan, whatever, to me they tasted good, not to much coco and fresh fruit on them gave an interesting combo and taste switch with each bite while drinking the lemonade that came in the mason jar.

I was OK that it took a while to get my order because I was sneaky in taking my photos because the place was crowed and I didn't want any noses in my shots. You will find the place small maybe cozy depending where you sit and get used to the upside down plants on the ceiling.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Is it authentic Vietnamese food? No, but does it taste good? Yes!! This place has a twist on Vietnamese cuisine which makes it different and unique from others which is why it's nice for a bit of change.

I saw this on Yelp as I was looking for some viet food and came across this place. I tried their vermicelli hoodies with beef and their classic pho. I must say the noodles were BOMB! it was a perfect blend of noodles and veggies and the meat was well marinated which gave it so much flavor. A def favorite of mine! The classic pho however....the broth did not taste like the usual pho I would get at different pLaces. It tasted a bit more earthy and had different spices I wasn't familiar with. It was a cold day so I still ate it regardless but it was just different.

The place is very cute but a bit tight as I had a party of 10 which I'm so glad they accepted my reservation as they said they don't take any on Sundays. Overall, it was a good experience, but not sure if I'd come again if I want Vietnamese food.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"The ambiance of BoCaphe is adorable, casual and cozy. The staff was friendly and welcoming.

Overall, they served solid fusion American-Vietnamese food but the price is kind of high compared to the portion and the choices on menu were limited. We were there as a group of 9 people, tried most of options on the menu and our favorite was their salad.

The broth of pho was flavorful and light but my male colleagues complained they didn't feel satisfied at all after they finished. The balance of vermicelli and ingredients wasn't too good, my colleague needed to eat her rest of vermicelli with my chicken. The green papaya salad was the best among all our orders, the chicken was braised tender and tasty but little salty.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

BoCaphe,"Cute place but VERY disappointing- both of us ordered the shrimp entree, which was about 85% carrot (no exaggeration, see photo)... and the rest peanut butter.

Service was also non-existent, which was odd since there was only one other tablet present upon arrival.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Not sure of the hype around this place..did we not order the right thing?

I (&the others in my party) got a vermicelli bowl with beef. It tasted fine and the flavors were all there and everything but it was basically double the price of what i normally pay for it and not significantly better (if at all). Also bummed that they didnt have the fried fish as an option because thats always my go to.

We also got the viet coffee and although it was *cool* that it came in the traditional vietnamese filter and all, it was a ridiculously small portion, especially for a higher price point than normal.

All in all, don't see myself ever returning here when there are a plethora of comparable and cheaper options.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

BoCaphe,"I'll be honest, I am often left feeling ""meh"" when I go to hyped-up Vietnamese places.  I end up getting a banh mi and think it was good, but in the end, it was a sandwich.  Big deal.

I went in to BoCaphe with the same feeling, TBH.  Then add my seafood allergy which kills off a lot of the menu because of fish oils in a lot of the dishes.  Grumble, grumble.

We got some appetizers, spring rolls were good.  I got a chicken and rice bowl.  I was expecting very little, its a chicken and rice bowl.  However, it was very good.  There was plenty of chicken and the peanut sauce was delicious and it was dressed perfectly such that there wasn't a pool of sauce drowning the rice.  

The service was very good and the vibe of the place is definitely SoHo / LES chic.  Go, you will love it.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Was pretty hesitant at first after looking at the portion to price ratio but after ordering and finishing our meal, this place did not disappoint! Service was really good and attentive. We ordered the bo bun vermicelli noodle with beef and lemon grass. Very tasty and filling with lots of beef and amazing bold flavors. The beef bao bun with medium rare beef was cooked to perfection and was so juicy! Amazing alternative concept to a regular burger. Finally, the best part of all of it was the taro fries. Very crispy, fresh, and highly addicting. So i would say the price was met with quality and flavor.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"This is such an adorable, cozy, welcoming spot - nothing like the snooty spots in nearby Soho.

The broth in the classic pho is so flavorful and tastes healthier than most pho's, while the savory and sweet black pepper beef dish was so delicious.

Definitely come on a cold day and get the pho (the taro fries were just okay, tasted like plantains). I definitely wanna try their Vietnamese coffee next time.

5 stars!!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Not sure if it was because I got delivery but it was literally the most tasteless pho I've ever had. The soup and the meat were flavorless. I also got the shrimp summer roll and the peel was semi hard hence stale. It was also a tiny roll split in half, most places offer two rolls. The only dish that was decent was the egg banh mi. The pho was overpriced as well. I was disappointed since I've heard so many rave reviews, maybe I'll give it another shot some other time.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Came here randomly with some friends for dinner. A fusion restaurant that you can definitely tell from their menu; I got the chicken and ginger vermicelli noodle bowl.

It was a good bowl of noodles but nothing amazing to be honest. I would say the quality of ingredients used is slightly higher than what you would expect from the usual Vietnamese places you find in Chinatown but that's about it.

The interior and decor is very very pretty though and totally instagrammable in my opinion. Overall vibe and mood is great too.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"When I think of having Vietnamese, I immediately refer to Ctown or maybe downtown Flushing, but Soho would not be my first guess. BoCaphe I would say would be more Asian fusion if pressed to categorize it.

Seeking to avoid the maddening gridlock crowds of the San Genarro Feast nearby, we had our brunch here on a beautiful Summer day.

I had the lemongrass beef on rice. The flavor of the marinated beef was dark and intense with a hint of sweetness. Another reviewer considered this salty, but I did not, especially relative to meat dishes I would have at other Vietnamese restaurants. In my opinion, it was delicious and different. My wife suggested I taste the sauce. I usually forego doing that, thinking the prepared serving should speak for itself, but in this case I scraped every bit from my plate.

The sautéed vegetables,that I had mistaken for a small salad came in the bowl and was delicate but was completed when the dressing was spooned over it.

My one criticism is that the serving of saffron rice was too small.

A four and a half star rating would fit, if not for my wife just giving her rainbow quinoa bowl an ok. It was gluten - free, though. She did like the aesthetics of the restaurant and the food presentation, as both were pleasingly colorful.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"I bookmarked this business long ago based on the stellar 1000+ reviews averaging 4 solid stars on Yelp. Although my dinner was good, it didn't knock my socks off.

In the area, i referred to my many bookmarked spots on Yelp and since I was dining solo, decided to check this one out.
Very cute interior/ambiance and with the warm weather still on tap, sidewalk seating was also available.

I took a seat inside right at the bar and viewed the menu which seemed diverse serving juices, smoothies, brunch, lunch and dinner , Vietnamese style.
Creative cocktails seemed interesting, but I chose a delicious Rose ($11).

As I looked over the menu, I settled on a rice vermicelli dish. Chicken and ginger.  This traditional dish combines cold noodles with a warm topping.
The serving size was adequate but in my opinion, definitely overpriced at $17.
One of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in Greenwich Village,  serves this dish for substantially less.  

The flavors were good and included shredded carrots, cucumbers, lettuce integrated with chicken lying on top the vermicelli. The traditional dressing for this dish was included. I  really didn't taste much ginger and ran out of the chicken 2/3 of the way before fishing my meal.

Overall, I did enjoy it but was expecting something more spectacular or on another level regarding Vietnamese fare, especially for their menu prices.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"The vibe in this restaurant is so so fun and cute. It's pretty small inside, so definitely not the place to go for larger parties, but it was perfect for my group of 3. The food was very yummy as well! I enjoyed my shrimp spring roll, and the chicken in the green papaya chicken salad was delicious. There menu is also so friendly for those who are being health conscious with options for cauliflower rice and zucchini noodles. I got the salmon rice bowl with cauliflower rice and it was a nice filling meal. The salmon wasn't the best I've ever had as it was a tad salty.

BoCaphe,"This place is so cute!! It kept coming up in my Yelp search results for lunch in the area, and I decided I had to check it out. I came here for lunch around 12pm with one other person and we got seated right when we arrived. What we got:

Chicken & ginger rice noodles - This is what I got, and it came with the perfect amount of sauce and a fried spring roll. The spring roll had a great crunch to it and was reminiscent of ones I had in Hanoi. The noodle dish was flavorful and well proportioned - I finished my entire bowl. I loved the sauce (I think it was lime fish sauce but I'm not sure). The ginger was more of a hint than a flavor in its own right, which is what I prefer anyway.

Tofu and vegetable rice noodles - My dining companion loved this, it even came with a vegetarian sauce made without fish!

Our food came really fast and everything tasted fresh. Service was great and I loved how many menu choices there were. Give this place a try next time you're in the area!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"*****VERY EXPENSIVE*****

The stars are based on the price and not the taste. If it was based on the taste they would get 5 stars. I ordered the caramelized bao and pho classic. The baos were $7 each and we ordered four! Haha the baos were incredible! Not sure what sauce they used but it's packed with flavor. We each got a pho classic and that was priced at $17. The pho was good to me, my wife said it was sweeter than most bowls of pho. I enjoyed the broth and thought it had a good flavor. I mostly enjoyed the noodles. They tasted very fresh and were cut thinner than other places. They also add celery to their pho but you don't even taste it. Overall I would say the food is great, worth the price of $70, I don't think so. I've gotten better bowls of pho for $9. Oh one more thing, we were full from having four baos but the pho was one size, it was a smaller bowl. If we didn't have the baos I would have been able to have two more bowls of pho. Which would be a problem if you're paying $34 for two bowls of pho just for yourself? My wife said it was expensive because of the area we were in ‍",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Interesting fusion food but not worth the price for its portions.

Food/Drink: I got the black pepper beef rice noodle salad. It was very tasty but the portion was quite small, I wasn't able to be very full from it. I've never had french-vietnamese fusion food before so it was definitely an interesting taste, however not something you'd go back to often.

Price: A bowl of noodle salad was around $12-14 depending your add ons. Like I said earlier, this is a pretty hefty price for the amount of food you're getting in the bowl.

Atmosphere: I loved the atmosphere here it had a half and half vibe of hip french restaurant and rustic Vietnamese park.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"I'd definitely say it's Vietnamese inspired at best.

The food is so disappointing. I got their highly popular black pepper beef bun and it was soooooo unappetizing. The flavor on the meat was off-putting. I also wish that their seasoning/fish sauce was more flavorful, it felt very watered down.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Chicken ginger crispy spring rolls are a must!! I'm salivating thinking about it. Taro fries were interesting. My friends loved them! I ordered the chicken pho and the broth was delicious. It had celery, carrots, and shredded chicken. I wish the chicken was not shredded and mixed in the soup since i felt like it made the chicken dry. But overall, great food. I would still order it again!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"This was one of the most disappointing culinary experiences I've had in a long time. My friends and I (5 of us in total) were pretty excited to try out some trendy Vietnamese food one summer night. However, nearly everything let us down.

First off, the menu was pretty overpriced. $5 for one single spring roll is just absurd, and $7 for a bun is also crazy. $17 for regular pho that was in no way special was maybe the worst offender. This pho, while not particularly bad in any way, was probably the least inspiring noodle soup I've had in my life. The portions were small, broth was not exactly flavorful, and they really skimped on ingredients and the side additions that allow you to customize your own pho. I had like 4 bean sprouts - probably could've grown more myself in the time we had to eat this meal. My friend asked for more onions and they didn't even know what that was (like it's in the soup c'mon). We also got taro fries for appetizers, which were mostly bland and flavorless as well.

The service was also lacking - I hate to criticize because they seemed like nice enough people, but I'm just not sure why it takes 20+ minutes to bring out pho, which takes like 20 seconds to assemble. It also took a long time for them to take my credit card despite us sitting in front of the machine.

In conclusion, I would not go to this restaurant if you're looking for some good pho. There's so many other options in the area to consider!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"came here for brunch over the weekend and I have to say we were pleased with everything we order. The cocktails are affordable, but the presentation and flavors were on point! You have a fair fusion of some close-to-authentic vietnamese dishes and some americanized brunch items like the taro fries and salmon bao sandwich. Everything would be recommended, especially if you are also looking for a quaint ambiance.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

The Drinks Rose Belle: Rose wine, pink grapefruit, fresh strawberries Lychee Martini: Vodka, rosewater, lychee, mint
.
.
Food For appetizer we shared a classic pho! I can still savor every spoon. we also received a taste of the Crispy Spring Rolls with quinoa. .
.
I had a rice bowl with beef truffle and shiitake, I substituted my rice for cauliflower rice. The peanut sauce was a great touch. .

Dessert Famous Chocolate Mousse: Avocado chocolate mousse with fresh strawberries

BoCaphe,"Probably more of a 3.5, but rounding up because of its unique choices!

Food (Beef Bao Burger + Taro fries) - 3.5
Price vs. worth - 3
Ambience- 4
Service - 4.5

BoCaphe is what happens when you take Asian food (in this case Vietnamese cuisine) & then try to cater it to Western culture to make it insta-worthy. It very much fits into the SoHo neighborhood where it's located - it's trendy inside with murals and plants hanging on the ceiling, and its menu has a bunch of vegan options (+ a juice/smoothie section?!)

I didn't want to order the pho, especially knowing I can get one for a fraction of the price just a couple blocks away, so I got their bao burger. My friends ordered the chicken & ginger vermicelli and the beef vermicelli. In my opinion, you can't really go wrong with bao items - the bun makes EVERYTHING taste at least semi-decent. I wasn't wrong here either! The burger was cooked medium-rare, but nothing really special. But I looooved the bao bun that came with it. Seriously, I might have a bao bun obsession, I don't know, but I'm not sure I want to address it right now or ever. The taro fries were also unique and delicious with the dipping sauce it came with.

The service was pretty attentive the whole time, always making sure we had everything we needed. It wasn't crazy busy when we went, despite it being Sunday evening. And at the end, they gave our check in a full volume Voltaire book (I did say it was trendy!)

Overall I enjoyed the experience, but if you're looking for incredible and authentic Vietnamese food, I'd say you can go elsewhere and pay a lot less.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Meh. Came to try it because there were so many reviews and it looked cute but when I came here for brunch I just left disappointed. The pho was just too expensive and for a small bowl too. I got the eggs, potatoes, and turkey bacon. Everything was so mediocre and just tasted meh.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"I came on a weekend looking for some tasty brunch and found this unique location offering French vietnamese.

For the history buffs out there, there is a deep history between Vietnam and France- hence the bahn mi being served in a French Baguette.

Maybe I had extremely high expectations for a mind blowing gastronomic experience. Unfortunately I did not.

The food does its job, it is food and fills you up. It just did not have anything spectacular or memorable with each dish. It is far from French food or Vietnamese food. It is your exact definition of Asian fusion. I am sure if you do not have a tongue for either French food or Vietnamese food this place would be amazing- as it is different. BUT for my French or Vietnamese foodies out there- if you are in downtown manhattan... there are a whole host of amazing French or Vietnamese spots around!

Parking- Sunday and evenings free! But any other day/ time... good luck
Cleanliness- very
Service- friendly

Love it or dump it- I would have a quick fling- but far from wifey material.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Overpriced for the food you get.

Food: I ordered the beef and lemongrass vermicelli, which was good, but overpriced ($17). The beef was good quality and there was a good amount of food, but I probably wouldn't come back again. Maybe the brunch is a better option since that's what they advertise.

Service: Pretty good, they gave us water while we were waiting for our table.

Atmosphere: It had a cool, hip, atmosphere. It's partially outdoors and no AC, which made it hot and sticky inside.

It was an interesting place, but I probably wouldn't go back again. Definitely overhyped and overpriced. The ratings are probably skewed to their favor because they offer free dessert if you write them a review.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"If you're looking for a cool hip brunch place then do come here. The food is acarrear but the vibe is great. The food is on a semi healthy side so you can sub for cauliflower rice and zoodles for rice bowls and pho. We got the black pepper beef which was good and the beef truffle shiitake which was pretty good as well. The drinks are a bit too sweet for me so I was diluting it down with water. Overall, a cool place to hang out on a weekend. They have a semi open roof space in the back with high top tables and cool wall arts. I think it's a great place to hang out and chill on the weekend but if you love food I would go to a real pho place. If you want something on the healthy side this place might be good for you.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Fresh food, burger is super juicy and tasty and would highly recommend with the taro fries (drool!) which add a nice twist and interesting texture to normal potato fries.

Vermicelli noodles with raw salmon was also an interesting combo and good on a very hot summer day, however I'll prob get the burger again next time I stop in. Or maybe I'll try the beef with shiitake over rice?

I'm getting hungry writing this review....

Cramped space, but worth stopping in if you're in the area and craving viet food with a twist.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Okay, so I went again since I loved my experience from last time. My friends and I ended up leaving the place without even ordering food. My friend went to use the restroom before ordering as we were waiting for my other friend to arrive. Their restroom was horrendous and next to the kitchen so after my friend came out of the restroom, we ended up leaving. Logically speaking, if your restroom is disgusting and not well maintained I wonder how the kitchen is like.

I don't think I'll be coming back!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"One of the few places which are open on christmas day for brunch. I got the vietnamese style omelette with potatoes and papaya salad. My friends got the bao bun benedict with lox and the veggie rice bowl. We even got taro fries to share and vietnamese hot coffees. The papaya salad's concelt was a nice fresh addition to a breakfast in my mind and I thought I would like the twist. My friend's lox bao bun was recommended but the bun seemed a tad undercooked to me. The vegetables in the rice bowl were amazing, they had the street food kind of vibe and were super delicious. The taro fries were good, we got a truffle sauce on the side for $3 which was underwhelming. The coffees were ok, i've had better vietnamese coffee. The filters were traditional but a few didnt have the double filter and they leaked some little particles into the coffee.

I was surprised that they didnot have a non-fish option for the papaya salad dressing or the peanut sauce. They gave me a replacement which was not mixed in kind of useless. Thye did have the zoodles and cauliflower rice as low carb options for meals which was a plus. May or maynot return due to numerous other options. The not so smooth coffee and the underwhelming sauces/salad made it 3 stars for me.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"So I'll open with I have always loved BoCaphe. It's been a long time favorite, and I've enjoyed the food. HOWEVER, I just ordered from UberEATS and could not be more horrified. I took the food out and opened the spring roll box and a LIVE cockroach or whatever this creature was that you see in the image ran out. I was freaking out and had to kill it. I immediately reported this to UberEATS and plan to contact the health department to do an investigation. I'm mentally nauseous from the experience and just praying I don't get sick. I get that this is NY... but this not okay and I'd like to avoid insect infestations and food poisoning.

BoCaphe,"This is a modern Vietnamese restaurant with a bit of a fusion-inspired menu. I tried the caramelized grass-fed beef bao bun, shrimp summer roll (goi cuon), green papaya chicken salat (goi), and chicken ginger crispy spring roll (cha gio). I thought everything was a-ok so I debated between 3-4 stars. I liked all of the Vietnamese flavors and but would have enjoyed if the papaya salad had more flavor to the salad portion. The meat was greatly seasoned but the salad part was mild in the nuoc mam (fish sauce) flavor. The salad actually tasted like a banh mi thit (Vietnamese sandwich) without the baguette. The papaya was julienned and was thicker than traditional thinly shredded papaya seen in Vietnamese salad (goi). There was just as much as there was papaya so it made me think I was eating pickled carrot and daikon (do chua) rather than goi. I am still unsure if there was green papaya or if it was all daikon. The shrimp roll was good but the peanut sauce was slightly thinner than I would have liked. I didn't care for the ginger chicken egg roll that much because the ingredients inside were a bit chunky. The salad was $17, which I thought was pricy. The ginger chicken roll was $5 and was one roll cut into two pieces. The shrimp roll was $8 for a single roll (cut into two pieces). I thought everything was definitely pricy for the quantity. The bun was a fusion of Chinese and Vietnamese cuisine. They have an all day breakfast menu.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Service is great, food presentation is amaze, music is v upbeat and fun.  My one eh factor was that drinks were weak.  ON NEW YEARS EVE!  C'mon now!

The third time, we ordered a few cocktails: ho chi mint, pink mojito, and belle piscini. I loved the ho chi mint, but the pink mojito was too sweet. The belle piscini was very strong but the flavor was lovely anyway. We also ordered mama tom, sweet and sour shrimp vermicelli noodles, and salmon vermicelli noodles.

I got the Egg Bowl with turkey bacon and bleh this is the first time I couldn't even finish my meal. It was that bad. First of all, the food wasn't even hot when it came out. It felt like it was sitting outside for a couple hours. Potatoes were cold, egg was super bland, veggies weren't fresh, and the turkey bacon was hard. Everything tasted microwaved.

My friends got the Egg Bahn Mi and the Bao Benedict, which didn't look nor taste good. I'm really hoping their lunch or dinner is better, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Cons: it's a pretty high noise level full of loudish hipsters (but I'm an old lady so....) , and kinda packed in like sardines ( but most NYC restaurants are....).

Tips: shishito peppers are perfection and the homemade sake is a deal ( a glass is huge).

Bottom line: if you don't want to feel gross and like you have to roll yourself home, love veggies and appreciate the flavors of Vietnamese food, you should be here now.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

It looked like they were enjoying the late afternoon lull, but even with almost no customers, the service was quite slow. We had to go find someone to seat us all the way back into the restaurant and they didn't even come over with menus until 10 min later.

We ended up ordering some apps to share - two buns and the summer rolls. Even not expecting that much in terms of quantity - the plates were minuscule. And for the quality of the food - average not great and definitely under seasoned - my friend and I felt a little ripped off.

If you want to feel ignored and have some muted flavors in a very esthetically pleasing space - this is for you!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"So I reserved through Yelp, arrived early, and was seated promptly and not made to wait until my reservation time which was nice.

I ordered the Ho Chi Mint off the drink menu, because puns (!!). And it was pretty good. I don't know that I would typically go for a sake based cocktail but this was a cool blend of pineapple and mint and their house sake that went well with the Classic Pho. Definitely appreciated the beef:noodle:broth:herb ratio. Broth wasn't super flavorful though...

The one thing I thought was a *little* weird is their Chicken Pho. Not weird bad, just my family tried it and it was definitely more like a chicken noodle soup. They put carrots in it? Not wrong I guess but definitely weird. So yeah if you want traditional pho, get the classic one.

Atmosphere/ambience super cute. Very tiny but there's two group tables that seat 8 in the back so larger groups are possible.

I'm giving it 3 stars just because 1) I've had better in the area, I'll be honest. 2) Not enough legit pho options.

She wanted to sit in the back but the server said it is for only a big party. After we ordered everything, our service forgot our drinks order so we had to asked another server to follow up our drinks.

Food is regular taste, maybe we gad too highly expectation from reading such a nice review from yelp. Salmon is not do fresh, my friend is a raw fish lover so she can tell which fresh which is not.

It is a Vietnamese fusion restaurant and the prices definitely reflect that. The pho dishes are in the $15-20 range, which is quite different than your cheap bowl of pho at local Vietnamese restaurants. Overall, the pho was fine - not the best pho I've ever had, not the worst pho I've ever had. I'm not sure if I really tasted the fusion aspect. Service was great, despite the restaurant being super busy and crowded. The tables are like long benches and shared, which isn't my favorite type of environment.

The food, however, is a bit lacking. My friend and I ordered the Beef Rice Bowl and the Beef Pho. I thought the Beef Rice Bowl was a bit too heavy on the sauce. My friend's pho had undercooked noodles. While the waiter was kind to bring a second bowl of pho, the noodles were still very undercooked. They were so hard that it was almost inedible.

The vibe inside Bocaphe is young and hip, casual, with cool decorations. The space in the restaurant is quite tight, but they manage to fit in alot of tables. Looking around, everyone seemed to have quite large portions and the food looked really good.

I ordered the green papaya chicken salad and my friend got the veggies and tofu bo bun. I actually was looking for a lighter dish and thus was surprised when my salad came out with a very large amount of chicken. It seemed like my salad was alot more of chicken than papaya. But overall the flavor was very good, just more meat than I expected. My friend had the opposite problem. She agreed that her bo bun had great flavors but she was able to count 5 small pieces of tofu which was a bit disappointing.

The ambience was nice and although the food leans more on the expensive side, the portions they give are fairly good and it's filling. For a party of 7, we didn't need to wait too long, but it took way too long, longer than we expected to actually get the food out.

All the savory breakfast options are really good, but I would stay away from the pho only because there's so many more inexpensive options nearby in Chinatown and surrounding areas.

They advertise free dessert for a Yelp review, but it's false. The server Amyn (?) said he was ""too busy"" to get us the dessert.

Second, even though you are paying such amount of gratitude, the service there is rude and there is absolute no service until you ask for a check or a menu.

We got the chicken and ginger spring roll and it was incredibly crispy and bursting with flavor. I also got the black tea which was very refreshing.

BoCaphe,"Everything is flavorful, delicious and as an added benefit, HEALTHY. I came here for dinner last night with a friend who's vegan, and I just have to say that we got the best of both worlds. Apps that were veggie friendly, and entrees that worked for us separately (I love meat).

For starters, we got the cucumbers (YUM), the shishito peppers (also YUM), the taro fries (meh, I'd say skip) and the summer rolls (shrimp for me, veggie for her). The summer rolls were so so so so good.  

As for our main, we opted for Pho. I got the classic, and she the vegan style. The broth was sheer heaven and those noodles were cooked to absolute perfection. We capped dinner off with the mango sorbet, which was wonderfully refreshing. Oh, and the XL carafe of infused sake didn't hurt either.

My only gripe is how small the tables are in relation to the plates. It took the kitchen no time flat to deliver all of our apps at the same time, and while I appreciated the speediness factor, we just plan ran out of room! They also seemed quite anxious to come clear our plates, despite the fact that we were still working on our dish.

I scraped the dirt off the plate to show the server but he didn't care and walked away. See the photo for the contrast between the clean spoon and the dirty plate. No wonder they have a B health grade...

The portions are small, the food is average, the service is awful and we were served our pho in dirty plates.

Avoid this place at all cost.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Came here for my bday brunch with friends on a Sunday. It was pretty busy but we thankfully didn't have to wait for too long. The service however was EXTREMELY slow and RUDE!! the waiters gave us a lot of attitude when we just asked about the free dessert that they wrongly advertise and automatically put down 20% gratuity that we definitely did not want to pay for.

When we were done, i asked for them to wrap up my leftovers and it took them over THIRTY MINUTES to do so! No matter how busy a restaurant is, how could it take that long to put half a sandwich into a to-go box? Not to mention that we had to remind them TWICE to bring it out...

Food and atmosphere were nice but service is something they are really lacking - made my overall experience here meh",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,Tiny place with great ambiance and the Vegan Pho is delicious.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Came here for dinner -- a very LA vibe with all of the hanging plants, light bulbs, and neon lights in a pretty dark setting. It's great for a date or a small group (tables are pretty small and place isn't that big!). We got a vegan pho and the classic pho, both of which were solid -- the portion size is much smaller than you'd find in Chinatown, but that was fine for us.

Drinks were good, I'd recommend the Ho Chi Mint, which came in a mason jar and was smooth/refreshing. Also def get the vegan chocolate lava cake! So good.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"My girlfriend and I decided to come here to try the pho because we heard a lot of great things about this place!  

Service: the waiters are very quick and seated us very quickly. I enjoyed the tap water with mint leafs. It really changes it up!

Food: the classic Pho is $16.00 and I really enjoy how the placements is like. Usually you will get a plate with the lemon and vegetables, but instead they have it in the bottom of the plate with the dish.

Overall: great place to try!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,We went to BoCaphe for our first breakfast/lunch in NYC. The restaurant was very cute and great for taking pics while waiting for our food. I was really hungry so I got the black pepper beef vermicelli and it filled me up. It came with a little spring roll that was really good and the noodle dish was good.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"My friends and I had a reservation at 6:30 PM on a Friday and we were running a bit late, but they were nice enough to keep our table. Their decor is really cute and has a nice hip ambiance.

I ordered the taro fries and classic pho. The taro fries were really tasty! They were nice and crispy and the inside was really soft. Paired with the spicy mayo dipping sauce, it was really good. The classic pho was not salty (a good thing) and the noodles didn't break apart. I do wish they had the other cuts of meat, but I know this restaurant is tailored for the American palate.

Overall I would come back and try their bun bo next time!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"I woulda gave them four stars, but the service is pretty bad here. I was so happy to try to place too, but the service made it a bad experience for me.

Their staff members are always talking to one another or on their phone. When I first stepped in, I was wondering where the host was. Apparently, she was the one sitting on the bar with her phone. She didn't notice my friend and I until we walked further in into the restaurant.

My friend and I were waiting for a check for about 20 mins, but the waiter didn't even notice because he was busy talking to his friends that came in. If he wasn't talking to them he was talking to the other staff members.

On the other hand, I had the class pho with zucchini noodles & I was happy with it. If you are on a low carb diet, you should try this place. But be warn their customer service pretty bad.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Good service. My pho was well-made. The broth was very flavorful with a nice balance of beefiness and spice flavors. There were lots of herbs, including sawtooth coriander (which I don't often see served with pho). The noodles were al dente, the meat was of good quality, and the bean sprouts had more flavor than one usually gets from bean sprouts.

However, portions were extraordinarily stingy. For $17, the bowl was small and the quantity of meat was seriously lacking. Rents are high in this neighborhood, but the portion size was insulting for the price.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"I ordered two crisp spring rolls (Chicken'Ginger and Vach Ki Ri Crisp, $4.5 each), and Green Papaya Chicken salad ($16). Crisp rolls were yummy but I could not taste ginger and were smaller than I expected for the price. Chickens in salad are well seasoned and have a good texture but papaya did not have much taste.

I got a complimentary chocolate mousse dessert ($8) for leaving a yelp review. It was delicious. I would order again in the future.

In general although food is good, I feel it is overpriced. Bathroom was dirty.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"My first impression walking into this place is that it is super instagram friendly - pink lights, leafy decor, very curated walls. We got seated right away with a group of 3 at 11:30 - on the earlier side of brunch in Manhattan but still impressive. I got the Egg Banh Mi which was very filling and tasty, although I will say it didn't taste as authentic to traditional banh mi with the egg replacing the meat, but that's to be expected with the breakfast take BoCaphe took on the food. Def not cheap ($15) but a price I was willing to pay for a filling meal. I wish I got the beef vermicelli noodles instead, as my friend got them and I tried them and really liked them!

Would come back for the vermicelli!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Pho was solid and my fav was the taro fries !
My only question is why I haven't had taro fries sooner!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Bocaphe is a fast casual Vietnamese fusion spot that has an inviting and cozy atmosphere. The menu has the most of the expected Vietnamese dishes like the dry vermicelli noodle dish with your choice of protein, pho (classic beef, chicken, and VEGAN!), spring rolls, and baos. They also have a great sounding cocktail selection, but most of the drinks are sake based. The appearance of the drinks are super cute, but the drink i got was underwhelming and a bit watery but my friends all enjoyed their drinks. The restaurant doesn't have too much seating so make a reservation or come early! They do delivery so that's always a nice option.

Regarding the food:

Classic pho: lacking in flavor in my opinion and can probably come with more bean sprouts than it comes with, but I also didn't try to ask for extra. The broth is just ok and tasted watered down. The only protein is a normal steak round I believe, so don't expect any of the other things like brisket etc.

Taro fries: my favorite thing here! This dish is what earned this place its 3 stars honestly. I personally love taro anything so deep fried taro is no exception. The fries come with a fun spicy sriracha mayo-like dip.

Sweet rolls (dessert): it was like a fried egg roll with Nutella, peanuts, and a mango dip?? Was very confused by this dessert honestly not sure if it was good or just strange. The dish comes with 3 small egg rolls for $8.

Saigreen (cucumber, lime, jalapeño, sake): I wasn't in the mood for anything too sweet, so I opted for the Saigreen which sounded interesting in its description, but the drink tasted sooo watered down even though I took a sip right when they brought the drink out. For $13, I expected some substance in the drink.

Overall I like the atmosphere, but would probably not come here for drinks and classic pho. I love that they have vegan and vegetarian friendly options, so I might come back to try the vegan pho!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"I really  dig this place, the decor is on point (tropical meets French grunge). the music was  the perfect background to go with my delicious lunch and momentarily transported me away from city life and had me  envisioning my next vacation! We came on Saturday midday, I made a reservation but it didn't seem necessary as there were plenty of seats when we arrived. It was a sunny day so they had the front windows wide and a few seats outside. It's a small space inside but they make good use of it. Multicolored neon lights and French sayings plaster the ceilings and walls. My brunch mate had the bao salmon Benedict  (because where  else can you find a bao Benedict?!) and said it was pretty delicious. I had the chicken & ginger bowl with cauliflower over rice. It's served with a scrumptious peanut sauce and if you add a dash of hot sauce it's the perfect combination of spice and bountiful flavor! I seriously loved my food, and it was a large portion! I unfortunately couldn't finish. We also had two Vietnamese coffees, which, let's face it are more about having a fun time than Drinking coffee. To top it off they had a clean bathroom. Will absolutely be back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Man was I disappointed. I had ordered the shrimp summer rolls, beef pho, taro fries, and a cocktail for delivery. Similar to what another reviewer experienced, what I got instead was a single veggie summer roll that had basically fallen apart into a lame salad. The sliced beef was packed in the broth, making it chewy and tough by the time it arrived; any legit Viet spot will know to keep the beef separate. The broth itself was super bland and the portion of noodles was TINY. Taro fries and cocktail were alright, thus the 2 stars. But even that is generous, considering I spent $60 and am still hungry.

I get that businesses are going through hard times. But as a restaurant whose whole value proposition seems to be to ""elevate"" commoner food by calling it French-Vietnamese (ah, the glory days of colonialism!), being in a trendy area, and slapping on a price tag DOUBLE what you pay in Chinatown, you could at least not cut corners so blatantly... As for the lack of flavor-- I'll just pin that on lack of taste.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Whyyyyy is this place so small. Remove some tables or figure out a better way to arrange the floor.
No waiting area; there's barely any walking area.

Have been here twice. Both occasions, the servers couldn't reach our table because the walkways were so narrow. I had to reach across another table to receive our dishes.

The girl next to me during my last visit. We might as well have been sitting together because of how close we were. Not to mention that she was coughing up a storm and bc the vicinity was so close, I had my side/back/food away from her as much as I could.

The cleaning staff came too early and had their hands on my bowl assuming I was done but was not. Had to tell her that I still wasn't done

The water carafes have mint leaves in them but even at brunch, the mint leaves look so wilted and overrun. No, the water doesn't taste like mint.

The food is just ok. Not amazing but if you're looking for Americanized Vietnamese/Thai, you can come here",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"The food was good. I particularly enjoyed the salad. The salmon was fresh and the omelette had a good flavor. However the eggs were a little over cooked, and the potatoes were soft. Overall the food was not Vietnamese or French so it left me a little confused.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,Awesome food and ambiance. Pho is so flavorful and the beef and lemongrass vermicelli was flavorful and aromatic. It's a nice hole in the wall and I will definitely be coming back. The interior was decorated very nicely.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"My friend and I got an early brunch a little after 10am on a weekend. By the time we left around 11:45, the restaurant was fuller, but there were still a few seats left. The interior is very unique. I love the use of lights. The space is a bit tight, but the mirror along one side of the wall helps make the restaurant feel a little larger.

The vibe is very chill. Service was a bit spotty, but it was tolerable. The menu is laid out very clearly with a few options within a few categories. My friend got the vegan pho, and I got the Bao Benedict.

The vegan pho came out in a huge bowl and platter with lots of greens. That being said, I found it a little underwhelming in terms of flavor. My Bao Benedict was certainly unique, but the hollandaise was a little more sour than I usually like it. The side of the veggies was a nice complement  with the runny eggs.

Overall a cute vibe, but the food didn't blow me out of the water.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"I've been to this restaurant three times: two for dinner and once for brunch. As far as quality of food, it's pretty good Vietnamese fare with that hipster flare. You can get your pho, vermicelli bowls, banh mi, etc., but all at a NYC price of course. $17-19 for Vietnamese food is a bit pricey for my taste. You can't beat the location though.

Just another note, in the summer they don't have a/c which is drawback since the place is pretty tiny.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Ummmm definitely have had better. The summer rolls here were so bad and overpriced. Seriously don't order it. ONE piece for $8. And the skin was so hard I couldn't bite into it and had to send it back. Inside was just vegetables and no vermicelli. Not authentic at all.

The vegan pho wasn't too bad. The broth was tasty but it was actually not that hot when it came out. Pho is supposed to be nice and hot. Plus the noodles were on the soggy/ overcooked side. It was $15- very very overpriced.

The best thing I had here was actually the taro fries. They were super yummy. Also the service was pretty good. They took my complaint of the summer roll seriously and didn't charge me for it.

Pros for this place would be the cute decor and presentation of food. The plates and stuff are all pretty cute. Great for Instagram, not so great for taste.

I still wouldn't come back because you can get much better and cheaper Vietnamese food somewhere else.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

BoCaphe,"I love the ambiance and vibe in here. It's super duper cute and it's a cool concept of Vietnamese-French fusion (definitely brings history back into your head too).

Even though the decor and ambiance is super cool here, I would say the food is alright. I ordered the classic pho and I was really disappointed. The classic pho lacked a lot of the rich and authentic aroma of broth. The broth was more bland and lack the richness and comfort feel. The pho isn't wasn't amazing. I was very disappointed by that even though I didn't envision it being 100% authentic.

I also had the chicken ginger spring roll and shishito peppers and I think the shishito peppers were delicious! The chicken ginger spring roll was not bad but didn't make me love it. I would come back here for a quick little snack but I wouldn't come here for more than that. Maybe I would give a second chance in trying other entrees.. but I think I'm okay with the pho..",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

He didn't like the sauce at all.  I tried a little and passed on the sauce too.  My other son had the chicken with bun with fish sauce and he didn't like the chicken it loved my sisters dish.  My sister ordered beef with lemongrass and cauliflower rice. The papaya salad was cut too thick.  The watermelon juice had an odd aftertaste.  

The people who worked there were super nice and, again, the taro fries were really good.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

BoCaphe,"Awful service. Let me chronicle the series of events. We arrived for a Sunday lunch and put our name in. We were pleasantly surprised that our quoted wait time was 10-20 minutes. Confusingly, the ""host"" did not take our name down which made me wonder how he was keeping track of everyone. The restaurant decor was quirky and beautiful with its modern interpretation of Southeast Asian art. We were seated on schedule thereafter. That's where it all went down hill.

After placing our orders, we waited nearly 1.5 hours to even get our appetizers! The waiter explained to use the kitchen was slow today because they had a new chef. Ok....the waiter was kind enough to offer us complimentary drinks to compensate for the ridiculous wait time but we just wanted our food! After receiving appetizers, our finished, dirty plates sat on the table for a solid 20 minutes before we had to ask someone to take them away. Because we were seated by the door, we also witnessed a group continuously get told to wait outside in the cold long after their quoted 20 minute wait time was passed. Across the restaurant, you could see patrons were not happy. The food was fine. Our table got a combination of pho, vermicelli, and the bahn mi. Definitely not worth the wait.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

BoCaphe,"I wanted to love this place but it fell flat for me. Service was good but sitting by the crowded bar in somewhat awkward chairs took away from the ambiance. Everything we had from drinks to food had really intense flavors (you might like it if you like very salty food and acidic drinks). I had to water down the iced tea that I got, which was good for detoxing I guess. The omelet had chunks of unmelted cheese and mushrooms. The vermicelli with lemongrass beef was not bad since the beef soaked up all the sauce. But there was so much mint and mint, you want to be careful and not pour in the entire fish sauce serving that they give you. This might be the place for you if you love Asian fusion!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"4 stars are given based on ambiance, service and food.

Ambiance: fun little place. Definitely a modern take on a vietnamese restaurant. The restaurant appears to be artist with the wall arts and plants. However, the seating is uncomfortable and too close together. Probably wouldn't go back to eat in, but rather to take out.

Service: nothing special, but the waitress for informative and quick. I had asked what they were known for and she said pho and vermicelli noodles. I tried the vermicelli and my brother tried the pho. The cups seemed a bit scratched up, could be from the way it was cleaned. The water they provided has a minty taste which was pleasant.

Food: the food was delicious. Very filling. Flavorful. We definitely enjoyed the food and although the bowl seemed smaller than traditional vietnamese restaurants, it was filling.

I would definitely return for the food and order for take out.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Overall, very overpriced and mediocre food - will definitely not come back because nothing was special.

Ambiance (2/5) - Nice decor and hipster but extremely cramped. It almost felt shoulder-to-shoulder in the restaurant.

Service (3/5) - We made a reservation for 8 on a Monday at 6pm. We were seated promptly and throughout the meal, the servers were attentive and respectful. Service was as expected.

Food (1/5) - Overpriced for average food.

Original Pho: Small bowl, tasted like normal pho. Just had noodles and beef. No tendon, tripe, etc. For $17 I was expecting something much much more. Do yourself a favor and go to Chinatown and get a bowl of pho for $8 that's twice the size. Or if you want a specialty bowl of pho (short rib), go somewhere else.

Taro Fries: Best thing we ordered. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Also comes with a creamy spicy dipping sauce.

Bao Bun: $7 for a SINGLE bao that was tasteless. Definitely skip this if you decide to come. The meat was flavorless and the pickled vegetables weren't even pickled. All I tasted was the hoisin sauce and store-bought bun...

Beef lemongrass vermicelli bowl: Barely passable and nothing special. Again, for $18, this is definitely not worth the price point. Beef was not very flavorful and I did not taste any lemongrass. The bowl was filled with a lot of veggies. The spring roll that comes with the bowl was very tasty but the size of a small thumb.

All in all, I will not come back as there are some many other restaurants in the city which are tastier and/or are more value for food. I'm shocked people rate this restaurant so highly....",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

BoCaphe,"Okay so I've been here once before and I had a great experience. So Friday I brought two friends there for lunch time. It was pretty empty there so we got seated right away. We sat outside.

I got the vegan pho ($15), my friend got the classic pho ($17), and my sister got the beef truffle rice bowl ($19).

My sister inhaled her beef truffle rice bowl she was super happy. I tried the rice it was very flavorful.

My friend loved the pho and I thoroughly enjoyed the vegan pho.

Here's the problem, so we ordered dessert. It too a really really long time. So long that other waiters kept looking at us like, why are these people still here. Basically we felt like they wanted us to leave and we were using up the space. Terrible feeling, at one point I was like should we just leave. They made the wrong dessert, and took the cake off the bill. Which was really nice. Someone should have a least told the staff we weren't just chilling there we were actually waiting for food, because we felt for uncomfortable.

The food was great, but service can be better.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Mediocre pho. It would be a cute brunch place, but definitely is not a place you would go for Vietnamese pho if that's what you're looking for. Pho was portioned in a shallow bowl with little soup - which the whole point of pho... Taro chips are dry - but that may be the nature of taro in general. Maybe come here if you're looking for typical brunch foods, but not for the ""Vietnamese bistro"" it claims to be.

The atmosphere of the place is cute with hanging upside-down plants and a large mirror on the left. The vibes were chill, but I value the taste of my food and this just wasn't the place for that.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"The only reason this place has so many reviews is because they offer free desert if you write them a review on the spot. I'm sure people were pressured to write good reviews because you have to show it the waitstaff.

The food there actually was not very good and portions were not that generous given the price you are paying.

I definitely felt cheated a little bit picking this place. Sorry yelpers this one is smoke and mirror.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"This place is super racist or service is just shitty for no reason. Maybe they have high ratings because they offer free dessert for reviews?? Idk but this ain't it.

I walk in WITH a reservation for 3 and ask for a table.

Then he points to the one table of black women who are already done eating and asks if I'm with them.   Is that a joke?

Anyways ends up sending me to a table that's wrapping up.  10 min later another waiter tells me to get up so he can seat some close friends of his whose full party was not present.

Pho was lukewarm, bao was good. My friend had to ask for a beer 3 times before the waiter finally ""remembered."" There is better service and better Vietnamese food literally everywhere else in NYC",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"BoCaphe is a busy restaurant and brunch destination that attempts to tie Vietnamese cuisine to its French roots.  

Around 1:30pm on a Sunday was about the time when peak rush hour started to dissipate.  My girlfriend and I were able to quickly get seated as soon as we arrived, but the restaurant was still full and customers were still coming in.  It was very crowded and the tables were small (so do the heavy shopping afterwards).

I ordered the Bao Beef Burger, medium-well, with Shiitake & Truffle Sauce ($17 + $3) and my girlfriend ordered the Chicken Pho with Dumplings ($16 + $4).  The burger came with taro fries, which was a pleasant change to regular fries.  The burger did not disappoint, at all.  Every bite was juicy, especially with the added sauce.  My girlfriend enjoyed the pho and was able to finish the bowl.

BoCaphe,"What a refreshing twist to the traditional Vietnamese food.
We ordered:
- shrimp summer roll: super fresh, loaded with greens & the peanut sauce tasted freshly made
- chicken & ginger rice noodle bowl: personally I prefer the traditional rice noodle bowl you'd get from a regular Vietnamese restaurant, but it was still very tasty, very refreshing, and loaded with greens as well
- chicken papaya salat: this dish was very similar to the rice bowl, its as if the rice noodles were substituted with green papaya ""noodles"" nonetheless, it tasted really good

Highly recommend this place for people who love their greens and vegetables, it's a perfect place for those who are vegetarian, vegan or plant based, however it comes with meat choices for those who prefer meat, a great balance.

Definitely come back and try other items!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

For the cost of the cocktails, the quality definitely needs improvement! the place is also full of tourist so go early, it'll be elbow-to-elbow kind of seating if you don't mind rubbing elbows!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

I got the ginger soy chicken option of the noodle dish with zoodles instead and my friend got the rainbow salad and we were both very pleased with the taste and quality of our meals. Only downside to the experience was the layout of the restaurant and the price. We made a reservation on yelp and we still didn't get a table, we were placed at bar seats, and we were constantly hit by people walking by. Food service was quick and the waitress was friendly despite being obviously flustered with all that she was doing. I paid too for my lunch and got no drinks or sides and it was not a ton of food, so for me BoCaphe is more of a place to go for a treat, I would not go there very often.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Ventured here for breakfast because I was craving something other than the run-of-the-mill breakfast options and was mildly hungover and wanted warm soup. Our party was the first and only one there for a good 1.5 hours, which is understandable considering most people don't want pho or rice first thing in the morning. Needless to say, it was awesome to have the whole place to ourselves. We received great service and got to enjoy the fun decor and space.

The food was good -- but I wouldn't say amazing. Price points were understandably a bit high, but I feel like the meals didn't deserve the prices. Our broth for our pho was rich and flavorful, but the slices of beef were skimpy. I also wished our soup was hotter -- it was warm but not hot. Their Vietnamese coffee is fantastic and comes in your own personal drip -- however, i would also recommend them heat the water very hot because by the time it drips (it takes a good bit), the water has substantially cooled off.

BoCaphe,Don't go here if you're looking for good pho! I had the Vermicelli bowl with beef which was good and my friend had the classic pho. The drinks were good too.

BoCaphe,"I'm surprised this place has such good reviews - this was one of the times that I felt really let down by yelp reviews, cause they are fairly accurate in New York.

We might as well have gone to a fast-casual place for a bowl for half the price. I ordered the lemongrass beef rice bowl, and my mother ordered the truffle beef with shiitake mushroom bowl. We also had the beef bao. Each of these dishes tasted exactly the same - like store-bought teriyaki beef. It was so disappointing and extremely expensive for what it was.

My husband got the shrimp curry which was also very bland.

The noise level is NOT average, it is VERY loud. Take your money elsewhere.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

BoCaphe,"I've been here a couple times. My overall verdict is that the best part of BoCaphe is its atmosphere. The food is a sort of ""healthier"" version of some Vietnamese classics, but I found that means the dishes are often less flavorful and less satisfying. The service is usually a bit erratic. Still, it's a really lovely space in a nice location. If you don't want to wait for Jacks' Wife Freida or you don't want to pay a ton for a meal, this place will do.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"Ordered Vietnamese ice coffee, taro fries, beef truffle rice bowl, egg Benedict.

With Vietnamese coffee- it's a drip onto condensed milk and then stirred into ice. The way they served it made the drink watered down and hands down worst coffee ever.

Taro fries was good.

Egg Benedict- we only got it because Asian style Benedict, why not!? Did not impress us.

Rice bowl was good. I love the sautéed veggies. I prefer my rice places with fish sauce and they use the peanut dip. It was pretty good though.

Definitely not impressive enough to come back.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"5 stars for service, 4 stars for food. I tried the Classic Pho and it was amazing, but there was nothing special about it that I would pay $6-7 more than the usual pho price in Manhattan. The amount was also pretty small. I also tried the Bao burger (it comes with taro fries!) - it's good for a unique experience but I think it's not something I would come back for. The big positives were the service and the overall vibe of the restaurant.

BoCaphe,The pho was very mediocre and flavorless--also extremely overpriced. The taro fries were ok but are not worth trying.

BoCaphe,"3.5 stars. It's a fun and hip restaurant. We went on a Saturday early afternoon for brunch and the place was nearly packed. It's fairly loud and music playing. Lots of plants. It's a great place to go with a group.

I'm a huge fan of long benches at a restaurant - it feels more inclusive. We sat down at the end of the bench and started off with Vietnamese coffee, taro fries and a spring roll. Coffee is good and sweet, taro fries are exactly like the one at baohaus but it's thick cut. Spicy mayo that comes with it is a good pair. The spring roll was disappointing - it had quinoa in it and only came with one spring roll that was cut in half. $5 for one small spring roll. Wouldn't get again.

We got the cauliflower rice bowl with truffle beef and we got the veggie and tofu noodle bowl. The cauliflower rice bowl was the winner of our meal. Seasoned well and enough protein (though the beef was tough). The noodle bowl had little to no taste to it. We couldn't get through a few bites into the dish.

Bocaphe is a casual fun restaurant to go to but I wouldn't consider it authentic Vietnamese and it definitely isn't cheap.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"My bowl of pho was $18.75. yes really. For rice and noodles.

No one came over so I went up to the bar, grabbed a menu, ordered and then found water.

Meat was so tough and chewy I used my hands to rip it. No flavor.

Apparently i was at JFK. Mediocre food for astronomical prices.

If you love pho as much as I do and look forward to that bowl all day, skip this place, please.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"I'm surprised this place have such great reviews. It's not bad but not a place I'd come again. The interior decorations and vibe is decent, it's cute and modern. Love the lights and plants. The service was good, staffs were friendly and attentive. The wait wasn't long and I can see why..the food was really just okay. Wasn't bad at all and it's fairly light on the stomach but it didn't amaze me. Even with regular and cheaper pho places, I've had better. It's nice but not as flavourful as it should be and don't get me started on the portion. Most places in North America or Asia that service pho usually have double the amount and some places don't have double, but at least half more of what was there. I was barely full. The mung bean sprouts were really old and you can really tell by the colour..it's not fresh. If you check in and write them a review you get free dessert so maybe that's why there's so many good reviews? The wifi is bocapheguest and the password is ilovepho. The price isn't that bad but for its portion and taste it's a bit on the high side and not as worth it. Not a place I'd warn people not to come but not a place it'd recommend either. I don't think I'd go back either. Some staff there speaks French too but all of them speaks English.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,After spending about an hour checking out brunch places that have very lengthy wait times in soho and little italy stumbled on bocaphe.. really quaint place and looks very small but decent for nyc. We had their original breakfast plate. It was actually a suggestion from the waiter. Its a bit of french and Vietnamese mix cuisine. The tables are really small and compact. If you dont mind that you are all set. We also had the pancakes. They were all right.. can be better. Overall good place. Worth checking out.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"OK, Vietnamese food with several vegan options clearly marked.

I gave them a three because the vegan pho tasted super basic and boring. I think they used way too much star anise since it seemed to overpower the soup. The noodles were thin (not the thick variety) and seemed slightly overcooked. The veggies were delicious though.

I did enjoy the charcoal mimosa, though, it seemed like a perfect drink for a goth or Halloween.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"I don't know why this place has such good reviews.. Sad to say that the pho isn't authentic at all and it just has a flashy atmosphere that makes it appealing on the outside. The pho broth had little taste and the toppings were meager, and we had to hunt down the server multiple times to get a water refill. It seemed hugely understaffed and definitely wasn't worth it for me. I will say that the taro fries appetizer was unique and tasty, but that's about it.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

I really enjoyed the floating plants hanging upside down all through out the restaurant. I was sitting at the bar with my mom and I loved how the main lighting was of a colorful string with a color bulb at the bottom dangling from the ceiling. The chicken salad was delicious, I really enjoyed how everything tasted flavorful and complimented each other. I would definitely return to try out other dishes.

Starting with the good:
Taro fries: Came with spicy mayo sauce on the side, was a decent portion.

Chicken satay bao bun: Favorite dish here. But not sure if one bite is worth 7$.

Entrees:
Mama tom: Curry is bland and there was only three pieces of small shrimp.

Black pepper beef vermicelli noodle: Good flavor, but in the end, just too salty.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

We tried the veggie bo bun and classic pho.

The veggie bo bun had lots of fresh veggies, very satisfying

BoCaphe,"BoCaphe was very disappointing delivery food for the price point. Skirt steak was missing the fingerling potatoes that were advertised with no communication as to the reason or price adjustment to accommodate it. The chimichurri tasted like salty limp lettuce, with none of the flavors that customarily come in chimichurri. Meat on both orders were limp with no sear to it. Vermicelli bowl was seriously lacking in vermicelli and was more like salad with a few noodle tossed in. Don't even get me started on the shrimp summer roll. Sorry I didn't bother to check the quantity before ordering but for 8 dollars I expect to see two summers rolls at a minimum, not one summer roll cut in half with a casing that has hardened a little past it's prime. Even the peanut sauce was runny, no idea how they messed up that one because you actually have to try hard to make peanut sauce runny. Overall edible, but not fresh, and not even close to authentic. 1 extra point for being 'healthy' I guess. For Vietnamese it's a hard pass for this spot. Not sure where the good reviews came from at all.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night and ordered a bowl of chicken pho and a beef rice bowl. We thought the food wouldn't be complicated to make but one hour after ordering we were still waiting. The table who ordered after us had already been served as well, which included the exact orders that we had included in their dishes.

After the dishes finally arrived, we realized that the pho noodles were hard - it was completely undercooked. We were so hungry at that point that we just ended up drinking the pho soup and eating the not so seasoned beef bowl. I think the place can be really good during non busy periods based on the other yelp reviews, but don't come when it's super busy...it will save you the disappointment.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

I really liked the green papaya chicken salad.  It was seasoned just right and may have been the best green papaya chicken salad that I have had.  It was really refreshing to eat.  And the spring rolls were great as well.  The food here is very fresh and crisp and healthy with lots of veggies and good to bookmark when you are looking for a nice Vietnamese restaurant.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

I especially love that they have the option to switch regular noodles out for zucchini noodles or rice out for cauliflower rice. For this girl on keto, being able to have pho again (which is really all about the broth) was awesome!

Their cocktails all sound fun and are super pretty too - I'll have to check out dessert next time on a cheat day!

They have a really good breakfast menu, but their pho is also good. Pricy for the portions provided. Ambiance is great. If you make a Yelp review, you get a free dessert! We got the Cocoa Chia and the Chocolate Mousse. Delicious Cocoa Chia!

The decoration and the environment add the cozy and warm feeling on top of the beautiful street view. It is very good for date night, family night, or even going and enjoy the food by yourself, so it's 5 stars. I really like the service here, everyone was nice and friendly.

BoCaphe,"This restaurant probably have 5 star review from people who are desperate for free dessert as they give out free dessert for yelp check in ‍

Positive yelp reviews can be deceiving; People probably eat there for the ""instagram pic""

When we walk in, the hostess was on her phone by the bar and didnt acknowledge us. The tables were small and if the restaurant were busier, people would be shoulder to shoulder. They gave us water and a bottle with whole strand of mint leaf/plant, the water look foggy and tastes like flower vase's water (yuck! nasty!) We ordered Pho and it took them 35 minutes to bring it out (?!) The Pho tasted like one of those generic quick and easy pho soup base you can get in asian grocery store. Nothing about it was special, the meat was thick and small, the herbs were wilted, not fresh, and looked like they were picked from someone's left over. One top of that a bowl of Pho cost $17 there, WHAT IN THE FRESH HELL??

Because the Pho took 35 minutes to cook, and the water was nasty, we decided to order Vietnamese coffee, we were naive and thinking that ""you cant really mess up coffee,"" WE WERE WRONG, the coffee filter hardly have any coffee ground in it, and the coffee dripped too fast because of it which lead to tasteless coffee. The coffee filter was placed on top of an iced cup, and when hot coffee touches the cup, the ice melt, which lead to the coffee tasting even more bland at this point.

The service was horrible, the server didn't pay attention to us, THERE WERE LITERALLY NOBODY THERE (probably because everything sucks and overpriced) It was so difficult to get a hold of them

For the love of god, please dont sit close to the front because the noise from the subway probably would kill your eardrum

When youre tryna be cool and hip so you typed ""Phò"" instead of ""Ph"" for your menu.

I've even tried the ones in Ctown on that vietnamese street and they weren't that good either. So, I was a bit skeptical to try this place and I was sort of proved right again..

The service is excellent and the decor is cute. It's a small narrow restaurant. My only favorite part was the drinks. They are served on these really cute glasses depending on what you order. We got chicken phos, bowl and some bao buns. Pho took 2 seconds to come out. We understand that the broth is pre-made and they just drop in noodles, but even so, the noodles didn't have enough time to soak the broth flavors so it was just blend. Literally just noodles in broth, nothing more than that. The bowl was actually the better one out of everything. The bao buns which they were charging about $5-7 each were tiny tiny. The mushroom bao was so tiny. The miso eggplant one I got had maybe 1 eggplant that was 2 inches long and had weird hummus smell which was supposed to be miso.. i couldn't eat it.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

It's the natural choice if you're not trying to wait in line for Jack's Wife Freda. The atmosphere feels young and casual. The decor easily attracts millennials like myself. I wasn't too jazzed about the food / selection. I ordered the Vietnamese coffee; I've only tried hot Viet coffee once, and if you ever have, it's served in a fancy way where you watch the coffee drip drip and then mix the condensed milk yourself. $6 for a small cup = way overpriced..

Restaurant is narrow, but has a fun casual vibe. We shared the Chicken & Ginger Vermicelli Noodle Bowl and the Beef & Lemongrass Rice Bowl. Both were really good, we enjoyed them very much. Only complaint is the BF ordered an iced tea which tasted really watered down for a $7 beverage.

Great place for fresh, healthy Vietnamese eats. Looking forward to coming back!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"My first time was a delight! Great vibes and exciting menu- came in for Sunday brunch with the best company.
Coming back just for the taro fries. Spring rolls are incredibly crispy and flavorful. Make sure you don't over look their juice menu!
Their Bo sunny juice was incredible!
Jeremy, one of our servers, was so sweet!

I will be back",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"The food here is as bland as the clientele. Don't be fooled by the instagrammers that flock here and take staged photos as that's all this place seems to be good at. There's either a shortage of salt in the kitchen or the chef is no longer tasting. The tofu and veggie bahn mi was one of the worst Bahn Mis I've ever had. It was bland and the pickled radishes we're soggy and flavorless. If you're craving Vietnamese food I recommend walking a few blocks to Mooncake Foods where the service is faster, the food is tastier, and the prices are reasonable.

The best thing in this meal were the taro chips--the same unlimited ones you get on JetBlue flights for free! Needless to say I will not be coming back and had to suppress the inner urge to warn those passing by to keep walking.

To add to the bad experience they were cash only but neglected to tell us their machine was down until the end of the meal.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"There are few restaurants in SoHo worthwhile to visit.  BoCaPhe isn't one of them but circumstances hijacked the choice of neighborhood one day, and it offers a brunch respite.

Walking in past a few outdoor cafe tables, the narrow restaurant seems to extend far toward the back, and appeared larger than it is courtesy of a wall of mirrors along one side.  The decor is attractive, affecting a cluttered, artsy home.  The cramped seating fits right in, and isn't odd for Manhattan restaurants, but most of the seats far from the aisle will take some flexibility to get to and from.

The food is touted as Vietnamese ""with a French twist.""  A puzzling thing to say, when Vietnamese food already has ""a French twist"" from its time under French colonization.  And it is just as much, if not more, influenced by Chinese cuisine, which doesn't get a nod, presumably because it wouldn't sound tres chic.

In any case, one would be hard put to see the French twist in the menu, which reads more like well-known Vietnamese dishes (pho, bún, cha giò, goi cuon) with international twists, including teriyaki, miso, quinoa, and chimichurri.  The options are diverse enough for most, the food is not too exotic for the less adventurous, and notably has many vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.

The beef pho (pho bò) arrives in a bowl nestled within a large plate, on which sits a few classic southern garnishes (bean sprouts, limes) and American substitutes (sliced jalapeños, basil).  The portion is extraordinarily small for the price, and even harder to justify from the quality, if compared to most any other place serving pho in New York.  The broth is insipid and the beef almost decorative and without variety.  The beef bún bo is better, helped by good garnishes, but the beef bordered on tough and the cha giò had chewy skin and an uninspired filling.

Despite the restaurant name (""Coffee Pot""), the Vietnamese coffee was weak, with off-flavors.  At least it is presented with a steel single cup filter, dripping into the serving cup, a common way it is made in Vietnam.

Clearly, BoCaPhe isn't for me.  Besides the issues with quality and value, there's an affectation here about what they are that is unnecessary and untrue.  Those less familiar or particular about Vietnamese cuisine may find it reasonably good, and especially those who enjoy or want vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-free foods with Vietnamese influence.

On a different note, the restaurant's website story has entertainment value, hopefully unintentional.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,"I would definitely try the shrimp vermicelli bowl. The shrimp had a lot of flavor and the sauce for the noodles was the perfect balance of tangy and umami. 5 stars for my dish alone.

Unfortunately my partner got the bao burger and didn't like it. Also service was really slow but it was really busy so I understand. I love that this place is reasonably priced. We'd come back for the vermicelli bowls for sure",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

BoCaphe,"BoCaphe is a cute place that you can pop into with a small group of friends for brunch/lunch. However I will say that it is quite expensive compared with more traditional Vietnamese restaurants that I grew up accustomed to. I ordered the vermicelli noodles with beef/lemongrass and while it alleviated my hunger, it didn't quite satisfy my craving that I had for something that reminded me of Mom's cooking. The produce that is typically found in Vietnamese cuisine was fresh and the flavors of the nuoc mam were on point but the noodles were a bit undercooked.

It's quite pricey on its own, plus delivery adds even more. I paid $31 ($3 extra for zucchini noodles) and received a PINCH of noodles. Anyone who knows good pho knows that noodles make the soup what it is. I couldn't believe how much I was ripped off tonight. I tried to call the restaurant but they do not answer their phones. Seamless only returned the $3 when it should have been more. Never have I paid THIRTY DOLLARS to receive a couple strips of chicken and clear soup.

Juices are excellent here. Bo sunny comes highly recommended. Fresh coconut is fresh, sweet, and full of tender meat.
Fried spring Rolls  are nice although mine was burnt at one little area and did not get ginger in the ginger and chicken roll.
Beef and lemongrass rice bowl- never got any lemongrass :/
Taro fries are nice.

Summer roll was nicely done. Very refreshing.

BoCaphe,"I'm from California, in an area with a huge Vietnamese population and you could toss a rock in any direction and you'd probably hit the doorstep of a pho restaurant. This was probably the most average pho I've had. The broth was whatever, and they didn't have a lot of the extra fixing (dried chili flakes in oil, sriracha, hoisin) readily available, but that might have been because it was late at night. The meat was very tender and delicious though, to their credit. The service was very quick too. It's also the most expensive bowls of pho I've ever had. Ended up being almost $50 for two bowls after the tip... normally used to paying around 20-25 after tip.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

BoCaphe,"How does this place have 4 stars with close to 1k reviews? I do not get it. I really don't.

My boyfriend and I were hungry and wanted to grab dinner. This was the closest thing nearby on yelp that had good reviews (once again, HOW!?!). We walked in and the place was empty. We locked eyes with one of the employees and told him we wanted a table for two. He looked at us and walked away. This also happened to the next few parties behind us. He walked up to them.. asked them if they needed help.. they told him they wanted a table and he legit just WALKS AWAY. He didn't say anything like oh i'll get a host for you in a second or anything just.. walks away...slowly backs up.. into the back of the restaurant.. okay weird.. but ok..

5 minutes later... the one waiter they have.. YES ONE! seats us. He then walks away without giving us menus.. a few minutes go by and i'm so hungry i just go up to get my own menu. The tables are so small and the place is so compact. There is literally no room to do anything. The couple who sat next to us was PDA to the max when we were literally 2 inches from each other which was so uncomfortable.

The prices here are so ridiculous. 16 dollars for a bowl of pho? Are you kidding? I literally wanted to walk out but was hungry so decided to stay. We ordered the classic pho and the beef lemongrass vermicelli noodles bowl. The food took forever and a half to get to us. Someone who ordered after us got their food first. We still witnessed awkward interactions between the waiter and employees to customers.... I think they need customer service training classes.

We got our food and the portions are small. It was such a joke I literally laughed. Did I come here for dinner or did i come here for a snack? I wasn't even sure at that point. The broth was bland and meh. My boyfriend finished the pho in legit two bites because there was literally nothing in there. The beef slices are thick and disgusting. My vermicelli bowl was ALLLLLL vegetables/lettuce.
On top of that, my boyfriend's spoon reeked of bleach. Straight up bleach. He asked for another spoon and the same thing.. BLEACH.

I don't even know if i'm more mad at myself that I paid a premium for horrible viet food or that i'm more mad at the restaurant for serving horrible viet food.

0/10 would not recommend this place to anyone. I should've stuck to my gut and left when I got a bad vibe/feeling the minute I entered. The worst part is chinatown is the next neighborhood over. The 4 stars on yelp is SO deceiving.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

BoCaphe,"Food: 3.5
Service: 4
Ambiance: 4
Value: 3
Overall: 3.5

BoCaphe is a darling - not a food critics darling, but more of an instagrammer/celeb in town/fashionable girls darling.

The food was fine. Probably one of the better places for vietnamese fare in the Soho area. It's fusion - kinda (is that why everything is a lil more expensive than I think it should be?). More like a trendy restaurant with Vietnamese food (summer rolls, bo bun, pho), as well as a few interesting things thrown in especially for the health-trend conscious.

The Chick'Ginger Crispy Spring Roll (3.5/5) was crispy but a bit dry and needed more seasoning, I ended up hogging the dipping sauce. I love taro, but the taro fries (3.5/5) - which could've been great! - were just okay. They would be improved if they were thinner. Classic Pho (4/5) and chicken pho (3.5/5) were both pretty good. The broths were fairly light. I'd recommend the beef over the chicken, which was much more tender. The chicken pho was more like a healthy chicken noodle soup - it still hit the spot on a chilly day.

(side note: the girl next to me ordered avocado toast and it looked pretty sad, this is not the place to order it)

The interior is cute, casual, and colorful. Space is tight - you'll likely have to do a little wiggle to get to your table. But they at least provide coat stands for your bulkier items. Service is fast-casual style. Before you leave, drink a honey lemon ginger shot to fortify yourself against the cold outside - it's surprisingly tasty.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bocaph%C3%AA-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
BoCaphe,Solid Vietnamese food!! My one gripe is that it's pretty pricey for Vietnamese food when compared to the food in Chinatown only 10 minutes away -- but I guess that's to be expected from their Soho location. The food itself was flavorful and felt very light and healthy compared to other Vietnamese dishes I have had in the past.

I ordered an Açaí bowl, because I wanted something fresh but not too sweet. However, instead of chia seeds they put a ton of syrup on top, which was not indicated on the menu and really ruined it for me. I was barely able to finish it even though it was only a small portion. A little too small for the price of it actually. My friend's rice bowl seemed to be fine though.

Katz's Delicatessen,"Don't ask for Mayo!

After all these years, my familiar sandwich maker guy is long gone, but the pastrami is still the best. There is other stuff on the menu like the knishes and hot dogs but When I'm here, I'm here for the pastrami.

There was a time when I could polish off a pastrami sandwich comfortably but those days are long gone.  My best way to eat a Katz pastrami sandwich these days is to get a piece whole to take home to slice up and make sandwiches on my own.  It doesn't take away any from the taste of the pastrami when you take it home and you can be as messy as you want when nobody is looking.  If you do get your sandwiches made by these experts, the pastrami slices are thick cut and juicy which makes a difference in my opinion.

A few tips to know before your first visit, they have these archaic rules regarding the ordering ticket that you are given when you walk in.  You'll need that to order food with that ticket so don't lose it.  You'll have to hand that ticket back if you don't use it so don't take it if you don't need it.  They also have separate lines for each server/section which makes it a hassle if you need to wait on separate lines for hot dogs or knishes or fries.  Those tip jars in front aren't for show, make sure you tip when your server is looking for the best quality/service.  You will also be judged if you ask for Mayo so just don't!

Finally it is no doubt a pricey sandwich and it's also a bit out of the way to get to.  But do make the trip because there aren't too many institutions like Katz's around anymore and this one is definitely worthy it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Mind blowing best corned beef sandwich. After the stay home order from COVID-19, I missed my spots that I occassionally visited in weekly basis. I had a day off and decided to drive Manhattan picking up their pastrami.
Embracing the new normal, There was a line to keep the social distance and took few minutes to enter the place; the death toll was quite high at that day. The employee still gave you a sample of your order, and I put the chunk of meat underneath of my facial mask. Paid and quickly drove back to Jersey. (20 mins ride due to no traffic)
The food was still warm, and the pastrami was full of juice and blended with dijon mustard on the rye. I hope I can visit again and seated in the near future. Thank for reading my review and stay safe.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Delicious!! Amazing pastrami! Got the half matzoh ball soup and half lean pastrami sandwich. The soup had one large matzoh ball in a pint sized container with carrots and celery in it. Decent soup with the sandwich. Different than some other chicken based matzoh ball soups I've had though, which was yellowish broth vs this brownish broth.

The pastrami is the star. Extremely delicious and moist, even the lean pastrami when it's hot. It's dry a little bit when it cools, but still very good. Great option if you're trying to avoid dripping oozing oiliness. It's not as dry as chicken breast meats. The tomato and heaping lettuce gives the pastrami a good balance of meat and some veggies.

The broccoli knish was good. Great side to the pastrami sandwich. I prefer the round knish over the square potato knish. The potato knish taste like most potato knishes.

Portions are huge. Shareable or save some for later.

Glad this place delivers. It's on delivery.com and can be scheduled. They do have a minimum but it's easy to reach with a combo of 1-2 pounds of meat, couple sandwiches, some knishes. Best part is not waiting to wait in line for this amazing food and helping small business at this time.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"What can I say?  The NYC icon is worth every dollar of the $20 per sandwich.  The atmosphere alone is just incredible. The Harry met Sally story is pretty awesome too.

You'll enjoy this place!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz's doesn't need another complementary review but it is that good. Their meats are simply exceptional and their portions are unrivaled. Their prices are moderate by NYC standards, especially considering the portions you get with each sandwich. Going to Katz's is a fun experience. You stand anxiously waiting for your meal and are forced to watch your butcher meticulously carve your meat. You are given just a small piece that will surely give you an appetite if you didn't already have one. If you are looking for an incredibly unique NYC experience, going to Katz's is a must!

Rueben (5/5): Their famous Rueben is exactly what you could ask for. Fresh rye bread with huge pieces of perfectly cured pastrami, mounds of cheese, and plenty of sauerkraut. They give you so much pastrami it will surely not fit within the sandwich, which is a problem I don't mind having when the meat is this good.

Corn beef (5/5): Their corn beef, though not as popular as the pastrami and brisket, is also delicious. They marble the fat perfectly so that every piece is unusually tender. It is easy for corn beef to have a tough texture, but not one piece we had was anything other than juicy and tender!

Latkes (5/5): Their latkes are thick and very doughy. They have a perfect char to them. If you have never had one, it is basically an exceptional hash brown. These are a great compliment to any sandwich or meat option. A single order is enough for a couple to split easily!

Going to Katz's is not an overrated experience, NYC is filled with those. Their unique and storied location and great food makes this an indulgence anyone can enjoy!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Okay where do I even start. I know that you really didn't visit New York if you didn't stop here. I am not sure if it was extra busy because I went during Christmas, but man that place was PACKED! The line to get in was like a mile long.

They hand you a ticket before you even step inside. DO NOT LOSE THAT TICKET! You will need it to exit the building, otherwise you have to pay the minimum fee.

Once you get in, good luck finding a line. There is a few of them, but it's honestly one massive crazy mess of people. You can choose to take the food to go, take the food to a seat yourself area, or sit down, dine in and have a server. The first time I got the food to go. I waited about 45 min outside, and another 30 min inside. They carve the meat right in front of you and give you a sample as you wait. So dang good. I got the pastrami sandwich. It is REALLY expensive. But it is worth it, really huge portions and the best pastrami you will ever have. Their pickles are also super amazing. It cuts the richness of the sandwich just right.

I chose to dine in the second time, still took just as long but it was nice to be able to sit down and enjoy the food.

We got the brisket and pastrami sandwiches and a matzo ball soup. The brisket sandwich was pretty moist and delicious but the pastrami sandwich I think was the favorite. It was extremely flavorful and was miles better than any other pastrami I have had. I also thought it was kind of cool that they just give you a TON of pickles with the sandwiches. The matzo ball soup was just alright with me, good chicken broth and the matzo ball tasted fine.

During this time they are pretty busy so they forgot some of my toppings on the sandwich, but other than that my experience with the takeout was generally positive and I would definitely order from here again.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This was a restaurant that was highly recommended to me when I came to New York a while ago. Since New York is known pretty well for their delis within the US, we wanted to go to one of the most well-known delis to check it out. The interior is decently sized, although it was pretty packed when we went and we had to wait a while. You could tell that there was a lot of media coverage for the place, since even while we were there we saw a news channel getting footage of the restaurant. The place is quite pricey for a sandwich, with one sandwich costing $23 so it's not something many people can afford to go to everyday.

   My friends and I got the signature Katz's pastrami sandwich, and although I don't have pastrami often I have to say that this is the best that I've had so far! The pastrami meat is super juicy and melts on your tongue, with every bite being really flavorful. The mustard and other sauces they add also complement the meat well to enhance the taste. Each sandwich comes pretty stuffed with pastrami, so you don't have to worry about them skimping out on it.

   Overall, I would recommend checking this place out at least once if you're ever in New York for the experience of a top-tier deli! It's pretty pricey to come regularly, but it's definitely well-known for a good reason!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Three words: corned beef hash. This is by far the best I've ever had. The meat is so tender.. and you have to order it ""Reuben style"". They do not skimp on the meat .. at all! I can usually only finish 1/2.

So let me back up and talk about the experience. When you walk in, it is pure chaos - people everywhere, restaurant employees yelling at you to keep moving lol but they have a good system. They have multiple lines and you pick whichever one you want .. shortest obviously. But have a general idea of what you want too - they like to keep things moving. If you want to sample the meat they will gladly slice a piece and pass to you on a saucer while they prep your food. Then you get a ticket and head off to find a seat while you wait for sides you may have ordered, like French fries.

Before you head to the exit you pay at the back of the restaurant and keep your receipt as they will not let you exit until it has been checked.

This is a must try on every visit to NY, I have even ordered one to go to enjoy when I returned back home. It was good, but there is nothing like eating one of their sandwiches made fresh.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz's Deli was recommended by a relative of mine who was living in the city.  I tried it for the first time a few years ago.  On our NYC trip last summer, we made it a priority to stop here at this famous sandwich spot.  With over 12,000 Yelp reviews already, there's not much left to praise about Katz's.  

We arrived on a random weekday during lunch and expected a large crowd.  Once you enter, they give every customer a ticket.  Hang on to that ticket because they will ask for it when you exit.  If it's your first time here, it will seem chaotic.  But, its quite organized with multiple lines to place an order.  After that proceed to cashier.  Your number will be called when order is ready.  

The restaurant is large so don't worry about finding a table.  The customers are in and out really quickly.  Well, it's NY so everything is fast paced.  We were able to find a table for 3 during rush hour.  You may have to share a table with others since it's super crowded.  We liked that since it was nice chatting with the locals.  

The order was ready in about 15-20 minutes considering how packed it was at that time.  Of course we all ordered the infamous pastrami sandwiches.  The best sandwich you will ever have in the states!  The meat is so tender!  It is piled high on your choice of bread.  You have the option to add mustard or cheese.  

Katz's sets the bar above and beyond for other local delis.  They have been around for over 100 year so you know none can compare!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

I've ordered air-express from Katz's in NYC three times, each over $100 in pastrami and corned beef. It used to be a 5 star taste, now has fallen down this year to a 2 star taste, and 2 star in quality, and 0 stars in customer care.

Evidence presented to the court (of public opinion)

a) the pastrami came in thick worm like strips. Too thick (5mm) and too narrow (10mm to 15mm). Simply ridiculous. (see picture ""a"" attached below)

b) the meat was tough this year, compared to two previous order.

c) my written complaint to them regarding complaint A and B, didnt bother to ask any pictures or feedback, and simply replied: ""We apologize for your dissatisfaction with your  most recent order"". (see response ""c"" attached below)",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"What a place...I often dream of the pastrami.

Advice: look the menu up in advance if you're a first-timer so as to keep the pace going. I haven't been during quarantine times, but it's a fast-paced environment so be prepared. I had a friend from the south visit and boy was it a culture shock for her.

Direct, fast service for some of the best food in town. You won't be disappointed.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This is definitely one of the things that I never pass up when I have friends in town.  When Harry Met Sally was one of my favorite movies back in the day, and in addition to that famous diner scene, it was great to be able to get a solid iconic pastrami sandwich at this place.  I've recommended it to everyone who visits NYC, even if they aren't visiting me.  My go-to is the half-sandwich half-matso ball soup combo.  A full sandwich is way too much for me being that I'm not even a meat eater.  

I always recommend the sandwich DRESSED.  While the meat is juicy, it's just that extra flavor and moisture that comes with the dressing that takes it to the next level.

Pastrami Sandwich:
PROS:
- fantastic amount of meat: way more balancing in favor of meat
- generous with the dressing
- get a sample of the meat before you get the sandwich
- comes out freshly sliced and heated
CONS:
- not for vegetarians and not the most healthiest sandwich
- can tend to be slightly on the salty end

Matzo Ball Soup:
- full cereal bowl with one whole matzo ball!
- not overly salty
matzo ball is HUGE.
CONS:
none

Warning: do not lose the ticket that they give you! There is a hefty fine attached to that ticket.  Even if you place multiple orders on one ticket, you still have to keep the blank ticket.  I'd definitely recommend going on the off hour as the lines can sometimes go out the door and around the corner/down the block.  

Will always come back to Katz's.  Also a bonus: open late!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz is somewhat an institution in Manhattan.  Inside it resembles a dive restaurant.  You can watch the sandwich creators do their work on the spot and a lot of corned beef passes through this restaurant.  More importantly, the corned beef was very good.  It was piled high as I would have expected, but it also was just better than some other corned beef sandwiches I have tried.  It is worth a visit to eat the corned beef alone.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"The biggest pastrami sandwich I've ever seen! I could barely finish half with the amount of meat they pack on there. I would definitely share a sandwich unless you're a meat lover. I had the mustard and the dressing put on the side so I could spread them across my sandwich after taking off some of the pastrami. The pastrami was tasty but I felt it was a bit too much for me. Definitely come with an appetite as the pastrami is sliced thicker than 2nd Ave Deli's.

I also tried their latkes with apple sauce, potato salad, coleslaw, and pasta salad. Everything was pretty average but their coleslaw and pasta salad were good.

If you're gonna go all out and still have room, feel free to grab a black and white cookie.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"They shipped out their amazing food all the way to California! We got turkey, pastrami and corned beef along with lox.  They sent along pickles, Russian dressing, sour kraut and mustard. Bagels and rye bread also came.  Of course we added the most delicious potato knishes! For dessert we had chocolate babka and black and white cookies.  Everything came with great instructions for heating and serving! The first box UPS didn't deliver in time so it spoiled which was no fault of Katz. Katz gave us the option of refund or resend.  We picked resend and are so happy we did!  Missing NY deli then make a order here!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,We have ordered three packages from Katz's--amazing!  We ordered the Taste of NY and the birthday packages and they didn't disappoint. Rave reviews from family--and from an uncle who has missed it terribly since he has moved to OR. Thank you for a great product!  We will be returning online again for sure!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Since we are just outside of the local delivery range, we ordered food through Katz's nationwide shipping option, which worked out perfectly!  We requested the Lean Pastrami, Corned Beef, Matzo Ball Soup, Half-Sour Pickles, and Rye Bread.  The meats were both sous vide and only needed to be boiled for about 5 minutes before enjoying them in all of their juicy goodness.  The pastrami was as described and extremely lean.  The corned beef, on the other hand, was flavorful, but way too fatty for my liking.  Having to trim each piece down by almost half, due to the fat, really took any joy out of the meat. The soup was phenomenal!  The balls were flaky and not overly dense, and the broth had the perfect amounts of salt and dill.  The pickles were plump and crisp, and the bread was from Rockland Bakery, a favorite of mine that always produces high-quality baked goods.  The bread was doughy and soft, and remained as such for at least a week.  

Our Katz's delivery went so well that first time that we reordered again two weeks later, replacing the corned beef with Smoked Lox and adding a Noodle Kugel and a jar of mustard.  The pound of lox lasted for days and was some of the best smoked salmon I had ever had.  It had an enjoyable, cured flavor and was not overly fishy.  The Noodle Kugel was packed with fruits like mandarin oranges and pineapple, but remarkably did not come off as too sweet.  The mustard was zest, spicy, and worked just as well when used on my lox sandwich as it did on the pastrami.  The rest of the items were as delicious as they were on our initial order.  

Overall, while pricy, getting Katz's delivery was worth every penny and provided enough food for several meals.  It was so nice to experience a taste of NYC at home!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz's is a NY classic. There was a line outside when we arrived but it moves quickly.

Once you go in everyone in your party gets a ticket, and then you line up at the cutters to place your orders. Once you get to the front of the line you can tip the cutters there, and then they'll give you your food (whether it's for there or to go in a bag). Then you can either leave, or sit and eat, and then pay upon exit at the registers. Make sure everyone in your party holds onto their tickets - everyone has to turn one in when you leave. It's cash only if you pay on exit too, but if you need to use a card they redirected people to the counter with sides (kind of unclear though - so I'd just bring cash!).

We ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye (they'll add mustard or you can hold it and add it at the tables), and the matzah ball soup. It comes with pickles too so you don't have to order them separately. Their sandwiches are HUGE so you could probably get the half for one person, but if you're feeling ambitious splurge on the bigger one.

We sat and ate and then had leftovers, which you can bring up to the end counter and they'll wrap them up for you!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Coming from California, I've had a fair share of amazing eats. However, I was thoroughly impressed by both the simplicity and quality of the food here.

I shared a full pastrami sandwich and a matzo ball soup with my friend. The sandwich appears to be quite simple with two pieces of white bread, mustard, and pastrami. But...not only is it PACKED with pastrami, it was one of the most mouth-watering meats I've ever had. They even gave me pastrami samples as I waited for my sandwiches to be made. It was tender and flavorful and we devoured everything in less than 10 minutes. The matzo ball soup washed down the soup nicely and added a nice touch, but the sandwich is a must try. I can see why this place is highly reviewed and highly rated! Best food I had during my weekend NYC trip!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This place is definitely worth a try if you're new to NYC! I do not eat beef so my choices here were limited. My boyfriend and sister ordered the Pastrami Sandwich and Corned Beef Sandwich and they said it was okay. A 3/5. The portions are here and the prices are high so I believe it is worth it.. especially for something as popular as Katz. When we walked in, we decided to have table service which required waiting and getting called up when a table was open in a closed off section. The waiters were nice and helpful when ordering. Service overall was 5/5.

I had a turkey sandwich, french fries and chicken noodle soup. The sandwich was dry in my opinion.. but the soup and french fries were good. Nothing too memorable, but it was pretty good for a cold winter night!

I'd recommend this place to those who are fans of pastrami sandwiches. This is a very crowded, touristy area.

NOTE: When you first walk in.. they hand you a ticket that you must return when you leave the store. Not too sure why they have a system like this but it is interesting. Lost tickets have a fee of $50 I think so keep your ticket! Don't lose it!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Highly deserving of the ""When Harry Met Sally"" famous movie scene theatrics. This is a classic New York destination (probably more for tourists than locals) but it's very ""NYC"" in every way from the moment you walk inside.

Don't expect niceties or sugar coated service (unless you're Sally). Step up (or sit table side) and be ready to order. Don't try and substitute a bunch of stuff or get creative. And whatever you do make sure you order piping hot, delicious pastrami ""I'll have what she's having."" It's a MUST!

Aside from that, the pickles are incredible and ""included"" and the matzah ball soup and blintzes were pretty amazing as well. My daughter enjoyed the Turkey Reuben and I added in a salad (which the server kinda made fun of) but it was fresh and the Russian dressing so tasty with tiny chopped up pickles.

Delicious all the way around!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"My friend Lori L. has led me to many fine things.  She alerted me to Augie's Montreal Deli when it first opened, she told me about Boichik Bagels before they opened their brick and mortar store, and then she told me when she was going to order from Katz's for delivery.  I added a pound of tongue to her order, which arrived Wednesday.  If you order $100 worth, delivery is free.  Lori lives up the hill from me, so it's convenient for both of us.  She threw in a couple of bagels, one everything, one plain, and a couple of slices of rye bread.

I had a tongue sandwich for lunch today and it was fabulous, much better than the tongue from Zarri's, which is pickled.  I used part of the package and put the rest in the freezer for another sandwich or two in a few weeks.  Alan and I had the bagels yesterday, the everything for him and the plain for me.  Katz's doesn't make an onion bagel, just everything, plain and maybe poppy seed.  Lori tells me their everything bagels don't have caraway seeds on them, just onions, poppy seeds and sesame seeds.  Those I would eat, because it's the caraway seeds I object to.  So Alan and I will order a dozen bagels the next time Lori orders, maybe a loaf of rye bread, maybe some black & whites, which she mentioned and which I've never had.  Lori is definitely leading me off the path of righteousness, and it's delicious!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz is an iconic NYC deli shop that specializes in pastrami sandwiches with a classic American diner ambience. You start with getting an order number and then queue up in one of the 7 lines if you are ordering a sandwich or another separate line further down for other food items. It was about 5-10 minutes even though the queue is a chaos, but sometimes you could get unlucky and get stuck with someone in front ordering 100 sandwiches hypothetically. When it's your turn to order, you get to eat some pieces of meat as you wait for the person to prepare the sandwich for you, which is great. That also incentivizes people to tip.

The pastrami has a very good texture, slightly better than Wexler's in LA, but the prices seem to be quite high. You still do get a lot of meat, but I personally think that I enjoy just eating the pastrami in itself, savoring the flavor, than putting a large amount of pastrami in between two average, perhaps mediocre, slices of bread with a spread of mustard and some pickles on the side. That's just me, but I think that it's a great place to check out just once for the experience.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"My husband and I like to come here for their pastrami sandwich n matzo ball soup.. it's outstanding!! If it's your first time coming to this place in person you first have to get a ticket n tell them what you want, then give your ticket to the people behind the counter, and after you get your food you pay up front. It's all worth it!!! The pastrami meat is very rich in flavor n texture (perfectly made!). Definitely recommend coming here.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Fuck. Best pastrami ever.

Better than Canter's in LA. Better than Beigel Bake in London. (technically corned beef)

$22.95 for the pastrami sandwich feels like a deal. Make the pilgrimage here if possible.

Katz's Delicatessen,"The store is huge so finding a seat is not that difficult, though it can be busy. I came on a rainy Saturday morning, around 11 am. When you enter, there's a person by the door that gives you a ticket. DO NOT LOOSE THIS TICKET or it will cost you a whooping $50. It's your ticket to order food/receipt and ticket out the door. After you get your ticket, there are multiple lines to stand in and order, so just pick the shortest one. The guys behind the counter were very efficient and fast so it did not take long to order.

I ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye with melted cheese and mustard and it comes with a side of cucumbers and pickles. I thought it was weird but it complimented the sandwich so well! I am not a big fan of pastrami but boy, this sandwich easily changed my mind. The meat was so soft, juicy, and melts in your mouth. The bread was SO soft (it did not look good when I was looking at yelp photos)! This sandwich is huge, so it can be shared, and a good $26! Very expensive for a sandwich, but it is a quality sandwich!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"THANK YOU Anthony Bourdain... RIP.

A true deli, and a feel of New York. Once you enter, you'll receive an ordering ticket. This is how they will mark down what you ordered. DO NOT LOST THIS TICKET. *prepare yourself* it gets hectic inside, lines can be messy, be patient. You then line up in any of the carving stations to order. Be ready to order when it is your turn. They even give you samples if you wanted. You can eat there or take it togo. You pay at the register on the end with a credit card or cash at the door. They will check your receipt or charge you at the door before you leave.

I just received my first order from Katz's .
That The best idea I have ever had .The pastrami was superb , as were the pickles , Rye bread, bagels, knishes and black and whites . Everything was as good as i remembered it!
Their shipping is free if you order $100 of product , not hard to do! Everything is so good!
The delivery across country came on time as promised!

Katz's Delicatessen,"Amazing. Just really, really amazing.

Came here on a Friday night and surprisingly there was no line down the block. We were able to find seats right away and order quickly. My boyfriend and friend both got reubens with pastrami and I got a matzo ball soup and latkes. Their matzo ball soup was delicious and definitely the best I've ever had. HUGE matzo ball that was soft floating in a warm, flavorful broth. Their latkes were also ginormous and paired really well with the sour cream and applesauce. The sandwiches though were obviously the star of course. Like everything else here, the sandwiches were monstrous and stacked high with meat. The meat was like nothing I've had in a deli sandwich before. So tender and juicy and flavorful that I dream about it sometimes. The best hands down, nothing compares.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"I'm actually shook at this meat.... I'm telling y'all, I tried so many of the top hyped restaurants during this NYC trip and I straight up almost cried when we went to Katz. It was hands down my favorite from this entire trip. No wonder they ship their food nationwide...

My friend and I shared a matzo ball soup and pastrami hot sandwich combo, and I didn't care for the matzo ball soup but holy shit the pastrami was out of this world. I rarely feel THIS strongly about a food place but it was actual heaven biting into that super tender, juicy, flavor-packed pastrami. The sandwich looks so simple but Katz somehow makes it taste so damn delicious. I'm salivating as I write this review back in California. They also give you fat portions of samples when you're at the counter buying food.

The system is kind of weird because they make each person take a ticket as they walk in, and you're not allowed to lose it. But anyway, I can't wait to come back here the next time I'm in NYC.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This was my favorite meal I had on my recent trip to NY! It was really worth the hype. We ordered the pastrami sandwich on rye and we were far from disappointed. The meat was super tender and just melted in your mouth. I saved the rest for later on in the night and it tasted just as good cold. I'm drooling just thinking about it.

They're pretty efficient in how they run things with the crowds of people. You're given a ticket at the door and get in line to place your order. They stamp your ticket and you pay either in the front or the back if you're using a credit card.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This place is a MUST TRY if you have not been before! The infamous Katz's Deli (as seen on tv, movies, etc) lives up to its reputation and more! The sandwiches, the fries, pickles, etc...will leave you wanting more (or at least another to take home)!

It's in the city, so there is only street parking. Take the train, Uber or taxi here and you will not be disappointed at all. You get a ticket when you go in, order, eat, then pay on the way out. But do NOT lose your ticket...that is your exit ticket after you're finished eating and ready to check out.

Katz's Delicatessen,"Have to get crackin at these NYC reviews. All the boroughs...of NYC. Peter Luger's is in Brooklyn and so is Jay Z...nobody doubting that.

The famous. The Notorious. I had to come merely for the novelty of it. My parents lived in NYC first starting out and my family's been there since my grandparents, but no ones ever been to Katz's. First to review!

Prepare yourself for theme park lines. Only limited numbers for guests allowed inside, so lines out the door. Lines on the inside too. No ticket system here, just corral yourself as best as you can. Remember to save your ticket, cash only, all the protocols that come with this place. Could probably try late nights or early mornings to save on the line. I'm glad we found seats...this visit was 90% looking like a grab and go meal. Also take notice of food stations, drink stations. Squad ""A"" went for drinks while squad ""B"" went for food. Mission accomplished.

Pass on the corned beef. Yep. Kinda dry. Nothing compared to the pastrami. 4 stars just for the pastrami. It's an institution itself. The Reuben was delicious. Get it hot, melted cheese and house made dressing...worth it's weight in price. These are $20 sandwiches btw. Don't pass on the pickles. They're so fresh...and for someone who hasn't tasted more than just what you get at the grocery, they were worth it.

For a fan of that movie, worth it. A definite visit for a nyc food tour. If you can handle the lines, the busy-ness, the hustle and bustle, the City.

Katz's Delicatessen,"You have to visit at least once or twice if you're new to NY - it's an experience worth having. Legendary spot, friendly staff, pricey but the food is great and I mean... it's New York.

Tips for your visit:

The earlier in the day, the better. Around lunch, expect a crowd. Evening hours, expect to wait (think school cafeteria)

DO NOT LOSE YOUR TICKET - whether you're passing through or dining in, you're given a ticket as soon as you enter. You need that ticket for your order and it also serves as your exit pass. Lost tickets incur a fee upwards $50 (not even kidding, there's a sign on the podium).

Food Recommendations:

- Lox and cream cheese on bagel (everything bagel if you're serious, plain if you're shy)

- Knoblewurst + Rye bread

Katz's Delicatessen,"So much history and hype around this place but it just didn't do it for me. Stopped by here with my family on our Xmas trip to NYC one night around 7pm. The place was PACKED. It looks like there are a couple self service order stations for different items (food, sides, drinks) and also the option for sit down with waiter service. We opted to order ourselves and fight the masses to hop on the next empty table that would seat 5 since it's free for all table wise.

Onto the food, we ordered a couple pastrami, brisket and pastrami/brisket combo sandwiches with some fries of course. Sandwiches come with meat, slaw and Russian dressing (similar to Thousand Island). The meats were good but not mind-blowing. I liked the brisket a little more because it was more tender. I wish they could toast the sandwich bread but they don't do that here. I couldn't help but compare this deli to Langer's back home in LA, and Langer's takes the cake by miles in this comparison.

Maybe my expectations were too high coming into here",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Katz's Delicatessen,"My wife and I went to Katz's Delicatessen when we were in New York City this past February.

We arrived at about 11:30am and got in no problem. The restaurant was about a quarter full when we got there but steadily became more and more busy and was at least halfway full by the time we left.

We ordered the Pastrami Sandwich and a side of pickles to share. The sandwich is gigantic and can easily be shared by two people. The hand carved pastrami is smokey and juicy and practically melts in your mouth. The bitterness from the yellow mustard and acidity and crunch from the pickles complimented the sandwich perfectly. Who would have thought a sandwich as simple as pastrami and yellow mustard on rye with pickles on the side could be this good? The Pastrami Sandwich was unbelievable!

You can't go to NYC without going to Katz's Delicatessen - make sure to get the Pastrami Sandwich with pickles on the side. Highly recommended. Five stars.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Mmm the pastrami sandwich was soooo good! I was a little afraid that it'd be a tourist trap and I almost left cuz it was $23 for a sandwich. I'm glad I stayed tho and tried it!

(I think it's worth the money to try once considering the amount of meat on it but probs not something I'd do daily for a workday lunch.)

The meat was super tender and moist. Generous portion size (my sandwich pic was the smallest of the three slices!). The mustard was nice. They also give you a lot of pickles and cucumber on the side so you don't have to worry about it slipping out of the sandwich. The only thing that I can be picky about is the bread. Rye bread was just a little dry for me. But nothing a little mustard and pickle can't fix!!

The employee cut the sandwich up into 3 since he saw that we were sharing. I thought that was super nice. He also gave us some sample slices because we weren't sure what to order. Overall I'd say give this place a shot if you're nearby!

Note: To get in and out, you have to present this ticket you get at door. The employees at the deli counter marks your order on the ticket and then you pay at the end when you exit. The fee is $50 if you lose the ticket!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"If you are in Manhattan for any reason, for any ago out of time, you've got to go to Katz! This is an  absolute staple of the NYC food scene. You think you have had a sandwich, but just give yourself a real treat yo self gIft, and check it out!

I recommend giving yourself a good amount of time to get in, eat, and get out. You never know what the crowd will look like. Later in the evening, she slows down a wee bit. This particular time, we waited about 20 min before we got inside, not too shabby.

The inside can be overwhelming to the weak willed. You have to be cut throat, but if you're hanging out in NYC the lessons you learn in Katz will translate to the streets. Walk right up to the counter and order like you mean it. Know what you want ahead of time! They move quick quick quick and you will get lost in the shuffle if you're not confident and assertive. The same goes for finding a place to sit. I recommend dividing and conquering if you're in a group.

Now I will say I have only had the pastrami sandwich, but I will follow that with I will ONLY EVER have the Pastrami Sandwich. That sandwich is just so damn good. It's huge, so feel free to split it with a friend, or stranger, who cares. The pastrami  just melts in your mouth. You can tell they have spent thousands of hours perfecting that meat over many generations of sausage kings. I absolutely lose  my mind over that sandwich.

The place has a lot of history and deli kitsch all around, enjoy that. There's so many memories there from people big and small and that is so apparent when you walk in the door. I couldn't recommend this place more as a place to get a damn good meal and cross off the bucket list!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Delicious and hearty pastrami sandwich. My husband and I ordered a sandwich each but we could've definitely shared one sandwich and still feel full. They are hefty sandwiches STACKED with layers of meat.

The corned beef paled in comparison to the pastrami for me. But the pastrami sandwich with the dressing and their mustard on rye bread is a winner for me.

It's a little bit pricy but worth the try. It's a NYC landmark and dining experience that is a large part of experiencing the cultural landscape of the city!

That's a living legend, their pastrami on a rye sandwich was famous even before it featured a big screen movie When Harry Met Sally. After trying matzoh ball soup, bagels and the most important - pastrami, it becomes clear how did it survive after Great Depression, recessions and both world wars. For more than 130 years it has been serving the most beloved deli in NYC.

Being true tourist attraction, get ready for crowds and long lines there. At the entrance you will receive a ticket from a security guard, which believe me would be unlikely to argue with, so you'd better keep it safe unless you're ready to gift extra $50. Irrational system, but that how it works. I dare to assume their salary depends on the amount of lost tickets.

After such a long story they've definitely studied how should the sandwich and pickles taste like. Even though the portions are huge and you feel filled, it's overpriced. I'm sure here are the most expensive sandwiches in NYC. You are paying more for the experience and the experience itself worth it.
5 stars for the taste and ambiance, 3 stars for the long wait and the prices.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Could truly write a novel convincing you to stand in that dreadful line to experience the mouth-watering sandwich, but honestly, a picture's worth 1000 words, so I'll just leave a tl;dr:

Reviews on Katz's is always a mixed bag, but when it comes down to it, it's undeniably one of the best pastrami sandwiches you'll consume. The thiccccc stack of pastrami quite literally melts in your mouth with every bite. Would recommend keeping it simple and skip the cheese your first time in order to appreciate the pastrami on its own. However, would definitely keep adding that mustard to pull the whole thing together. Other highlights: the sample slices as you witness the creation of the heavenly heaps of meat, and the side of pickles to add some bite to the meal.

Yes, a hefty investment in both price and time, but a good ROI for it all.

Food: 5/5
Service/Speed: 5/5 (solid service)
Price (college student budget): $$
Ambiance: Casual & chaotic. Waited in the self-serve lines both visits.

Would return & recommend? 5/5",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"If you're looking for a classic Jewish deli, look no further. This was exactly what we were looking for in a NY deli.

There was a bit of a line outside when we got there for lunch on a weekend, but it moved fast. Everyone gets a ticket. Don't lose this ticket or you will get charged a lot of money because they won't know what you ordered.

Process: make your way through the mob of people to order. Make sure you go to the right station for what you want to order. They will take your ticket and write on it. After you eat, you can pay at the register on the end with a credit card or cash at the door. They will check your receipt or charge you at the door before you leave.

We got a Reuben and added pastrami. The meat is so good and they don't skimp on it. The sandwich is huge. We split it between four people which wasn't too much food. We were eating at a lot of other places though. If this is a full meal, I'd recommend splitting it between two people. It also came with pickles.

We got a side of kugel which was really good (more of a dessert). We finished with latkes to go which were incredible.

If you want sides too, I recommend splitting up and sending one person to each station. It's a bit crazy, but probably only took us 30 minutes to wait in line and get our food.

If you want a deli, I can't recommend this place highly enough.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"With over 10k reviews and solid 4 stars I expected more. Staff were all very friendly, informative, and honestly good people. For the hot pastrami on rye and Ruben with corn beef on rye. They were tasty, but definitely not worth 30 bucks for two half sandwiches. House made pickles were yummy. Just wish you could have the bread toasted.

Cashier near the entrance/exit takes cash only. Cashier in the back takes credit cards. Self seating in the middle of the room and server / table side service along the wall.

Pro tip: if your trying this place for the first time and are with others, get half sandwiches so you can try all the meat!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"We planned on visiting here from the get-go because of a recommendation from friend (and born and raised New Yorker). Upon arrival we were greeted by a line out the door. We decided to wait and it moved fairly quickly.

We were greeted by a very tall security guard who handed each adult a paper ticket and said repeatedly, ""You must have your ticket to leave! If you don't, there's a $50 fee!"" Alright. We all tucked our tickets away safely as not to misplace them.. easy enough. We opted for the service portion of the restaurant. We had kids with us and waiting in one of the zillion lines with a zillion people didn't seem like it would work well. We waited for about 20 minutes and had a beer in the mean time.

We were sat and greeted immediately by a waiter with a plate of delicious pickles. We ordered the pastrami, the reuben, matzo ball soup, and a knish. When I food came out the were out of the knish I ordered, so he brought me a different one at no charge-- nice! He later brought the one I ordered too. That's service!  Our food was all delicious. The reuben was A-MAZING. The pastrami was good, but that reuben... man, it was perfection.

We had a great experience here. It was different and we loved it!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Nothing even close to it anywhere, period.  The thick hand carve.  The glorious bark.  The fat.  The juice.  Served just with rye bread and the pickled tomato.

Yes, you need to know the system and deal with it.  Take the ticket, wait in line, deal with all the grumpiness that surrounds you.  Try to find a clean table.  Figure out how to get drinks.  It's SO HECTIC.

This is not the place to be cheap !!!

If your a regular like me and got over getting  free meat samples when waiting on one of the cutters lines do you self a favor and have waiter  / table service !!!  ( yes you gotta tip !! ) like I said don't be cheap !!!

Ask for John aka big mouth or Katey they never disappoint always great service !!!

It's so much easier and In my opinion it makes your experience here even more enjoyable !!!  They have reserved tables  so you don't have to walk around with your food on trays looking for a spot !!!

But by all means if your a first timer eating at Katz's it a must try to get in line with one off their professional meat cutters ... go for it !!!

Also don't loose your ticket !!!

Stopped by Friday morning and got a lean corned beef and a pastrami. The quality is still top notch. The service was awesome. The guy making my sandwich's carves some meat for me to sample while I waited.  The flavor is amazing. I love Rueben sandwiches and no place is Katz's. During COVID-19 you get the food to go but it was still and awesome trip down memory land and the sandwiches which fed 5 people were a huge hit with the next generation!!!  I love Katz's !!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This place is definitely a tourist destination, but it's not just for tourists. I'll be honest, walking in, it was a madhouse. They give you a ticket and tell you if you lose it, you're paying $50. I know it's to curb theft since you order at different counters, but I don't understand why they can't just get a better system.

We went up to the counter and my boyfriend and I ordered a pastrami on rye with mustard. The carver gave us a small dish of pastrami to try. Apparently this is a thing they do, but the carver was very cold, and I wasn't sure what he was trying to do.

I then tried to order a soft drink. I stood at this counter, and the employee barely acknowledged me, but when he did, he'd interrupt me to speak to others that came up behind me, and it took me completely aback.

The sandwich was close to $20 which is outrageously overpriced, but I was able to comfortable share it with my boyfriend. They also gave us both full and half-sour pickles. I usually don't spend more than $10 on a sandwich. It was really, really good, though, so I understand why it's so famous.

When you leave, you gotta hand in your ticket so that way they know what you ordered. Not sure if it's cash only, but it appeared that way and I just paid cash.

I'd probably go again, but their service and ordering system needs some serious work and needs to be brought into the 21st century.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"I dont eat pastrami, but when I do... it's at KATZ!!! Hands down, the best pastrami on earth. It's so juicy and tender, full of flavor, gigantic portions.

Soooooo fudgin delicious!!!!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Do you like sandwiches? soup? general deli food? If you answered yes to any of these questions please come to Katz!! This is one of the places that truly does live up to the hype!! We had a pastrami and a roast beef sandwich with matzo ball soup and everything was delicious. My boyfriend claims it might just just have been the best sandwich of his life and we will definitely be going back to Katz!

While you may think ""oh I don't want to have to wait hours for a sandwich at this NYC hot spot"", if you come at the right time, the wait might only be like 5 minutes... (we came at 11:40 on a Sunday, right before the general lunch rush)... but even if the wait a few minutes more, it is worth it. The food is that good. Plus, the set up here is top notch and they make it so lines move fast. I will say, look online ahead of time at the menu and pick what you want since there are different lines for different items.

Also, as mentioned, you get a ticket when you walk in and they write your order on it and you pay when you leave. Don't lose the ticket (bc you will have to pay a fee), but I also recommend bringing cash if you can for a quicker check out. They do take Credit Cards, but in a separate place in the back, not at the up front register to leave.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This Colorado girl got NY Katz's Delicatessen all the way in the Rocky Mountains!

I received a box of food and treats as a gift from my sister...AWESOME gift, by the way!!! We had hotdogs, brisket, hotdog buns, rye bread, mustard, Russian dressing, everything bagels, latkes, and black & white cookies.  

The hotdogs had that perfect ""snap"" and were juicy and flavorful. The buns were soft and perfect with some Katz's mustard. The latkes fried up nice and easy; crispy potato goodness. We had brisket sandwiches on the rye, served with mustard and Russian dressing. The Russian dressing could be eaten straight off a spoon! The brisket was a little fatty in spots but plentiful and rich. I've had two everything bagels...forget about it! So good!! Oh...and the black and white cookies?  Soft and not too sweet...delightful.

The Katz goodies came well-packaged with plenty of ice packs and directions for the brisket and latkes.

Katz's Delicatessen,"There's a reason this place is famous and fabulous. History. We were lucky enough today to walk right in and wait at a cutting counter to order our Reuben pastrami sandwiches, lean.  The young man preparing them was pleasant, funny, personable all the while working on our magnificent sandwiches.  I was lucky I could finish half a sandwich and I was sure my son would finish the other half off for me. Piled high high high on rye was the leanest most flavorful pastrami, sliced thin. Not too salty, just the right amount of seasoning.  I've been waiting for this sandwich for years and it did not disappoint.  Also walked out with 3 matzo ball soups.

UPDATE.  A few days later, just before leaving to go home, we ordered another couple of pastrami sandwiches to go.  They were just terrible. They were chewy, extremely dry, lacked any kind of flavor.  Could not figure out how it could be so so bad after such a stellar sandwich just a few short days prior.  It was the worst sandwich of ANY kind I've ever had. I just realized, first time we ate at the deli, second time was takeout.  If we'd have gotten such a terrible sandwich the first time I would have taken it back to the counter and had them make two new ones. You absolutely know when you're slicing meat if it's a good or bad cut of meat.  It should have been ground for hash. So I guess they play the percentages of who will come back, brave the crowds, for a refund.  IT'S A $22 dollar sandwich, with tax that's OVER $50 for two.

Upshot, if you have to have a sandwich from them, eat in, otherwise it's a hard pass. As for me, will never eat there again or recommend, not that it will make a difference to them.  There are dozens of excellent delis in Manhattan. Just my way of not supporting a business with shady practices.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This sandwich place just revived my social distancing... completely deserves all the stars I just gave it. To think I didn't even have this sandwich at it's BEST. I will be going back after the lock down to try it in person and not having to warm it up again. I got a regular salami sandwich. The meat inside was cooked perfectly. It tasted like salami, but it felt like brisket! It was so moist and tender. It makes me want to go back and try everything in the menu. I really never think to take pictures of takeout food so I don't have any shots. But I will update my review when I order here again!

10/10 will recommend.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This deli has been around since 1888 and is  famous for way more than being the site of the ""orgasm scene"" in ""When Harry Met Sally"".  

The sandwiches here are HUGE!!! I ordered the 1/2 pastrami sandwich with matzo ball soup and it was  more than enough to fill me up. The flavor was great too! They take pride in what they make. I would come back again because the meat was so tasty and this was my first time trying matzo soup and I loved it.

You can either get table service or you can wait in line at the counter and then find a seat. Waiting at the counter tends to be a shorter wait time.

When you walk in you are handed a yellow ticket and you give that to the carver behind the counter who marks it up with what you ordered. You dO that at the drink station as well and then pay at the final counter. They take cash or card.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

How much better can a pastrami sandwich be than all the other pastrami sandwiches I've had before? Well - I have learned my lesson! Although the sandwich is quite costly, the line is long, and the service can be a bit less than friendly... I'd eat here every day if possible! Holy frick - I don't know what they did to the pastrami but it was better than any sandwich meat I've ever had by far! And the bread- don't get me started!  I can't stand rye...  and theirs is delightfully delicious! How is it possible? I don't know, I don't care, I just want it again!

Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz's diner seems to pop up in the intersection of the venn diagram of most foodies' to-go lists and most tourist guide books, so expect long lines for the experience. The word usage is purposefully chosen; it's the experience of frequenting Katz's, more so than the food, that you are buying. We went mid-Saturday and there was a fairly long line, though at least the line moved quickly.

Honestly, the experience was quite hectic. After you enter the shop, you're given a number, which you must depart with or pay the price, since presenting the number and the proof of your payment is how you exit. Once you're inside, the orderly line gives way to a chaotic free-for-all. It's fairly confusing to figure out which line you're supposed to be in, and if you blindly get in line it's very possible to wait for twenty minutes, only to get to the front and find out that you've been in the wrong line all along. Not to mention the fact that you have to wade through a horde of people in order to get to the back, where you're actually paying for the food. As a pair who did not necessarily go in with a game plan, we felt quite lost. If you have an aversion to crowds and dislike people jostling to get to the front of a confusing queue, this is not the place for you.

Not wanting to wait to be seated, we chose to order our food to go and eat in a park a few blocks away. We ended up getting the pastrami sandwich and the matzo ball soup. I liked the taste of the pastrami, and can see why it made the diner so famous. The portions were filling, and the food was good, but it was quite possibly the most expensive soup and sandwich combo I'd ever ordered, by a long shot. Like I said earlier, you're paying for the experience.

Giving Katz three stars because while the food was good, the prices were steep, and the experience was unnecessarily stressful. It's one of those things I'm glad I checked off once, but probably won't be back to do again.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

There are a lot of places built on hype, but upon entering Katz's Deli and looking at the walls, you realize that there's quite a lot of history and these guys have stuck to their roots. Although the prices have increased due to the hype, the taste is unmistakable and has stood the test of time. It is FANTASTIC!

I wanted to avoid the lines so I showed up at 8am right when they opened. Once the doors opened, I went straight to the counter and ordered 2 pastrami sandwiches with mustard and a reuben with pastrami. Just like that, he started carving and you could see all of the delicious juices getting squeezed out of the hot steamy meat that came directly out of the smoker.

I could barely contain my excitement, so after all of the pics I took a huge bite and it was HEAVENLY. The pastrami just MELTS in your mouth. It is so soft and tender and loaded with smokey peppery flavor. The Reuben was the same animal but a different BEAST! The sauerkraut, cheese, and sauce complimented the sandwich perfectly! The pastrami is a classic, but if you want an explosion of flavor I'd recommend the Reuben with pastrami!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

I was a little annoyed when the couple ahead of us after standing in line for almost an hour needed another 20 min at the front to debate what to get.

The cutter had great charisma and it seemed like they all were very personable with the customers.  We got a pastrami sandwich to share given it's enormous size.

I wanted to add sauerkraut to my sandwich but they ran out. Such a bummer. We added cheese, but thought it was weird it wasn't melted on or anything. It was just cold cheese on top.

I ordered the Pastrami on Rye with Slaw to get it close to the Langer's #19. They even give you a little sliver as you wait and all I could think was ""NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!"" I was glad I had some hand sanitizer with me cuz I ain't tryna get that corona on the side yadig?

Though it was more expensive, that pastrami is the literal truth. I was blown away. That teaser they give you as they cut that PHAT stack was the perfect morsel to whet your appetite.

First bite. I entered another dimension of existence. As I approached the plane of spiritual enlightenment and saw the landmark that is Langer's in my food memories, I continued to rise beyond it. Though I still think Langers has a more structurally sound sandwich and is simply a better sandwich overall (cheese and slaw complement perfectly on that) the Katz pastrami blows it out the water.

The food is INCREDIBLY overpriced, and I'm not sure why this has become such a tourist destination other than the impressive clientele of celebrities who have frequented it. For context, their pastrami sandwich, which was loaded with meat in their defense, was $24!!! For a sandwich!!!

We wish we would have known how big they were before ordering one per person. I don't love meat, so I got a grilled cheese, which was actually very good. The pastrami sandwich was flavorful but VERY fatty, so much so that I couldn't eat it. The only thing other than the meat on the sandwich was a very thin layer of mustard. The brisket sandwich was incredibly dry, and again, only had a thin layer of mustard.

The fries were steak fries and were pretty average. The chili dog was super spicy (beware), and the cheeseburgers looked like McDonald's ones, but didn't taste as good.

When you walk in, you're given a ticket. You then proceed to the counter and order from the butchers. They let you try the meat before ordering which is pretty cool, and a hefty serving of it. After you eat, if you're paying cash, then you proceed to the front door to pay, but if you're card, then you have to go back to the counter. For 6 of us, the bill was about $150, which is ridiculous. We ordered basically one ""entree"" per person and 2 sides of fries. They certainly know how to poach you.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"It's where Harry met Sally & it's delicious.

I love Katz!! Again this place is always crowded of course. But totally worth it and the line moves very quickly.

I like the authenticity of the place, you order at the counter - they give you a sample taste of the meat they are serving you and bam. Once that meat just melts in your mouth, it's game over.

Def a place that goes down in history for its pastrami. I even ran into the karate kid here one time!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"It's cold AF in New York right now and thankfully the line moved pretty quickly for us when we were lined up outside. Once inside, they give you a ticket that you have to hold onto and warn you there is a fee for losing the ticket. Afterwards, you have the option of either ""waiter service"" or ""self-service,"" we did the self-service because the ""waiter service"" was 35minutes. Basically, either they sit you down, take your order, and serve you OR you do the whole thing yourself at the many counters available to take your order.

Our group split up, four of us stayed in line for the counter while the other two went looking for tables that were NOT marked with ""waiter service."" When you're at the front of the counter, they're patient enough to give you any kind of sample of meat you are interested in. My friend told me they watched a lady sampled pretty much all the options. I can't tell you the prices because I had my fiancé go up and order while I sat at the table but one of my girlfriends said ordering the combo (soup and half sandwich) was a good deal.

My fiancé and I split the whole sandwich Reuben pastrami, half sandwich brisket, and matzo ball soup. OMG, the Reuben pastrami was so fucking good. The meat was so tender, tasty, and juicy. And I think making it a Reuben was perfect. I would say 6/5 rating! The brisket was ok, I think I like my brisket more on the wet side, was not a fan of the dryness. Even adding the Dijon mustard did not help. I would say 3/5. The matzo ball was so good! It was light, flavorful, and just comforting for this cold ass day.

So they write the total bill on your ticket and you can pay with card in the back or cash in the front. Even if your ticket is blank, because you were the one who sat down and someone else ordered, you still need to submit your ticket.

Worth the hype!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This is a place that you have have to try if you are in Newyork. It's a bit Strange procedure to order food. They give you a ticket when you get in and you can order food they will mark in the ticket when you order.  You pay bill when you are leaving out through the door. The place is big and it has lot of seating inside as well.
I got the Pastrami and it was delicious and my wife loved it too. It's a staple here. I got with some cheese on top of it as well. One sandwich is enough for two people, so do not over order. It's a bit pricy but it's worth a try.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Best pastrami sandwich I've ever had! I was a little skeptical at first but everyone was recommending it to me. We swung by after a night out and it was fairly empty. It probably gets a lot busier later when the clubs and bars start closing.

When you walk in, you're handed a ticket. Each person will get one even if you're not ordering anything. Keep it on you and return it to the cashier at the front when you leave. If you lose it, I believe you'll get charged a fee.

Whatever you're trying to order will have it's own line. There are signs above that list what items you can get from that particular section of the restaurant.

While the guy was prepping the pastrami sandwich, he cut a couple of slices for us to sample. And maybe I've just always had average pastrami but these slices reminded me more of brisket. Fatty pieces, thicker slices. So perfectly seasoned that you really don't need to add any sauces to it. The sandwich itself is pretty thick and I had to kind of squeeze it down to fit bites into my mouth.

It's an expensive sandwich but it's worth it. I couldn't finish the whole meal in one sitting. For leftovers, just bring your plate to the back cashier and they'll wrap it up for you. If you're paying with credit card, then you pay at the back cashier and show your receipt to the front when you exit.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"One late night, one of my friends suggested we all go here to grab something to eat. It was like after 2 in the morning and this place was jammed packed. I always remember passing here as a little girl when my aunt lived in the city but never went inside.

You get a ticket as you enter and you stand on line for one of the many butchers to prepare your meal. It was different and interesting. I don't even remember the orders we made but I know my sandwich was a turkey sandwich. One of my friends treated me to it since it was my first time having it and said if I didn't like it at least I didn't pay for it lol. It was pricey too, like $24 for that sandwich.

I ate half of my sandwich when I got home and saved the other piece for the next day. As seen in the pic, there was a piece of pastrami that got mixed into my sandwich (I was a little annoyed by that). It was a good sandwich but I had better from my local corner store deli.

If I'm ever nearby in the city looking for a late night sandwich, I might consider returning. Definitely glad I experienced it though.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"That line! But don't worry, it moves fast!

Once in, you are given the option to order at the counter and try your luck at finding a table to sit down. If you don't want to do that, give your name, step to the side and wait for table service.

For our party of two, we shared a pastrami sandwich, matzo ball soup and ginormous fries.  Fries were crispy on the outside and tender inside. Matzo ball soup was the best I've had. Broth was rich but light and the matzo was pillowy and a perfect texture. Pastrami had such a freaking good flavor that the bread wasn't even needed. So good!

Once seated for table service, they set you up with pickles, as you wait for the food.

One thing, don't ask for mayo on your sandwich! The table next to us asked for it was was quickly shut down.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"A-MA-ZING!
This is a staple when visiting NYC, though I would HIGHLY recommend a midweek visit to avoid the line around the corner!  Katz's has been an institution since 1888, if you can believe that!  
We arrived at 1:30 on Saturday afternoon, and found ourselves in line 1/2 way down Houston, but boy the wait is worth it.
You have 2 options - table service or order your own at the counters & find a table. We opted for #, given then 30-35 minute wait quoted for a table.
The lines are a bit chaotic, but we spread out to see who would wind up belly up to the carver 1st......
All meat is carved to order, and portions are beyond generous.  Don't forget to tip your carver & ask for extra pickles (I prefer the dill to the 1/2 dill)
Fries, cole slaw, and other sides are ordered at another counter, along with drinks.  
One thing to ALWAYS remember.... DO NOT lose your ticket.  Everyone who walks in gets a ticket, whether you eat or not..... they will charge you $50 if you lose it!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz's Delicatessen is a life changing foodie experience. I've seen Katz's on multiple food/travel TV shows in the past and I've been dying to try this place out since. Cue a trip to New York to cross Katz's off my culinary bucket list. My meal at Katz's Delicatessen absolutely met (if not exceeded) my extremely high expectations walking in.

On the note of walking in, this place is a bit anxiety-inducing if you're not a fan of crowds. It was absolutely packed when we came around 1:30 pm on a weekday. Luckily, Katz's has a system down. You can either put your name down for table seating, or you can order at the deli counter and find seating. It was a neat experience to see the deli boys cut the meat, and it was awesome that they give you samples of each meat so you can try it before committing. While it was so insanely crowded in here (almost shoulder to shoulder at some points), there are at least five different lines you can order from and the lines move relatively quickly.

My partner and I decided on getting a pastrami reuben and a corned beef reuben. These were legitimately the best reubens I've had in my entire life. I still dream about both, and it makes my foodie heart sad that I can only eat this in New York. It's hard to pick a favorite of the two, as both were so damn good. I will mention though that the corned beef was a bit leaner and lighter tasting than the pastrami, which was richer and heavier.

The reubens were put together excellently; the bread well-toasted, the cheese gooey and melty, and the spread filled with delicious diced pickles. However, what really made these sandwiches special were the meats. The meat was so tender that it just fell apart in my mouth and it was so well-seasoned, highlighting the wonderful marbling throughout the cuts of meat. Words alone simply don't do the taste justice; just trust me (and the other 11,000+ reviews) that you absolutely need to try Katz's at least once in your life. Yes, this is a $20 sandwich. But for the portion size (I didn't finish my sandwiches and I regret it SO much that I didn't eat all of it) and the overall taste, it's worth every single penny. Plus, you're in New York! Things are generally expensive.

In short, Katz's Delicatessen lives up to all of the hype. My meal at Katz's was one of the best meals I've ever had. The only downside is that Katz's has now set the bar so high for what a delicious reuben tastes like.

PS: Everyone get a ticket when they walk in. The sandwich guys write your order on the ticket and you present your ticket to the cashier to pay. Even if you don't order anything, make sure that you hold on to your ticket and present it to the cashier with the rest of your party. If you don't have your ticket, you'll get hit with a $50 fine!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz's Deli

Walked up around 3:15pm and there was a line about 50ft, got in the door in about 5 to 7 minutes and then had to go to a ""cutter"" to prepare our sandwiches.

Pastrami on Italian $22.95, was it worth it? This is New York and Katz's Deli is a must.

You can be seated and be served or go through the cutter lines and then find your own seat.

I would recommend to experience going through the cutter line to experience the New York style deli preperation.

I loved their Pastrami, maybe next time I will get it on rye.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Living in NY for the last 4 months, I knew I had to make my way to this deli. We got there around 2:30 and the line was probably 20 people deep outside, but it was moving smoothly enough that we only waited in line for about 15 minutes before making it inside. As you're going through the door they hand you a ticket; make sure you keep this ticket even if you're just coming in to take a look. You have to give to the front desk when you come out. Making it inside, we were then filtered into smaller lines - there's a front desk person to help direct you to the shortest line for the meat cutters. That line took about 10 minutes before we got to put in order.

We ordered the Pastrami and Corned Beef Hot Sandwich with mayo to the side. While the cutter was prepping our sandwich he cut a small piece of pastrami for us to taste. And oh man, this pastrami was soft and tender.

Once you get your food, you're pretty much left on your own to find a free table. They do have a waiter service but when we were there it was about a 30 minute wait. There are also more tables towards the back and right of the restaurant.

Both sandwiches were hefty with plenty of meat. I could only finish half of my sandwich. They also give you a plate of pickles - one sour and one more cucumbery. My friend enjoyed the corned beef because it wasn't too salty but still had their unique corned beef flavor. This is coming from someone who normally doesn't like corned beef. The pastrami sandwich was really good as well with the meat tender and soft, but it was really salty. I needed plenty of water after eating this sandwich. Overall both sandwiches were good but I do think it's too pricey to urge me to come back.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Crazy busy place!

This place was a unique deli because you order your food on the side of the restaurant and eat is the left. There is Self serve service and some tables have waiters.

The sandwiches ranges from $18-30. A little pricy.

The best food there was their Potato Latkas! Super yummy with the Sour Cream!

You get a ticket when you walk in and you MUST SHOW YOU'RE TICKET TO LEAVE!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"One of the must visits on my list when I visit NYC.  The line was long but it moved along just fine.  I chose to wait for a seat instead of joining the chaos of self serve.

I love the pickles they drop of when you sit down.  I have to be careful not to overeat the pickles.  :)

I ordered their pastrami reuben.  It is just a fine sandwich.  Mrs. K. has the brisket and it was outstanding.  Just to be friendly Mrs. K. ordered a cheesecake.  The was the only flaw in the experience. Not the best cheesecake by a longshot.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"I don't eat pastrami very often, but by how delicious their pastrami sandwich is, I assume they're one of the best. This place is insanely popular, so prepare for crowds and hunting for a spot to sit.

When you go in, everyone is given a ticket that must be returned upon leaving (this is how they track if you ordered something and need to pay). Then you stand in one of the lines to the counter, where you can ask for samples of the meats and order your food. They will prepare your meal in front of you (i.e. slice the meat) and write what your ordered on your ticket. They have self serve water, and my meal (pastrami sandwich and matzoh ball soup) came with two types of pickles. They accept both card and cash.

The pastrami sandwich was very good; the man who prepared the sandwich recommended just getting mustard (vs mayo), so I would recommend that for anyone else stopping in as well.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Came back while I was in town. How the hell is this pastrami as good as the last time? Magic. This time I opted for a Dr. Brown Root Beer instead of a chocolate egg cream. Staff still super nice.

Brought half of my sandwich home to my mom. Would have bought her own had the sandwiches not cost $21 each. Still, worth it if you got it.

However: The cutter did not give me the ritual plate of meat while-you-wait. I would have totally forgotten had the girl next to me not had been happily chomping away while her cutter worked his magic. And I was too self-conscious to point out his mistake.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Get a table

This was our first time here and we opted for getting a table, the lines for the carvers were very long. With a party of four and on a Sunday afternoon, it only took us about 15 minutes to be seated.

The service was reasonably quick (for NYC) and the food was delicious.
Pastrami with cheese was huge, enough for two people. Pastrami was flavorful and so tender. Matzo Ball soup was hearty and really hits the spot. Potato latkes (3 per order) hot and fried to perfection. Wash it all down with a Dr. Browns soda and you are set.

Its a bit pricey ($20+ per person) but for the amount of food and it being a classic NY establishment, it's not bad. Overall very happy with our lunch here and will definitely return again.

*Hang on to your ticket*",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Okay, you can go ahead and say it, everyone likes Katz's so giving it a bad review is pretty much sacrilege.  I like to think of myself as someone who, while I get very excited about trying popular places, I try not to let popularity cloud my opinion of the actual food.  Katz's was an especially hard case of this, as Jewish delis serve some of my favorite food on Earth, and this is arguably the most popular Jewish deli on Earth.  

With all of that said, Katz's lived up to all of my expectations and then some.

We waited in the LONG line for about 30-40 minutes before getting inside and handed two tickets.  For those of you who have never been, the guys making the sandwiches write your orders on these tickets, and the tickets are presented to the cashier to pay.  Losing one of these tickets results in a $50 penalty (each member of the party receives a ticket, whether or not they use it).

We waited another 20-25 minutes at the counter to order our sandwich.  At this point, the wait was getting to us and we were very hungry.  We went for a pastrami reuben on rye, with fries and two drinks.  This order ran us upwards of $40, which for one sandwich, fries and two drinks is obviously incredibly expensive, but it's Katz's so fair enough.

The sandwich was absolutely delicious.  The pastrami is nice, thick slices, the sauerkraut is delicious, the rye is very fresh and the fries are piping hot and perfectly washed down with Dr. Brown's root beer.  The pickles and cucumbers served on the side of each sandwich are absolutely delicious and perfectly compliment the meal.

The meal was delicious, fully living up to my expectations which were outrageously high to begin with.  But, on top of the meal, the experience was everything I wanted out of the most famous deli in NYC, and overall was everything I wanted it to be.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Long lines beware and very noisy inside. Once you make it in take your ticket and don't lose it. Then you stand in another line behind a cutter. Some are not as fast as others. And people tend to cut in line. Should have a better way to organize this but I guess it's working for them.

They do offer waited service. But try to grab a seat around the corner and not in the middle where it's a bit crazy.

We had the pastrami sandwich. The rye bread gets pretty soggy fast. The pastrami was lights out amazing. Pretty pricey for a sandwich and wish there was less fat on it. Guess they have an upgraded price for that too

Confusing checking out. If you pay with cash go to the exit otherwise a card was back by the cutters.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Corned beef was tender and flavorful, the Russian dressing was creamy, and the sauerkraut finished off the sandwich perfectly. Deli pickles were a treat - I could seriously eat those by the bucket!  
Portion size was VERY generous (they don't skimp on meat here) and easily fed both my boyfriend and I. If you're looking for a native NYC experience, check it out!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"My fiance and I were staying a friend's house in the neighborhood and figured we had to stop by Katz's Deli since it was just a few blocks away. We walked over the morning after Thanksgiving at around 11:30 am and only had to wait about 5 minutes before going inside. You have the choice to order at the counter or wait for a table. We decided to order at the counter and figured a spot at a table would open up. Since I saw that the sandwiches were pretty big and I always need to have matzo ball soup, I got the half pastrami sandwich and soup. My fiance got the Reuben sandwich which is corned beef, swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and sauerkraut and he added pastrami. We each couldn't even finish our food so we brought it home for a snack after our nap :)

Although this is definitely a place tourists go to, it's definitely one of the best delis I have been too. I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in

There are a few different lines to choose from there are the sandwich lines, lines for the grill, and a line for sides/drinks.
The sandwiches are on the pricier side as far as sandwiches go so keep that in mind.

Katz's Delicatessen,"I love this place so so so so so much!  I keep coming back and this place has been here forever and a day!  This is a true NY classic.  It may look like a tourist trap, but it is not.  It is filled with locals, like me, that love their food because the taste and quality is consistent.  This is how you run a restaurant, by keep your customer fan base by continuing to serve the same delicious food that first got you famous.  A lot of places that often become famous often change their recipes and their quality goes down.  Katz is thankfully not like that.  

Yes, this place is super packed and crowded.  It may look intimidating when you walk in, but the line goes quick.  Definitely highly recommend checking this place out if you like this type of food.  It is well worth the price.  Your tummy will be happy.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Katz's Delicatessen,"Had to stop by along the way through the city of course. The lines are no joke really but about the same as any relatively popular place that I had been to between waiting in line and getting a table to the service lapses if that's the dilemma. The guys at the counter were extremely helpful with questions despite the mad shuffle going on inside. Waters were available in the back along with a host of plastic cups to use.

Honestly, I think the hardest part was finding a seat more so than anything else. The tables didn't feel crazy packed together though. I had gotten a matzo ball soup and a reuben. Half of that went with me for the flight back actually. The reuben was good and clean. Didn't wow me per se, just a deli sandwich tho at the end of the day. The matzo ball soup was much better here than the other time I tried it. Broth definitely held up well and made a better meal out of it for sure.

In retrospect, I think next time I'm through I'll get a pastrami. Not that the reuben didn't hit the mark, I just think the pastrami is more visually appealing. Eat with the eyes before the stomach after all.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

This was by far, withhold a doubt, the best deli I've ever experienced in my entire life!
I'll have what she''s having!!!
Truly ORGASMMIC experience !",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Living in California, there are very few proper Jewish delicatessens. On my annual (up until now) pilgrimage to NYC where I was born, I ALWAYS make it a point to have lunch at Katz's, at least once (usually twice), during my trip. I go there both for the food and the experience, both of which are too-notch and can't be found anywhere else.

Like everyone else, I've been getting a bit ""antsy"" during this extended quarantine and I've been longing for a Katz's Deli experience. My solution to this problem was to order Katz's food  delivery to my home.
A couple of weeks ago I ordered what they call ""A taste of New York"" (I believe) which included sliced corned beef and pastrami, rye bread, hot dogs, buns, mustard, sauerkraut, sour pickles and a salami. Mmmmm Good! My father-in-law who has never been to NYC, proclaimed that the food was ""excellent"" and thought that the Katz's mustard in particular, was the best that he's ever had. I just retired after 25 years as a firefighter and I also purchased a larger mail order meal for my brothers and sisters in the firehouse.

With the success of these purchases still in my mind and my appetite whetted for more, I placed a second order of hot dogs/buns, extra mustard (for dad) and a whole pastrami (which will require further cooking).

Is the food expensive? Yes! Is the taste and quality of the food exceptional? Yes! Yes! While expensive, free shipping over $100, makes the price more reasonable. UPS 2nd Day Air actually takes 3-4 days, but not to worry as Katz's packages the order in a very gnarly insulated shipping container, with freezer packs.
The food arrived cold/coolboth times, with the freezer
packs still somewhat intact.

I hope to cook the whole pastrami within a week, so I'll be sharpening up my carving knives. Until I can make it back to Katz's Deli in NYC, this food should hold me over. Stay Healthy, Happy and Sane!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz's may be one of the most iconic places to eat in the United States.  And, with it being open since 1898, it has a good reason to be.  With that being said, if you are making a trip to NY and need a place to check out, you might as well come here.  If you are big on delis and Kosher style food, Russ & Daughters is literally right down the street too.

I will tell you, this place never sleeps, and I don't think there is really a time this place isn't crowded (unless you go in the wee hours).  I went late on a Saturday night, and there was a healthy crowd, along with a large security guard that handed me a ticket (I made sure I didn't lose that ticket, as I didn't want to catch a beating from him on the way out, he looked hungry that night).  The ticket is your way in and out- it pretty much keeps track of what you eat.

For the longest time, this place has been cash only (there is an ATM right behind the security guard)- at least that is what I have always heard.  However, near the back, there is another counter, that you can pay with a card (I didn't go back there so in terms of what kind of cards, I am not sure).

There are a lot of choices here, and the prices seem somewhat steep.  However, keep this in mind- you get a lot of food (one sandwich comes huge and with 2 types of whole pickles) for what you pay for.  More on that in a minute.

You have the option to eat table service or counter service- so be careful where you sit when you eat (the tables should be marked).  We went for the counter service- I heard the butchers here are like some of the most famous people of all of New York (like the butlers at the St Regis or the bell men at the Plaza, or the players on the New York Yankees)- so you should see what the hype is all about.  They will keep conversation going, and they will win you over.  Hell, they will even give you some extra slices.  Fill up their tip jars- I think they make as much as a stripper in Atlanta, but they get to keep their clothes on!

Seeing how big the portions were (and also eating at 5 other places that day), I decided to split a pastrami sandwich with my buddy- which was a good call on our part.  The sandwiches were huge, so, if you go a on food tour like we did- I suggest you split one.  There is a water trough in the back, I suggest you take advantage of, as there is a lot of sodium about to be consumed.  I did not take advantage of that.

The sandwich (served on rye) was pretty tasty.  The meat was solid.  I mean, it was some solid pastrami.  I am slowly becoming more of a fan of rye, so for what it was, I did appreciate it.  Was it the best pastrami sandwich I have had?  It was top 3, overall for me.  For a deli sandwich, I would say it was also right near the top.  The pickles (which also I have been slowly eating more of), were ok, but if I had to pick one, I liked the brighter ones a little better.  Those aren't your pickles you get in a grocery store, which is something I can appreciate.

Upon leaving, the cashier was pretty efficient.  They also had merch for sale there too.  After you pay, your ticket is marked worthy for exit, and when you hand it off, the guy almost looks pissed you had a paid ticket (I am telling you, he was hungry that night).

A few things I can appreciate about this place- they ship all over (go to their website or goldbelly.com) all sorts of stuff.  Also, I noticed, even for having over 11500 reviews, I liked that the manager would comment on the reviews posted on here- so even though they are a mecca, they still keep the customer service- something that can seem to be overlooked on highly popular places.  I will definitely come back in the future, and I suggest you put this on your bucket list as well!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"These sandwiches are huge. Fresh bread stacked with loads of tender flavorful meat in between. My boyfriend and I split a pastrami and it was enough for us. Definitely could not have finished two whole sandwiches.

Their set up needs improvement. The line breaks into smaller lines, but the smaller lines goes straight into the seating area, making it hard to get to the lines further down and find seats.

Verdict: It's good, but I don't know if I'd go back. Like it's good to try, but it's not something I'd crave or anything. And their sandwiches are pretty pricey, $22 for a pastrami. I know meat can be expensive and they give you a good amount, but that's probably the most expensive sandwich I've had before.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Best pastrami I have ever had! I feel like I've been saying that about a lot of food since I've arrived in NYC. The food here is just unbelievable, and this deli is yet another jackpot.

The process of getting the sandwich can be a bit confusing, so let me break it down for you: Each adult receives a paper ticket. You proceed to the counter which has about 10 different lines from which you can grab your food from. They will cut the meat in front of you, carving away the fat and leaving the prime pieces. The lines are very long and disorganized but well worth it in the end. Once you get your sandwich, you total will be put on the paper ticket which you give to the ticket counter to pay once you are done eating.

The sandwiches here are definitely large enough to share and are priced as such ($22). The sandwich is loaded with piles of pastrami between two slices of bread slathered generously with mustard. The meat was so flavorful and tender that it just fell apart with the slightest force. I could have done without the bread and mustard and just eaten the meat on its own- it was that good!

Now that I've tried the pastrami here, there is no way that I can go back to the pre-packaged pastrami from the grocery store! This is a place that you must go to when in NYC. You will not regret it!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"It was pretty packed, but there are several lines where you can order from, so the wait was about 10 minutes for me.

Definitely on the pricer side, Reuben sando w/ pastrami (~$27), but  i think it's worth trying! It was stuffed with so much meat, the sando was as thick as my palm! and I loved the sauce, onions along with it",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Wow! This place met beyond my expectations.

To be honest, I was not familiar with their specialties when I walked in since I'm from the West coast. When I went to order a hot salami sandwich, the guy behind the counter asked if I really wanted that. And I go, I should probably get the pastrami huh? He kindly said he didn't want to tell me what to get, but that they were known for their pastrami sandwiches. He cut some pastrami pieces for me to try, and I agreed to an order of that with mustard and no mayo. His patience and humor already made the experience welcoming.

The meat was extremely tender. I'm not a huge fan of pastrami, but boy, this meat really melts in your mouth. If you've never been here before, I highly recommend it. The staff is friendly, the service is quick, and the pastrami sandwich is top notch. You won't leave disappointed.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,Overpriced and just a tourist spot now. The quality is not great and a sandwich is over $30.00..,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"My fiance wanted to stop here during his visit to the city. To be honest, for someone that grew up in Jersey I didn't know about this place. However, it's a must see according to him. We stopped by and the line was ridiculous. You got a ticket and had to stand in this long line. I didn't order anything but he got a sandwich. The new pickles were not to my liking but the old pickle was great.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"I'll just get right to the point; this place is overrated and used to be better. I don't care how many celebrities or presidents have been here. Don't get me wrong, their pastrami on rye is an excellent pastrami sandwich, but it's less meat than what used to be, and the price is jokingly expensive. The pastrami on rye and the corned beef Ruben after tax was over $50. The Ruben was nothing special. I commend them for getting way with this tourist pricing because people will always line up out the door for this iconic spot, and the cash has to flow to support the army of workers they have in there. I think they could charge even more for their food and nobody would even flinch based on the sheer volume of orders packed to the ceiling, ready to be shipped out across the country.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"No trip to NYC is complete without my obligatory stop at Katz's for a pastrami on rye with mustard.  The entire experience is magical...it's like Disney World for a fat guy.  You come in and get your ticket from the security guard that would give Suge Knight a run for his money.  You wait in line, they give you samples of whatever you're getting, grab your beverage and find your table.  

I don't like cliche's but the way Meg Ryan enjoyed her sandwich is what you should be expecting.  Savor whatever it is you get, because it is all just THAT GOOD.  

Some words of advice, they're open 24 hours so you can go whenever.  I don't like to wait if possible and could eat this 24 hours a day.  I always go in on Sunday mornings and have never waited in line.  Don't lose your ticket though....they don't like that too much.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Pastrami sandwich. Best meal in nyc, without a doubt. We used to live across the street and had to limit the number of times that we were allowed to eat there per year!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Love that this place is open 24 hours. They always seem to be busy, but we managed to go around 5 and it wasn't too bad. We maybe waited 10 mins to get to the counter to order.

The sandwiches are so big that I was able to share it with my husband. But then we were both kinda sad because their pastrami sandwich is the best and totally worth the almost $20 price for one. But make sure to save your ticket or else that sandwich will be a lot more expensive. The ticket they give you at the entrance will run you $50 if you loss it. I would also recommend bringing cash. They do take credit but you'll have to remember to go to the back of the restaurant to pay with credit.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"I got the Katz's Pastrami Sandwich and it was savory, juicy, filling, salty, mouthwatering, and flavorful. I also got the Matzo ball soup, the Matzo ball was delightful and the soup itself was a little too salty but nevertheless delicious. The only reason I'm giving my review a 4/5 is because I paid $22.95 for the sandwich... I understand the brand factor of the restaurant and I would probably still pay that much for this sandwich, but it's still $22.95",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Katz's Delicatessen,"Half and half pastrami with brisket is the go to. With mustard. Their different lines to order is quite efficient, because it's actually making the food that takes some time - not the wait.

Keep your ticket they give upon entering as that's basically your receipt, and a lost fee is applied if you don't have one! You pay before you leave.

The brisket was extremely tender and juicy. I got both brisket and pastrami so I think that definitely played with the flavoring more, and added extra taste. Tasted even better with mustard and pickles!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Came here because it is a New York staple! Beware that it's a tourist haven so it's extremely busy and pricy. We came for pastrami sandwiches and weren't disappointed. They were stacked, hot and delicious. The matzo ball soup was hot and delicious. It tasted pretty fresh also. Only thing is the fries were very meh. They weren't season or cooked super well. Basically, I've had better fries elsewhere, but then again that's not why people come. Overall a great experience. And tip: don't lose your ticket or it's a $50 fee!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Really fun place to get the best pastrami. I love it!

I could say some things I don't like about this place pretty easily but I think this place should just be graded on the atmosphere and the pastrami. Although I hear they make the best hot dog in the city. Pricey but fun!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This is my first time going here since many years ago and it is as great as I remember it! I was lucky on a Monday night because there wasn't a line. The dine in area was also not packed. Weekends here are insane! Anyway, you get a ticket as you go in so you can present it to the cutters who will take your order. They will mark your order on that ticket. Also take care of that ticket because you will need to present this on your way out. For that recent visit, I got a pastrami sandwich. I love that they give you a pretty good amount of sample slice to munch on. The pastrami was so delicious and savory. I got a side of pickle to-go.

The service was great that evening. The cutter was kind. I will come back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"I am giving Katz's Deli a 5 star not only because of the tasty food but because of the great customer serivce that Theresa gave me.  I ordered my ""birthday package"" and it shipped on time, however UPS failed to deliver it Next day, sadly it turned into 5 days.  But anyway, I kept in touch with Katz (probably overkill, but I wanted it so badly) and Theresa responded and shipped out a new package for me and also credited back my shipping cost.  

Needless to say when the new box arrived I was ready to go.. had my water boiling and dropped a package of pastrami and corned beef into the water to reheat and made my sandwhiches for my husband and I and it took us right back to New York and we happily relived our visit there...the sandwhich was probably not as big (saving some meat for another sandwhich) but with the mustard, bread and pickles it was tasty as ever!  Thank you again and I will reorder.  Stay safe and sane!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Got a taste of Katz's when they did a collab with Au Cheval in Chicago, so I knew I had to go when I visited New York. But also, so many people have told me I had to make a stop there. My friend and I went pretty early in the morning and it was our first time there, so we were a bit confused about the process. Since there weren't many people there, the workers were a bit more patient with us. We just ordered the classic pastrami and we're so glad that the two of us shared it because it was a monster of a sandwich! I'm usually not a big fan of mustard, but the mustard added a nice and slight kick. Also, the pickles - perfect.

When you walk in, you get a ticket (DONT LOSE THIS). On the very right side there's a smaller menu, but they also just have it up on the wall. You order wherever someone is ready to take your order, you grab your stuff, take it to the cashier and they write on your ticket. You go and eat, then once you're done, go back to the cashier and pay. They'll give you your ticket and receipt back and you have to hand it to the guy at the door, and then you're good to go.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Definitely worth the hype. We came here on a Saturday and waited for about 30 minutes to try this place out. Being that I'm from LA, their setup kind of reminded me of Philippe's setup back home (obviously they sell different things though).

We ordered the combo sandwich which came with both pastrami and corned beef. The sandwich was about $21, but was definitely more than enough to share for two people.

The pastrami was some of the best pastrami's I've ever had...EVER. It was definitely drool-worthy and just had that type of taste where you want to close your eyes after that first bite.

The corned beef, however, was a little odd for me. It didn't have the same flavor that I'm familiar with. Maybe that's how the restaurant makes it, but to me it had a weird after taste.

IMO: Skip the corned beef and stick with the pastrami!

Definitely a must visit place when coming to NYC!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"""Reuben, with pastrami, on club bread"" just trust me. Your welcome

That's all you need to know. Then get a beer, they have their own Katz IPA .

Always tip your cutter. That's the guy making the sandwich. Bring cash, dont lose your ticket. Enjoy",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"One of my favorite places.
This was my third time here and will always get the same exact thing. Must get the hot pastrami and chili cheese dog!

Katz's Delicatessen,"This is a review I shoulda done 30 years ago.
Before 1989's When Harry Met Sally, which I didn't even think was all that, killed the heart and soul.  Yeah, yeah, I know the scene.  That's crazy though, I don't want those juices mixing with these juices.
It was 5 stars when the cutters actually had heart and soul and pride.
When if you wanted toasted rye, they would toast it.  If you wanted lean, medium or fatty, you'd get what you wanted.  Tip?  Never heard of a tip.  Now you gotta grease palms before you get your greasy sandwiches.
Before every two-bit politician had to have a photo-op.
So, counting from the 1989 death knell, that makes 31 years of tourist mediocrity and counting...",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"What: Pastrami on rye
How much: $22.00
How does it work: Walk in or sit down. They give you a ticket at the door and you give the ticket to the counter once your sandwich is made. You pay when you exit the place since the cashier is by the door.
Review: Thick stacks of meat. Very well seasoned and cooked perfectly. They let you try the meat before you buy, that's a plus for me. Can definitely shareable between 2 people unless you can eat fat stack of meats.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz's is a very popular Lower East Side deli. They're famous for their large meat sandwiches. Ive heard several people say its the best corned beefed/or rueben they've ever had. I'm not a huge meat eater so I usually get fries and a soda.

Extremely popular with tourists, this place is always packed with a line out the door. Its chaotic and hard to understand how it all works.

A few notes that might help you:

-You take a ticket and go to the counter to order your food from the men making it or sit down at a Waiter Table.
-Tables against the wall are Waiter Service Only, tables in the middle are Self Serve meaning you order at the counter then sit down.
-The front door register is cash only. If you're paying with a card, pay at the back register.

This is a no frills cafeteria style diner with high prices, rushed orders and wet school lunch trays. The French fries were ok.

We take out of town relatives here because they've heard of it and they want to go but we never go outside of that.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"At this point, Katz is almost like the Statue of Liberty - You really want to visit because it's so famous, but you also know it is packed with tourists. Both are true. If it's a holiday or a weekend, be ready to stand in a very long line, squeeze between tourists and hunt for a table. Is it worth it? Yes, as long as you know what to order. Skip the corned beef - It's incredibly chewy, but the pastrami is divine. All sandwiches are very generous, and not too expensive. I'm a big guy, came hungry, and one of these bad boys was enough. If you still have some room, have the matzo ball soup - We were there when it was raining outside, and even though we didn't take the soup, it looked and smelled amazing.
Pro tip - Rain = No tourists.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"So glad we made the trek to Katz's Delicatessen. I love me a good pastrami sandwich.. seriously is probably my favorite type of sandwich and there aren't too many places in Seattle that serve it (or they do but they give you a measly 2 slices which isn't enough). Yes, the sandwiches are $25 but there's no way you'll be able to finish the whole thing (I did the ""open face sandwich method"" with half a sandwich) and I was full. Even my friend's husband (who is very picky) was amazed and finished the other half of the sandwich and raved about how good I was.

Katz's Delicatessen,"One of the Originals. Katz's Delicatessen is excellent. The meats on the sandwiches will melt in your mouth. The breads are always fresh. The pickles are tasty also.

Katz's not only has sandwiches, they have a variety of other dishes including fresh turkey, and of course soup. If your not in NYC, Katz's ships nationwide.

Still one of the best places to eat in NYC.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This is a New York City institution and for good reason. The meat is so good. The pastrami on rye is to die for, as are their pickles. Eating here so much more than just about the food or the service, it's an entire experience. Grabbing a ticket, standing in line, sampling the meat while they hack away at your pastrami sandwich.

It is quite pricey as far as sandwiches go, but I think if you're in NYC and don't go to Katz once in your life, have you really lived life at all?",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"An iconic location. You have to come here and try their sandwiches, they are as good as you have heard I promise! Protip: know what you want by the time you get to the front, the lines are crazy so don't keep anyone waiting longer than necessary.

Initially I had my heart set on pastrami on rye, but being the indecisive person I am, I settled for corn beef on rye with added pastrami. Both are somewhat similar, but this way I get to try to different meats which is the highlight of the sandwich. They pack this meat on! I don't think I've ever had such a stuffed sandwich while the price is steep, me and my boyfriend split one sandwich and each half was pretty big.

The meat slices are really thick and extremely juicy, honestly this place deserves all the hype it gets. They even give you some slices to sample while you wait for them to make your sandwich. Paying is a bit confusing, you pay when you leave but make sure you don't lose your ticket!

- Pastrami

I highly recommend the pastrami! Can't go wrong with it.

Do keep in mind, you can do grab and go [like to go style] and then sit in the back area of the restaurant. There is also the option to dine in and have a server take your order for you and you'll be in the main dining area.

If you choose to order the gran-and-go style, DO NOT, i repeat, DO NOT, lose your ticket that they give you because that is your payment ticket as you leave. You basically eat first then pay as you LEAVE LEAVE.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Definitely a New York institution. Even so, this was my first time here and it was everything I thought it would be. Crowded, crazy, loud, exciting and fun. The 'Cutters' were like artists with their knives. My fellow customers were just as excited as I was to be there and cop one of these legendary sandwiches. I chose the hot pastrami on rye and enjoyed every bit of it. My 'cutter' let me sample the corned beef and I was sorry I didn't get a second sandwich.

No matter when you go, be prepared to wait in line.  Hedge your bet and have a friend stand in another line for a 'cutter'. This will reduce your wait time. I stood in line 4 and my friend stood in line 5 and we both had the same amount of people in front of us but when I reached my 'cutter' he still had two customers in front of him so I just placed his order with my 'cutter'.

The order of ordering goes like this: You are given a ticket by the entrance, go up to one of the cutter and wait for your turn to order, get your food and hand your cutter the ticket, eat, pay at the register, then leave by getting your ticket checked at the exit.

While you are ordering, your cutter will give you a piece of the meat in your order just to taste. Extremely tender beef they serve here, and they serve A LOT!! After half a sandwich, i got the feeling that i ate an entire steak. Food here is a bit salty overall.

I've been going there for 30 years plus and there is an art to ordering and I suggest don't be anxious, stay relaxed and it doesn't hurt to tip generously before they make your sandwich/s.

He ate Half of his corned beef and went back and got a Pastrami Sandwich! They are just that good. But then the bill, 2 waters, 1 beer and 3 sandwiches with tip, over $100... yikes.

Katz's Delicatessen,"This place stays busy, I hear about it all the time but never got around to trying them out until recently because it was my friend's birthday and she wanted to go.

It's mad busy in here, luckily when I arrived there was no line outside and only a 20-minute wait for table service.  The alternative was a wait to order in one of the many sandwich lines and then seat ourselves in the communal seating areas. Oh yeah, there's two big security guards at the door on the way in and out.  One gives you a pink ticket on the way in that gets marked once you've paid for your meal, the other checks to see if said ticket is marked on the way out. Also, don't lose the ticket or it will cost you a pretty penny in fees on the way out.  You could argue with them like I saw a family doing when I came in, but by the looks of the security gaurds, I wouldn't want any smoke with them.

Anyways, the food was fabulous.  The pastrami was amazing. It literally melts in your mouth and was everything with a side of mayonnaise. The matzo ball soup was delicious as well, it was my first time having it and I was impressed. I also dig that this place makes its own lemonade.  Moreover, Katz is pretty pricey but the food and the experience are worth it.

All in all, I can finally say that I've had what she's having and it was absolutely delicious.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Katz's Delicatessen,"After a 45 minute wait (lost track bc I was so hangry) Katz without a doubt lived up to it's hype + some! The pastrami was probably the best pastrami i have ever feasted in.

We got there around 11 on the Sunday following Xmas and man was it packed. Wall to wall ppl waiting in ridiculously long lines. The line system they put in place was a bit chaotic, but we did eventually make it up to the counter. The gentlemen taking our order provided us with corn beef and brisket samples (yum). He recommended we try the two different types of, pastrami and matzo-ball soup.

We got our order and all I can is: I have never in my 37.5  years been wowed by a deli before (the only way to describe the feeling) Definitely worth the long lines!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"If you find yourself craving a New York style deli sandwich and you happen to be in New York then you should already be on your way to Katz's. The line is out the door but the service is fast. The wait is absolutely worth it. If you don't believe me then you should listen to the old Jewish man next to me--he declared ""There's nothing like it! This is the best deli."" And he is absolutely right.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz's Delicatessen since 1888!!!! This Jewish deli came highly recommended by my childhood friend from New York. It has also been the backdrop of many Hollywood movies, such as Meg Ryan's scene from the movie
'When Harry Met Sally.' Remember? ""I'll have what she's having!"" ;-)

Our party of two ordered the Pastrami on Rye. The Pastrami was incredible! So juicy it has to be hand carved by one of the seven Cutters available. I would have preferred the bread to be slightly toasted, but overall it was a great sandwich! I especially loved it with a drizzle of mustard and a sliver of the Half Sour pickle (the lighter green colored pickle). Oh it was scrumptious!! I could eat these crunchy delights all day!!

Hang on to the tickets they give to you upon entering! Then step into one of the lines...grilled items on right...sandwiches in the middle (Cutter 2 - 7)....drinks on the far left. The lines (what lines?!) look like they don't move but you'll eventually get to the counter!

Payment by Credit cards is accepted at the back register. Cash in the front of the house.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz's deli. A staple in NYC. It has stood the test of time with its name and quality of food. If you want the best Pastrami Sandwich in the city Katz is hands down the spot. One mistake people make (unless you don't like sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and Russian dressing) is getting the plain pastrami sandwich. When you go there you have to get there Rueben with Pastrami. I know tradition holds that corn beef should go on a Rueben which is understandable but the Thick Cut Pastrami at Katz is on another level.
Outside of the Rueben with Pastrami, the corn beef is great just not my go to and the brisket is a hidden gem.
Some cons - The waits are long, seating is tough, paying with a card is tedious, the Rueben is pricey but worth it
P.S. When you're at the glass watching them make your sandwich tip when they are looking and they tend to be a little more generous with the portions!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Hands-down the best pastrami in the city, and probably one of the best sandwiches in the world. But, with all of the tourists, it is an absolute nightmare! I have not tried the DeKalb market location... Hopefully the quality is the same.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Hate to do this, but it must be done. This place is the biggest tourist trap in NYC. Seriously. Decided to visit with a friend who was visiting from out of town and honestly wish I would have just taken him to a solid bodega.

From rude staff, to a confusing ordering system - had to go to 5 people to figure out how the hell to order latkes - this place started out with negative stars in my mind. We split a Reuben and an order of latkes. Latkes were flavorless and the Reuben was not as massive or tasty as people have said in the past. I don't know if we got unlucky on an off night or what, but for $20 per sandwich I need it to be a sandwich of the Gods.

Advice - pass and go somewhere else.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"A true landmark. There is a reason why Katz is one of the last standing, original Jewish deli's in the city. It's literally the first stop I make every time I'm in the city.

My go to order is simple. If I'm by myself, it's a Pastrami on Rye with Mustard. If I'm with a friend, we'll split the sandwich and I'll get a hot dog. The pastrami here is not like any other pastrami in the world. It is unbelievably tender, with an excellent balance of fat to lean meat. This pastrami melt's in your mouth. The only downside is the sandwich is $23, however, you're in NYC at one of, if not the, best deli in the country.

Highly recommend Katz. It's a damn good sandwich.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"HIGHLY Highly recommend!   I live in Maui, HI so this was like a ""day in NY"" for us!  We did an order with a selected delivery date.  The carrier held it up for unknown reasons while in route so it got here late; however, even though not all of the items were perished; they gave me a full refund-I was blown away-it was promised by a certain date and they followed through with the promise.  Aside from that; even though a couple of things were slightly stale because of delayed shipping [bagels...etc]; we ate everything and I will be ordering again as a gift for Father's day.  Great traditional delicious deli food and boy was it a treat!  Much Mahalo and Aloha to the Katz's deli staff... it was packed perfectly and I will be making this a regular thing!  Important note:  you should read about how they cure their corned beef and pastrami... it's literally all natural and not injected or pumped with anything to help it cure faster like most places do.  I believe it's cured/aged over 30 days, versus 36 hours.  YOU CAN TOTALLY TASTE THE QUALITY!!!  Try it.... you will love it! [If you don't, I would get to your doctor and see if you have taste buds LOL!!]
Much Aloha from a VERY satisfied and happy customer.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"I would say 3 stars overall, but the meat earns the 4th star.  

Definitely a tourist trap, and if I were local, the pastrami is worth the extra $, as it is, hands down, the best I've ever had.  

How many of us have ever had warm pastrami?!

It's the rest that falls apart.

We sat and waited too long for our waitress to show.  They gave us a SUBSTANTIAL amount of pickles that were WAY too salted to enjoy.  I love fresh pickles but these aren't what you'd expect.  It feels like a huge waste to assume 4 people want a pile of pickles.

The babes enjoyed the roast beef on their sandwich but the bread that came with our sandwiches was not worth the $20+ price of them.

I would recommend splitting a sandwich and seeking out a salad elsewhere to offset the insane pile of meat.  

The latkes were super thick and filling and large (and I enjoyed the flavor), but too cooked for my mom's taste and didn't come with enough sauce and sour cream.

I don't know why NY places are so keen on American cheese but there's enough real cheese available now cheddar should be an option!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"All the buzz about Katz Deli had me excited to try this place. Now that I finally did, I can say it was just okay. This place is pretty iconic and famous since it was featured in 'When Harry Met Sally' movie. They even have the sign pointed to the seat/area where the scene took place. As you walk in the restaurant, you are handed a blue ticket and all the employee said is to keep this ticket with you and you'll need it as you walk out so I assume the ticket is needed to order. There are several stations where you place your order and there is slight confusion because apparently there were separate station for the sandwiches, sides, and drinks. I wish they would explain as soon as you walk the door how the ordering process worked and how the credit card machine is mixed in with the drinks/sides line (not to be confusing at all).

For the food, we ordered the pastrami sandwich with plenty sides of pickle and fries. The sandwich itself was just okay. It was a huge serving but nothing out of this world good. I enjoyed the pickle sides more than I did the sandwich. This establishment pretty much encourages to pay in cash and the prices were pretty expensive. It's cool to say I've been to this iconic restaurant, I don't dislike it but it's not my favorite.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz is extremely delicious! The pastrami doesn't even taste like your typical pastrami it's so fresh and seriously falls apart as you eat it.

When you enter, you are given a ticket to enter and must be used to pay as you exit. Even if you share something and don't order anything, you must present your ticket when you exit or you will be charged a lost ticket fee.

I ordered a pastrami sandwich and completely finished it because it was so delicious. I don't even like mustard but the mustard on these sandwiches is so good and gives it such a delicious flavor!

I'm from California and went to vacation in New York. I'm seriously heart broken with then fact that it will be some time before I'm able to go to this delicious restaurant. Seriously on my list for the 5 best spots I've EVER been to!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Got here just before the Sat tourist lunch rush circa 11:40am. Ordered frankfurters and pastrami on rye to share. My favourite is the Pastrami on Rye. Expensive but worth every cent. Comes with two types of pickles too.. definitely plenty to share between two.

Each adults are given a green ticket each so they can figure out what you have ordered. If you are paying by card then pay at the back corner, right hand side. Cash is taken at the entrance of the restaurant. Green tickets are checked before you exit to make sure you are all settled with all the charges.

People are also given the choice of self service vs. full service tables. I opted for the self service option given it was pretty early and there were tables readily available.

Left just a little bit over 12:30pm and there wasn't a queue outside. Four frankfurters and a pastrami on rye ended up just a tad over $50.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

I had a hard time deciding which sandwich to get because they all looked so delicious, but the security guy was nice to share his favorite is pastrami sandwich so we decided to go with that. They provided some sample for meat at the cutter when you, and the pastrami was so soft, juicy and flavorful. It was the best pastrami I have tried so far. We got our pastrami on rye sandwich with mustard. It was very satisfying to have so much pastrami and the pastrami was so soft and flavorful.

It was very crowded and hard to find a spot to seat. It was like fighting a war to get food here for me but it was very much worthwhile.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Okay, so I made it. We made it by 10:42 and now everything's closed and cleaned?
NOT HAPPY! You could have told me that while I was saying I was on my way to you that everyone was cleaned up and you closed for the night instead of wasting my money and my time. NOT HAPPY. Returning to Las Vegas minus Katz.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

They'll tell you about some of the crazy stories of people losing their tickets if you ask and they have time to chat.  DO NOT LOSE YOUR TICKET!

Food: I make it a point to come to Katz's every time i'm in NYC.  I've even waited in line during lunch on a weekend and I hate waiting in line.  Everyone I've come with also thinks Katz's has the best pastrami hands down.  I love this place so much I was excited to learn they ship and there are subscriptions if you're interested!  I'm totally going to order from them for the holidays! I can't wait!  I actually have never ordered anything else from this place because I love their pastrami so much.  The pastrami isn't salty like other places; it stands on its own with great flavor.  The meat is always very tender and juicy.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  

Definitely worth coming to again and again and again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Katz's Delicatessen,"Honestly, the food was delicious but it did not impress me. Before coming here I obviously knew the price I would be paying for these sandwiches, but after actually having the sandwich, I dont think it justifies the price. Nonetheless, I think Katz's is definitely worth trying just so you can say ""you've been here."" Ahah

Upon entering, the staff gives you a ticket and make sure to hold on to them! Or else youll be charged a ridiculous amount if you loose it. After your butcher makes you your sandwich, the butcher will mark what you got on your ticket for you. Its like a receipt that you show to pay at the end of your meal.

My husband and I got the corn beef and the pastrami sandwich. Both tasted very flavorful and really melts in your mouth. The house-made mustard sauce with it made it even more better.

Overall, great experience. Probably wouldn't be my must go place when visiting New York again, but I'm glad I stopped by. The staffs up front can be pretty rude but the rest of the workers were nice. Fast service when clearing up the table helps a lot because of how busy it can get here.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Lots of selections. I could return many times and try the wide variety of options. Wow. Huge menu.

Had matzo ball soup too. Good.  The pastrami had a wonderful smoke flavor. Wow. They serve a few pickles while you wait.

Katz's Delicatessen,"Came in on a Sunday around 12:30pm, and the line moved quickly. The pastrami was really good, although I remember the last time I was here a few years ago, it was more amazing.. it costs $25 for a sandwich which can easily be split between 2 people, and they give u some pickles. They have old fashion soda (I think it was like $2) it was good.

They give every single person a ticket at the entrance where they write down what each person gets, and as u leave, they read each ticket and charge u as u leave. DONT throw ur ticket away, even if one person pays for everyone's food on one ticket.

There's plenty of extra seating in the back
The seating along the wall is only if ur going to have a waiter serve u.... Mostly, everyone comes in, finds the shortest line and ask for ur sandwich, then find a seat, eat and head towards the exit with ur ticket.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"A historic deli in the heart of the Lower East Side. This delicatessen isn't just an eatery, it's an institution and has remained virtually untouched since 1917, when it opened in its current location (originally opened across the street in 1888). This was an important congregating spot for newly immigrated families in the early 20th century.

Their pastrami is incredible and famous. They cure it for over 30 DAYS and it shows. Tender, melts in your mouth. They always give you a tasting before you buy.

We ordered the pastrami on rye, the corned beef on rye, the cold roast beef, 2 matzah ball soups, and it all comes with a plate of their half and full sours. The pickles are INCREDIBLE and I miss being able to find those crunchy half sours in California.

I'm usually the last person to choose to eat a pastrami sandwich but if it's as good as Katz then I'd eat it everyday if I could. So simple yet so damn good. It's about $20 for a sandwich but so worth it.

Need to know:
1)When you arrive, you will be handed a ticket. This ticket allows you to order, do not lose this ticket or you will have to pay extra.
2)Know what you want before you get to the front. You will get kicked to the back of the line if you reach the front... and locals will laugh.

The hot pastrami sandwich is the go to sandwich. Smoked and juicy pastrami between two slices of bread. It is a delight! Along with the pickles and cucumbers, it makes for the perfect lunch.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants

It's a very spacious spot with lots of seats, AC, and a bathroom, so you'll feel comfortable.

I got the classic hot Pastrami sandwich. The man cutting up the meat for me was nice enough to let me try it without me having to ask. Easily ordered that. The sandwich comes with pickled and cucumber and mustard. The price isn't cheap but it's worth it! Although I wish it came with some sort of sauce cause some parts of the sandwich were pretty dry and the mustard didn't cut it for me for the entire meal (but this dryness is just my personal opinion), it was an amazing sandwich and I can see what the hype is all about.

Katz's Delicatessen,"Let the pitchforks come.  I appreciate that this restaurant is a NY landmark and the price and hype reflect the legacy of pop culture instilled at this restaurant, but from a food and value perspective, their signature sandwich(es) are overpriced.

The pastrami is amazing, hands down the quality of the meat, size of the cut, and way it is prepared is easily the best that I've had.  However, the bread tasted pretty basic, I can only imagine how amazing it would be if the bread was buttered and toasted.

There's a TON of meat inside the sandwich. In fact, I would describe it more like a heap of meat that happens to come with bread than a sandwich. Like I said, just go - the hype is real.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Everyone knows about this place and we heard a ton about this place. We stumbled upon this place after having some bagels over at Russ & Daughters.

But, there were people directing you where to go. The line didn't take too long and we were also given some samples to try the delicious pastrami that they served.

I would say that the pastrami sandwich we had was very very good. For the price you pay for the size of the sandwich, I would say its not really worth it. You are paying about $25 for a small sized pastrami sandwich. The meat was really tender and delicious, but, in my opinion, it was not worth the price.

Katz's Delicatessen,"Might have dreams about this sandwich. We are from Chicago and happened to be a staying a block away. We came across this place on accident (we know it's basically famous) . It's pretty chaotic when you walk in so I'll explain the process:

1) you get a ticket at the door and move up to a cutter - don't lose the ticket
2) order your sandwich - they give you a taste of a sample to make sure you like it (you will, duh). You hand the cutter your ticket and he writes your order
3) go sit and eat . There are some tables reserved for waiter service so you need to choose a table that doesn't say that
4) if you pay cash- you had your ticket to the register at the front. Card, is the back of the inside area

Katz's Delicatessen,"PURCHASED: Brisket on Rye ($24) + swizz cheese ($1.00)
TOTAL: ~$25

PROS:
+ tasty: Certainly tasty--I will give it a 4.3 out of 5 as it pertains to taste. That deli mustard packed into that fat sandwich on some rye bread was delicious.

+ filling: Certainly filling, I ate half of the monstrous sandwich. I was satiated. Finishing the rest of the sandwich was a little bit of work. Though, if you've read my other reviews, you'll know that I have a large stomach capacity.

+ open-24-7: This location is open all day and night.

+ free meat tasting: When you get to the front of the many lines to the long bar of butchers, they'll ask you what you want. You might respond with, ""I'll take the brisket on rye."" The butcher will find the meat, slap it down in front of you on his side of the glass. They'll slice a few pieces off, place it into a cup, and serve it to you while you watch them make your monster 'wich.

+ vegetarian-friendly: They got a lot of stuff. E.g., latkes, knishes, toasted cheese, et cetera

+cultural treasure: Arguably, I would consider Katz's a rich american cultural treasure. The jewish culture of cuisine. It's F****** awesome! If you are from Houston TX you'll know that there is a Katz's there. This Katz's is the original spot. The walls are tall and the wall space is massive. Riddled all over the walls are famous photos of celebrities all over.

CONS:
- price: The price is steep: $24 bucks for a sandwich. Though, you can think of it as $12 for half of the sandwich which is just above a degree of what it should cost. In my opinion, I think it should be no more than $10.

- tipping the butchers: Though, I do like the spot. I don't like the fact that one of the butchers had reportedly tapped the tip jar as my girl friend left with her platter of her sandwich. I do like the idea of good service being rewarded. However, I do not like when it is ""demanded"" or ""suggested.""

IMPRESSION:
Excellent excellent place to take someone who's seeing New York City for the first time. I have said plenty of positive things about this place. It is a sort of one-time visit kind of spot because of the price. I would not go here regularly. Though, if you're hosting friends from out-of-town, you can see yourself come back.

Katz's Delicatessen,"Eating at this restaurant is akin to visiting Elis island for foodies. Its a tourist stop, but not a tourist trap! This restaurant has been around since 1888, serving their famous pastrami sandwich.

THE PASTRAMI SANDWICH (You must get this!)

Really good juicy meat, very salty and fatty - you won't taste this kind of flavor anywhere else. You really should put some mustard all over the meat before you dig in. Goes well with soda. I recommend only getting the half-sandwich as its almost impossible to finish a whole pastrami sandwich.

THE SPLIT PEA SOUP V. MATZO BALL SOUP

The split pea soup is good, but I would recommend the matzo ball soup over it. You can probably make a better split pea soup at home.

THE BRISKET SANDWICH (don't order this)

I don't recommend this one at all. The meat was very dry and the mustard can't save the fact that this meat is just not very good.

THE PICKLES

I love the fact that they give you two kinds of pickles: cucumber like pickles and fermented pickles.

THE SALAD

The dressing actually is pretty tasty and goes well balancing the fattiness of the pastrami sandwich. I recommend it for those of us, like me, who want something fresh to go along with your pastrami sandwich!

SERVICE

This time I got the corned beef on rye this time and it was great.  Tender, salty, and fatty - and plenty of it!  I also ordered a bowl of matzoh ball soup and a creme soda to wash it all down.

The place itself is huge luckily. When you arrive, youre given a ticket and told to start on line. There were 2 people in front of me and i waited maybe 15 min. The workers seem to take their time surprisingly.

The sandwiches range from $20+. Its actually insane. We got a tounge sandwich w mustard on a hero and it was $24! I thought were were gonna be given some family style sized sandwich but its a regular deli size. I truly cant see the prices being justified other than for tourist trap.

I heard the cheesecake is good here too, but I didn't get a chance to have it. The half sandwich was pretty filling on its own.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Over the span of a year I was fortunate to come here three times! Each time was extremely pleasant. I came here twice by myself and a another time with friends so I tried a bit of everything. I highly recommend the pastrami, this one is a no-brainer. It is extremely tender, well salted, and comes out in between two buns and a some mustard. The servers are extremely helpful as well, I gave them a good tip after sampling some of their meats. Another one I liked was the brisket. Very juicy and fatty as well. Expect a line on busy days. They have a big seating area which is first come first serve.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Saw this awesome video on Facebook about some Deli named Katzs'.... flew out from Denver at midnight and ended up here by 10am.

WORTH IT! Hands down the best pastrami my test buds have ever been blessed with.

Now you need to know a few things.. first be quick on your feet, the line starts early and moves fast. Second, keep your ticket with you through the whole meal, and use it to pay afterwards. Lastly, know your order when you get to the counter! These guys don't mess around, they are here to serve you amazing foods quickly!

And if you need some direction ask for a sample slice of some meat and that will make up your mind in a heartbeat",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"I have been wanting to try out Katz's Deli for a very long time but I never made it here in all my visits to New York. I made it a point this time around to book a hotel in the Low East Side so I had no excuse not to go..As soon as I checked into my hotel, I trekked over to Katz's.

I am in awe of restaraunts and establishments that have been around forever. If you read my reviews, you would know that. ;) Katz's Deli was established in 1888 meaning that it has gone through World Wars and the changing of trends through the decades. Great will always be great, so Katz still stands.

I was not sure what to try, the pastrami or the corned beef. I decided on the corned beef and come back for the pastrami. I don't think I could have gone wrong with either but the corned beef was very tender and delicious. The rye bread was packed with thick slices of perfect corned beef. There was a lot of sandwich so I did not order a side. The free dish of kosher pickles were enough as a side item and a great pairing to the sandwiches.

Everything was top here and looking forward to my next visit for that pastrami!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Basics done right. Katz's offers a variety of sandwiches and sides but they're most known for their infamous pastrami sandwich. I came in with a few friends after hours and we were given tickets to track our orders. Whether or not you order food, you'll need to return the ticket at the end or incur a $50 fee.

My friend and I split the gigantic pastrami sandwich on rye, accompanied by complimentary pickles. The sandwich itself is extremely simple, and to be honest, I didn't expect much based on looks purely. Biting into the sandwich, however, I really appreciated the simplicity of it all. The bread is fresh and soft, a great vessel for the tender pastrami. There's extra mustard and ketchup on the tables should you prefer heavier dressing, but I thought the sandwich was excellent by itself.

Although the portions are generous (you can definitely split a sandwich between two people), I felt that it was a bit pricey at $22.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"The food here is undoubtedly amazing here. It's the best I've ever had in my life. But the biggest appeal Katz's has is the nostalgia and the history of the institution.

How it works:
1.walk through the door and get a ticket. The ticket will be used to pay when you leave.
2. Get in line for a cutter. This is where you will order and get your food.
3. Enjoy the delicious food.
4. Give the ticket to the cashier to pay. CASH ONLY",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"This is an unreal experience and I loved it! You could really tell this is a New Yorkers business, the staff got it down, they know what they're doing.

You walk in and there's a crowd of people in front of the meats who are all tasting the meat and ordering. Other people are sitting down at tables already and waiting if they're getting table service. Everyone who comes in also gets a ticket which you will give back to them when you leave.

We sat down and our waitress came up to us and asked us what we wanted. We said we wanted to try out the brisket, tongue, and salami before we ordered. She said the kitchen won't like that we asked for all of that and she thinks the salami is a waste so we just got the brisket and tongue. The brisket had flavor but it was dry and the tongue was ok but this is probably why everyone goes for the pastrami.

Got 2 pastrami sandwiches, some latkes, and the pickled veggies. Those Latkes went well with the applesauce and cream cheese that it comes with. They are a little dense but you dont even notice when they're paired with those condiments. It was a pleasant surprise. Next great surprise was their pickled veggies! Very ironic but I liked the veggies that weren't the pickles the best! I'd say the green tomatoes were the best, 2nd the celery sticks, 3rd the pickles, lastly the cucumbers. I think it's because the pickles seemed overly salty and the cucumbers didn't have much flavor at all. The waitress said she had to dig for those celery sticks so thank you to you girl! They were even a little spicy which is what I like! When we ordered the pastrami sandwiches she said some people want mayo on it but she considers that a sin. One of us got it with mayo and the other one with swiss cheese added. I didn't think it needed mayo but I loved the cheese with it.

Dining experience-wise, this place is loud and crowded. We came by 11 so it was crowded inside but no line out the door yet. By the time we left around noon there was a line out there. New Yorkers work here so be prepared for their attitude and style(it's not personal so don't take it that way). One thing I did have to note was that 15% gratuity wasn't a good enough tip for our waitress, she actually got 30+% but I guess she expected 20% per person. We split our bill between 2 people and each did 15% and then we left some cash on the table as well. But she shook her head when she saw the 15% both times and said sarcastically that she must've been a bitch or done something wrong.

Items we didn't order but I saw are popular were their matzo ball soup, steak fries, and coleslaw.

I'd come back here for the experience and I'll stick to early morning times because that seems to be prime. They have other items I'd try, maybe I'll do breakfast instead of lunch. All I know is I can trust I'll get an authentic NY experience here.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,Went to New York for the first time and a colleague recommended Katz's Delicatessen. They said it was a 'must try'. I say it's a must avoid. This place is clearly a tourist trap and using their length of time being opened as a way to attract customers and also justify their high prices. My Reuben sandwich was overpriced and FLAVORLESS. The meat looked to be high quality too... and still yielded no flavor. I tried covering my sandwich with deli mustard to try and save it.. and still no flavor. Incredibly disappointed with my experience here and will not return during future NY visits. My flavorless sandwich ran me $28!!!! ONE SANDWICH. There was truly nothing special about it and I've had better sandwiches for 1/8 of the price. Stay away and save yourself some disappointment and spare your bank account. You're welcome.,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Visited from CA with the wife and found this place to live up to the hype 100%. Probably the most delicious meal we had in NYC and we went to a bunch of notable places.

Place is crazy busy at all times but they figured out how to make it work via a ticket system and how you line up in front of cutters. It moves quick.

I ordered mine traditional on rye with mustard. My blasphemous wife ordered it on a club roll with mustard, lettuce and onions. It was hot, fatty and melted in your mouth. It was phenomenal. The hype is real. You must go here.

Crushed my sandwich and heard my wife say the nicest thing she's ever said to me: ""I'm full you can finish mine."" Yeah duh, like I was gonna let you throw it away. To be fair, it was still awesome on the club roll with the veggies.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,Wow! Worth the wait and the experience was great. Can't wait to go back and eat more.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Okay, I was a little skeptical. That being said, the sandwiches are legit. We decided to be served. It was worth not waiting in line and trying to find a seat.
Got the Pastrami, the cornbeef Sammie's! The soup was also legit. The food was amazing and the service good. Def a must if your in NY.
I don't have anything bad to say about this place. It's a little pricy, but not bad.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Stop what you are doing and just go here! Get the traditional Pastrami on rye and split it with someone. This is such a meaty sandwich that you are guaranteed to be fully satisfied. You are served pickels and cucumbers on the side and are free with any meal.

Those I'm sure it gets so busy that you can't get a seat HOWEVER every time I've gone, I have been seated within 20 mins.

If you like egg creams, they have a great vanilla and chocolate option.

I've also tried the matza ball soup and its very big, very filling. The broth is pretty tasty as well.

I can not recommend this place enough and is always my go to when friends are in town.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"Katz Deli is a staple of NYC; However you get a small portion (at least with the open faced brisket sandwich). You get two sides with it, I chose macaroni salad and fries. All of the meal was pretty good. My socks were not blown off of my feet but I was happy with the meal. The meals are pretty expensive and I would expect more meat with my meal. Overall, if I wouldn't really return if I was spending my money. It's too expensive, too long of a wait. It's over hyped and under delivered. Once you're seated - Service is pretty good.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"O. M. G. As good as I remember. Haven't been here in 10 years. This is the perfect spot to go to when you are going to splurge and indulge in a yummy pastrami sandwich. The sandwiches are huge and stacked with pastrami. You pretty much have to disassemble the sandwich a little to eat it is stacked so high. A must share. We ordered the fries to share as well.  The pastrami literally melts in your mouth. I'm literally craving it as I think about it.

The have an order system in place where you have to order yourself and find a seat or you are seated and waited on. It's a little confusing and it is always mobbed. It's TOTALLY worth it.

This legendary gem is a must try. You will not be disappointed.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,"After passing it up countless times because of the lines and feeling like it's a tourist trap, finally got to try it. My cousin, who was visiting from out of town, wanted some ""classic nyc food"" and Katz seems to come up on every nyc must-try list. We went around lunch time on a rainy Saturday and fortunately the notorious line was not present. With that being said, the busy-ness that ensued once we opened the door never subsided.

Not really a fan of the whole ticket system that they have since I always lose things.

The deli counter moves pretty efficiently with multiple stations handling orders. I went with the pastrami sandwich and my cousin ordered one of the other sandwiches which I can't remember because it didn't taste that great. The pastrami, on the other hand, was the real deal. Thick, juicy, flavorful pieces of freshly cut pastrami lathered with mustard on rye is a pretty solid sandwich to me. I appreciated the cucumbers and pickles given on the side. I also appreciate that sample of pastrami they give while they're finishing up your order.

Yeah, the sandwich is pricy, but I'd say the pastrami is worth it if you're looking for some standard nyc food and don't mind waiting in a line.

They also have water and bathrooms on hand which is nice since it's always a struggle to find decent ones in the city.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Katz's Delicatessen,This place is legendary. Still dreaming about their pastrami. It's as good as they say. Mouthwatering and delicious. Tender beef and good sides. The food is worth the wait!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"So happy I snuck in a visit to this place before the quarantine. Came by with some out of town friends on a Tuesday around 11:45am. The restaurant was still pretty empty and we didn't have any problems nabbing a table. Love the open feel of this restaurant. There's plenty of space here but I can't imagine how busy this place could get cause the food really is absolutely amazing. Service was very professional and friendly too.

For our meal my friends and I shared the following items:
1) Jonjoli Salad (Georgian salt-fermented blossoms), onions, cucumber, dried sunflower oil: For the most part this is a fairly simple salad. Very clean vibrant veggies, a sprinkle of pomegranate, and a lot of leafy greens. The main unique ingredient is the Jonjoli which has a very unique texture and taste. It has the springy quality of a mushroom but still a vegetal bite overall. There's a floral type of brininess to it too. It reminds me of Chinese pickled veggies that I've had but I can't quite put my finger on it. Personally not an instant favorite but as a salad it was very balanced the a nice complement to other parts of our meal. (4.25/5)

2) Ojaxuri Pork w/ Plum Sauce (Fried potatoes w/ pork, onion, garlic, served w/ plum sauce Tkemali bread): One of my favorite dishes of the meal. The pork was tender and the potatoes were crisp and flavorful. But the real killer was that delicious plum sauce. The dish would get a bit dull without it but with it, I swear I wanted to shovel the whole plate into my mouth then lick the sauce bowl. (5/5)

3) Taste of Georgia Platter: I love that they have this as an option so you get to try a bit of everything. My favorite of the options was the Eggplant and the chickpeas. Some of the flavors were an adjustment but still really enjoyable (4.25/5)
The tray included the following:
-Ekala (Ekala, walnuts, garlic, vinegar, pomegranate)
-Eggplant (Grilled Eggplant, Walnut Paste, Onion, Coriander, Cilantro, molasses, and Georgian Spices)
-Chickpeas
-Beetroot Pkhali
-Spinach
-Regional Cheese
-Bread

4) Beef & Pork Khinkali: I don't have a great comparison point besides Russian/Chinese/etc. dumplings. The filling was good but nothing that super stood out. The skin at the top was a bit thick and doughy for me. (3.75/5)

5) Adjaruli Khachapuri: A fairly dense bread filled w/ butter, cheese, and egg. It's not as cheesy as I imagined. I love the variety of fatty textures against the bread but it's nothing that blew my mind either (4/5)

6) Pelamushi: A grape jelly with a more dense texture. It has a candy-like grape taste w/ the flavor of the peel vs a more fresh grape taste from just the internal portion. (4.25/5)

It's been a while since I had a meal with so many unfamiliar ingredients so it's a bit hard to rate everything. There were some items I didn't enjoy as much but mostly because I wasn't accustomed to the taste or texture. However, as far as I can tell, each item was balanced and well made which is why I'm rounding up. I really want to come back to try out more Georgian food. It's extremely exciting having the opportunity to try a new cuisine and I'm thankful they make it an authentic but approachable experience!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,I'm so glad they still open and do delivery in this period. Everything tastes so good!! I would definitely order more in the future,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"This restaurant is amazing!
Enjoyed everything we've tried so much. Couldn't resist driving from DT Brooklyn several times to order takeout during this madness. Absolutely cannot wait to return and enjoy this delicious cuisine and fantastic wines.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"In preparation for my trip to Georgia (the country), I went on a culinary tour of the city's growing number of restaurants specializing in this thoroughly underrated cuisine. Chama Mama was the best--so good, I went back five times in the span of three months.

Yes, the Adjaruli and other breads will blow your mind. Yes, the roasted mushrooms, khinkali and chikhirtma will make your taste buds sing. Yes, the service is exceptionally friendly. Yes, the decor is minimalist elegance.

But the real, REAL reason to come here is the unique selection of Georgian wines. They're so hard to come by, you should plan to come earlier in the week when they're better stocked. Other Georgian restaurants offer wines from the motherland too, but I like the wine list at Chama Mama best because each offering tells a cool story with lots of great background detail. The servers offer generous tastings to help you select the right one, and when my dining companions have left it up to them to choose, they've always found the right glass.

Fun fact: I call this restaurant Chumbawamba 5/10 times. The number goes up if I've been imbibing Georgian wine.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Oh gosh, I came here over a month ago and I still am dreaming about the cheese bread (Imeruli Khachapuri)! Oogy, gooey, and pillowy -- is there anything better than warm cheese encased in warm dough? Heaven on earth!

We also ordered the Taste of Georgia plate, which came with a variety of different ""dips"" you can also order separately under small cold plates. I am not familiar with Georgian cuisine, but literally could not pick a favorite because they were all so good that the most recent dip by default became a favorite. This plate also came with an interesting smoked cheese that was nothing like anything I've had before -- it had the texture (and smelled a bit) like shoelace, but tasted so uniquely salty and smoky that I kept going for more.

Finally, we shared the cornish hen in garlic cream sauce and this was cooked to perfection as well. The bird was tender and the sauce was great for smothering both the meat and for dipping the side of bread (also freshly baked) into. Definitely one of the best meals I've had in a long time!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Have been dying to try this place since it opened last year.  Am a big fan of Georgian food so could not wait.  Tried the classic adjaruli khachapuri, the ojaxuri pork and the beef megruli kharsho.  Here are my quick thoughts:

Food: (3/5) the pork was great - garlicky, hot, flavorful and a little heavy - goes well with the bread and sour plum sauce on the side (5/5).  The beef cubes with walnut sauce was bland - very single note and I would not get it again (2.5/5).  The khachapuri was also just okay - Oda House in LES and Marani in Queens(best I've had in NYC) are much better.

Ambiance:  nice, new, and clean, a solid 4.5/5.  Also well located and easy to get to.  Much easier than trekking to Queens, Brooklyn, or LES.

Service: also very solid and prompt. We were seated right in the traffic corridor so it was easy to get our waiter's attention (4/5).

Also, try the peach soda.  Not bad and decent value for the size (easily fills two glasses).

Value: 3.5/5 - We ended up spending $75 without alcohol for",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"When you first pass by you cannot tell the size of this place, ambiance is perfectly business or date casual with a hint of what you fancy. The food is good and enjoyably quirky, though smaller than expected for the platters. We took the recommendations from the bartender and everything was so good, specially the cheesy calzone looking bread- yummy!
I love that there's a full bar and espresso machine, so you can just drop by for coffee and dessert if you aren't hungry but would like a space to have a chat.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Reservations are a must, especially on a Saturday night...it easily gets packed. We had a party of 6 and thankfully we did reserve ahead of time and they were accommodating with the cake that we had with us too.  

We had 2 Adjaruli and it was one of the best cheesiest bread ever!!! Megruli Kharsho was mostly stew, and when ordering a bread basket, it only came with two pieces of bread. It was definitely not enough to try with the stew. Pumpkin salad was tasty but I wish it was in a bigger bowl. Ojaxuri pork was amazing but it was very limited in quantity. All the dishes were pretty expensive for the quantity but worth a try.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"This was one of those earth shattering culinary experiences that I live for, and I am so happy I got to try the food here. We didn't make a reservation, which was a pretty ballsy move for a Saturday night in New York City, but came in pretty early (around 5) so they were able to accommodate us at the communal table as long as we left by 6:30. This wasn't clearly communicated to us so we almost thought they didn't have a table at all, but we eventually clarified.

Anyway, I'd previously never had Georgian food, but it had been a bucket list item for a long time, in large part due to videos I've seen of khachapuri. Its visual appeal and flavor did not disappoint, and I was overtaken with the experience. It was so rich and creamy, and the dough was nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They move fast with the prep of it though (the breaking of the yolk and mixing the ingredients) so have your camera ready right away, unlike me. My friend said she deemed this to be her favorite cheese-bread dish ever. We also had pork/beef dumplings (good flavor and really juicy) and cheese dumplings (not my favorite, but this was overshadowed by the other spectacular dishes). Good food overall and it has effectively made want to explore Georgian food further.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"First be aware you will most likely need a reservation after 7pm. My friend and I lucked out because we came at 5:30pm so we were able to sit in a nice area in the back. The hostess, who I think might be the owner was nice and accommodating.

Overall, place is cute and homely. Hostess and wait staff were attentive, nice and great. Food was good.

Price for the portion size is a bit high. We ended up paying $45 per person for 4 smaller dishes to share and 2 lemonades. The lemonades are not really what you expect, it's georgian soda cream in a bottle.

We will be back but probably not order lemonades and order less to be honest.

Overall give it a try!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,"Great little Georgian restaurant in NYC. Super cute inside and a beautiful looking bar with a stone backdrop - huge selection of Georgian wines, both white, red and amber.

Really enjoyed the experience dining here - ordered the cold eggplant dish as an appetizer, which came with some peppers and the cilantro on top definitely served its purpose as a tasty appetizer. Next was the khachipuri po adjarski (open faced cheese bread) and some Khinkali/dumplings. The Khochipuri was delicious and the waiter mixed it right in front. The dumplings were a bit pricey as $11-13 for 3 of them and were a little underwhelming. Would have preferred them to be a bit juicier.

The main dish was beef in a creamy walnut sauce which was delicious and super unique. It was served with grits on the side, which was a little personally unappealing as I'm not a huge grits eater, but overall super enjoyable.

Had the honeycake for dessert with some espresso -- all in all, definitely a memorable meal and would recommend this place!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"I only really write yelp reviews when the food truly moves me to do so. Chama mama should have a line around the corner everyday.
I ordered the Soup Kharcho. It came with soft fresh baked bread. I also ordered the eggplant small plate. This soup I'm eating right now helped me understand what the top chef judges meant when they referred to food as having soul. It's truly one of the best soups I've ever had. It offers just about everything you look for in a soup. When combined with the fresh bread and the eggplant it should be a pantheon NYC food destination. #flavortown",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"That kachapura is as good as it looks! Cheesy center baked into their perfect chewy bread with an egg yolk and butter stirred in at the table. Rip and dip. Mmmm.

I also really liked the Ojaxuri pork with crispy potatoes and onions and lots of coriander richness. It comes out sizzling in it's own clay dish.

We tried the lamb in grape leaves -- not really my thing (most grape leaf dishes aren't for me). We also had mushroom dumplings which are GOOD sized! Lots of standard S&P goodness but probably more than we needed, honestly.

We got a good reco on a big red wine from our server, that had a little smokiness to it. Delish.

I really liked this place. It's cozy, it smells like bread, you can watch the kitchen work, and it was all decorated for Christmas. You can also buy plateware which is fun.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"The food was a 3.5, but the service was pretty abysmal. I went to dinner with two of my friends; we were excited to try Georgian food.

I ordered the adrajuli - regional cheeses in bread topped with egg. Y'all, it was a really great dish - one of my favorites. The cheese was soooooo tasty and it was perfect while it was mixed with the egg.

I also ordered the lamb stuffed grape leaves, and those were tasty as well. For an entree, I tried the Mergruli Kharso which was short ribs with grits. In my opinion, the food fell very short there. The dish was lukewarm at best, and the short rib wasn't as tender as I would like. The sauce it was in had a chalky texture - most likely due to the crushed walnuts. The grits were a grit cake, and it lacked flavor.

I finally ordered the honey cake which tasted like a much better Graham cracker. Once again, I wish it was warmer and/or served a la mode!

Now the service was bad - while our waiter was pleasant when he was there, he was hardly there and not attentive to us but very attentive to other people. We finished eating at 8:30, and we didn't get our check until 9:30!",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"If you're going for dinner -- don't go without a reservation. Lucky for us Yelp users, you can do so via Yelp! I walked in for dinner and ended up waiting for 1.5 hours, as the host kept telling us, she'd ""seat us in 5 minutes."" Other than that hiccup, this place is a great dinner spot and a perfect introduction to Georgian food for people who have never tried it.

The food is a bit on the pricier side, but it's absolutely delicious (and better than some other Georgian spots in the city), making the price worth it. I ordered the Khachapuri which was SO good - the dough here is truly delicious.

Next time, I'd come with a group of people and eat family style, so I can try more food!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Only because we had a reservation, arrived on time for it and so did a few other guests.

The khachapuri was fresh and gooey, with the triumvirate of feta, mozzarella, and ricotta blending into a triumph of rich flavor.  The cheese to bread ratio skewed heavily in the former's favor, as I could've used more to balance the cheeses' saltiness; nonetheless it was still photogenically and gustatorily great.

Chama Mama,"BEST FOOD EVER! I think I had one of the best meals of my life here.

We were able to make a reservation and I'm glad we did because the restaurant is small. Also, we had some people who are from Georgia in our group so they helped us choose the food.

I love red wine so I tried a local Georgian wine- Pheasants Tears and I am in love!

We started with the Adjaruli Kachapuri (cheese bread) and omg it was delicious! Highly recommend trying it and it's definitely shareable. Other things that we tried were Taste of Georgia plate, Chakapuli with Braised lamb and Penovani. Everything was fantastic!

The desserts, I got to try all of them because we shared them, were average but the food was definitely worth every calorie and carb.

I will definitely like to go back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,"Reserved a table for 5 people on a Friday night for my birthday. We all had never tried Georgian food and I passed by here one day and figured, let's try it! Looked aesthetically pretty to the eye from the outside during the day.

My friend got there first and she dealt with a pretty rude employee there. The employee said someone from my party was here already so my friend asked who? And the lady gave her an attitude. Not a good start to the dinner but whatever. We got seated once 4 out of 5 of us where there and the waiter recommended to us the dishes we should try. Now, we were waiting on the last person from my party to arrive and the waiter kept hovering and asking us if we were ready. LIKE SLOW YOUR ROLL. We will flag you down when we are ready, geez.

Onto the food, we ordered the ADJARULI (cheese boat), KHINKALI ( beef/pork and mushroom dumplings), meat platter, and ""OJAXURI"" MUSHROOM. Everything tasted pretty good but my faves was Ojaxuri mushroom and meat platter! It had the most flavor although the meat platter got a bit salty. The dumplings were just meh. Could get better dumplings at an Asian place (sorry!) Cheese boat was really good too but it is cheese and bread. If you eff that up, then that's just sad.

Overall, I wouldn't come back here just because it wasn't all that much of a great experience. I just felt like we were judged bc we were an Asian group and the situation prior to getting our food. The food also was OK.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"When I heard that a new Georgian restaurant opened up I was super excited to try it out. One of my really good friends is Georgian and my sister lives in a very Georgian neighborhood and I've always been obsessed with their bread. I've had Georgian food at Supra before which is located in DC and I instantly fell in love.

Coming to Chama Mama, you're instantly taken back by the huge stone oven that sits in the kitchen. Apparently that's where they make their amazing bread. We made reservations for 4 and it was fairly smooth and fast. The waiter that served us was extremely nice, attentive and very knowledgeable in the dishes and drinks. We ordered the veggie platter which featured a collection of Georgian dishes, their cheese/egg bread, an assorted skewer platter, another eggplant and their honey cake.

Everything was extremely delicious and the bread was so soft and yummy, it literally felt like it was melting in our mouths. I could literally eat all of their dishes on a daily basis because of how fresh, filling and flavorful it was. The honey cake was absolutely perfection and tasted like tiramisu and baklava in one.

I highly highly recommend coming here and it will definitely be one of my go to places in the area.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"I visited here with a few coworkers and was excited to try their signature dish (cheese bread with egg) after seeing it on Instagram. This dish was fine but does not warrant a trip to this restaurant as all the other dishes we tried were just average to not very good. The other dishes ordered were the eggplant, mushrooms, oxajuri pork.

We ordered all of the desserts except the honeyed walnuts and all were mediocre and not worth the calories.

Service was not very friendly and seemed slightly annoyed with us throughout the entire dinner. I wouldn't eat here again and would likely steer others to eat somewhere else if asked.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Second time having Georgian food and best of all its better than I remember. My party of three ordered the following:
- Megruli kharsho (beef with walnut sauce): fresh take on a sauce, but beef was hard and slightly over cooked.
- Adjaruli Khachapuri (cheese bread with egg): must order.
- Lamb Khinkali (dumpling). The dumpling filling is so moist and juicy, wished the order didn't come only in 3s",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"OMG I am in love. My parents were in town and I wanted to take them somewhere unique so of course I turned to yelp. I discovered Chama Mama and since none of us had tried Georgian food before I decided to give it a go. We made a reservation the day before and had no trouble.

The place itself has a super trendy yet chill/casual vibe. There is a giant glass window looking into the kitchen which was cool. The servers were all extremely attentive and helpful!

In terms of food, we started with A Taste of Georgia, which I HIGHLY recommend. Soo yummy with a number of vegetarian dishes, cheeses, spreads and bread. Next, we had the beef and pork Khinkali (dumplings) which were pretty good but I wouldn't get them again. We also had the adjaruli, which seemed to be the thing to get here. It was yummy! Cheesy, buttery and delicious. We also each ordered the wine sampler which I recommend! All 3 wines were great. They had a number of desserts not on the menu and we grape jelly-type pie which was very unique and refreshing and not heavy like many desserts.

Overall, I highly recommend checking out Chama Mama if you are looking for a unique dining experience! Not only is the food, service and ambiance great, but the prices are also pretty reasonable! I will definitely be back to try other menu items.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Nice ambiance and setting. We ordered and shared the adjaruli khatchapuri, lobio, and cheese khinkali (dumplings). The cheese boat was a little crispier than my taste, I like it when it's doughey. The lobio was very good, but the khinkali filling was just too runny and too buttery. The highlight was probably the medoki (honey cake) for dessert, which was very good. I took off another star because service was kinda slow and inattentive, even though there were barely any other people at the restaurant at 5 pm.

Not sure I'd come back since there are other Georgian places in the area.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Chama Mama

OVERALL: 7.1/10

This restaurant would have gotten a way higher review if the prices were a little lower.

The pork dish which is the last picture, in a tiny bowl, maybe with less than 10 pieces of pork ran for about $20.

All the other dishes were pretty good in my opinion besides the grits with mint, that didn't have much taste.

The expensive pork dish was really good, but in my opinion not worth it due to the price.

The set up of the place is really elegant, and service seems to be pretty good.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"clean, spacious and special place with very attentive services. For cold appetizers- would recommend the taste of Georgia, which has everything. I like the stuffed eggplants and cheese. Dumplings are recommended, but for me, it's kinda of pricey for $3 a piece of dumpling. The wine is good and cheap, I would recommend the wine flight for 3 small glasses for $10.

The boat cheese with butter is another must. The Georgian bread is baked very differently in the house and it goes so well with the melting cheese.  It's the best thing in the house. It looks heavy but it's definitely less than a piece of cheesecake.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Came here last weekend with a friend and the three stars is mostly for the service. Our waiter was super sweet and attentive. Maybe it was what we ordered and the combination but the overall meal was a little disappointing.
We ordered:
1. The soup dumpling with pork and beef- this was okay, Chinese soup dumpling is definitely more superior than these. The filling was a little dry and the dumpling wrappers were way too thick. The wrappers were also a bit salty so it kinda taste like pasta. Overall not a huge fan of these dumplings. $11 for 3 dumplings.
2. Shkmeruli-Chicken in creamy sauce. This was really heavy in my opinion. The chicken was tasty but not for $22.
3. Abjaruli-The famous bread boat with cheese, egg and butter. The look of it was very cute but like most of the other food here it was a little salty and bland. Also pricey for bread and cheese, $15.

Overall, the food here was okay. I think the food is expensive for what you get. Also I do not recommend getting the creamy chicken if you get the cheese bread boat. It was way too heavy! I'm glad I got to try Georgian food but don't think I'll come back.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"What a great discovery! We've past this place many times over the past year, but didn't have any desire to check it out until a week or so ago when the restrictions began to allow outdoor seating, and we passed by and witnessed a customer sitting outside eating an egg dish that looked spectacular! We decided to check it out the next day!
We looked at the menu and it mentioned the cooking was from ""Georgia"". We saw grits on the menu and assumed it was Southern American fare. LOL. Very embarrassed but thrilled to discover it was Georgian food. From the country! All of a sudden our brunch turned into an even more exciting adventure!
From the minute we showed up. We realized that Mariam was the best server on the planet! She not only showed us around the deceivingly large and beautiful restaurant, complete with a beautiful back garden, but took the time to explain every item on the menu as well as all of their specialty cocktails made with delicious fruit grappa's.
We enjoyed the glorious Penovani Khachapuri, the Imeruli Khachapuri and the delightful beef and pork Khinkali soup dumplings.
The food was above and beyond our expectations. We will for certain be back and bring friends.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"A friend from Georgia took me here for my first Georgian meal! It was a delightful meal - very delicious and authentic dishes. The staff was very polite. The interior is clean and well-decorated.

It is a bit loud so something to keep in mind if you want to have some conversation in your party of people. I had asked the waiter to turn down the loud music which they were very kind and responsive to. It was still a bit loud - maybe because we were seated in the large table with another party.

Overall, clean place, great service and delicious, authentic Georgian food!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Disclaimer- make reservations on yelp. Yes the day before it probably looks like oh wow everything's available but trust me- make them. Long story short the day of you will quickly see reservations disappearing VERY quickly so definitely save yourself the trouble of having to wait for a table and make them! It takes five seconds after all :). They were kind enough to hold a table for us but we had to leave by 8:30 which was completely reasonable considering we were half an hour late and were grateful that they did hold our table as it was very busy (and on a Friday night at that). For starters we got the Imeruli Khachapuri and the Taste of Georgia. The khachapuri is to die for. Get it, you won't regret it. The Taste of Georgia, however, was nothing special and definitely not worth $24 IMHO. Out of all of the dips, only the eggplant one stood out to me so if I were to return back here (which I totally would since out of the four dishes we tried, the only dish I didn't like was the Taste of Georgia), I would definitely get the eggplant as a starter instead. As for our mains, my friend got the Lobio and I got the Ojaxuri Pork. Both dishes were wonderful and definitely reasonably portioned. The only thing my friend said about the Lobio was that typically the fermented vegetables on the side are mixed in with the stew but it didn't seem to be a dealbreaker for him. I loved the Ojaxuri Pork and would love to return back to try the Ojaxuri Mushroom. It was super flavorful and the pomegranates were a nice touch. All in all, Chama Mama is a great place to give Georgian food a try IMHO.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"I spent a year in Georgia  and can attest that the food at Chama Mama is the real deal. I ordered four Georgian staples and split with my friend, we got:
- Badrijani: Thin sliced eggplant with a walnut spread, rolled up and topped with pomegranate seeds. You get 3 pieces in an order.
- Lobio: Flavored bean dish, served with a dense cornmeal bread
- Khinkali: Dumplings filled with seasoned beef and pork mix, and broth. You get 3 dumplings in an order.
- Adjaruli Khatchapuri: ""Cheese boat"", imagine pizza dough filled/topped with ooey-gooey cheese and an egg.

All of these were the real deal. My only criticism is that I thought the price of Khinkali and badrijani were steap for the small portion size. I loved the restaurant look and feel though, and the nice bartender who let me practice my Georgian. :) Highly recommend if you're in the area.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Went back here the other night and realized you basically can't deviate from the three dishes mentioned in my previous review as must-gets. It stinks cause I was excited about this place! We ended up paying over $75 for a meal that wasn't good which, in a city with incredible places, both cheap and expensive, doesn't cut it.

While the sautéed mushrooms with garlic were delicious, we also tried the beef short ribs stew entree with grits and the mushroom soup entree, and that's where things took a turn.

Had to send back the mushroom soup, and the beef short ribs stew was served cold. The grits have an odd consistency. We didn't eat much of this or this puff pastry with cheese either. Like a bad quesadilla. No good.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"This is a new nice modern looking Georgian place right nearby 14th and 7th. They've been open for a bit over 2 weeks as per this review. They currently do not have a takeout menu but they can prepare things to go as I heard when one of the waiters was helping someone else who was ordering kinkali (Georgian dumplings similar to Russian pelmini albeit fatter though these had cheese/nuts.) Anyway, I've had Georgian food before (there's a local place in my hometown and I've been to some Russian places with Georgian dishes) and I stopped in here as I am usually in this area on Monday. The wait staff, at least at the bar, were highly professional and accommodating and made great recommendations to some of the other people there.

They have a wide selection of Georgian wines both by the bottle and the glass including something I do not know much about known as amber wines, or qvevri/kvevri. It's a type of aged wine and if you are curious, it's a dry wine with a strong aromatic/floral flavor. The one I had in particular reminded me of a drier gewurtztraminer. I tried ordering one of the wines from here but they were out but the waiter gave me a glass of their vine ponte mtsvane for the same price (which is usually just a bottle.) Very nice waitstaff as noted.

I ordered the mixed mushrooms which were roasted with some parsley and chopped into small pieces. The mushrooms were excellent but maybe too finely chopped as some pieces were a bit hard to eat with a fork. One of the waitresses gave me a piece of their home bread which I believe was shoti; a whole wheat loaf similar to a pide to have with the mushrooms which was excellent as well and just as good as my local place.

Short review as I only had an appetizer and one of their very unique wines. Excellent place. I'll stick with a 5 for now as all I had so far is good and the staff was very nice. I'll be back for their adjaruli khachapuri (which everyone was ordering)/meat dishes as that's what Georgia is more well known for.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Adding extra star for outstanding customer service after the meal experience.  

Literally top 5 worst food experiences. Not sure why all the rave reviews. Here is a photo of our $28 ""taste of geogia"" signature dish as part of our delivery.  Instead of the beautiful spread you see in all the photos,  we got a few measly balls of veggies and about an ounce of soft cheese.  We also ordered the dumplings - lamb and pork. Not only were they incredibly salty but I couldn't tell the difference.  

Only reason why  giving two stars instead of one is because of the kind lady I spoke to when I called to let them know how disappointed I was.  She really did try and fix things.  

It was a ruined Sunday evening dinner.  And the taste was so bad we wouldn't eat the food again even for free.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Great restaurant which makes a great introductory to georgian food. Very clean, modernly decorated with tables fit for any parties with an open kitchen that shows breads being baked and food being prepared. The restaurant is not cheap due to its location and portions aren't too big. Service is excellent as well. The menu has pictures of the most famous Georgian signature items which definitely helps.

Food is really good but on the saltier side. Definitely get the taste of geogia which has spreads of vegetables and beans with bread. Khinkali is also a must. It's basically dumplings that looks like xia long bao but a little bigger. I found the skin to be a bit thick and fillings we ordered to be extremely salty. Lastly, another must is the soup bowl looking bread with egg and cheese and the wait staff mixes it with butter. Can't go wrong with that combination. Ironically, this entree wasn't salty at all. Bread was so warm and went perfectly with butter, egg and cheese. We also tried the beef entree with walnut sauce which had some spices I didn't like but everything else we got didn't have strong smell or spices.

What I've learned is that Georgian is very heavy on bread, cheese, butter and rooted vegetables. I'd like to be back to try other types of dumplings and mushroom dishes.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Chama Mama offers a tapas like experience for Georgian cuisine. The menu is separated into categories: doughy items like their delicious khachapuri ajaruli, kvali, and khinkali; small cold plates (recommend the pumpkin pkhali, which is sort of akin to a pesto or paté); small hot plates (recommend the elarji, because the texture of the grits is excellent); soups and salads, including the wonderfully unique jonjoli which is sharp and herbal; and shared plates that are mostly meat skewers or stews and also includes lobio, which is one of my favorites.

They also have a desert menu which has a good offering of both familiar and traditional desserts.

A large selection of wine is available and if you're unfamiliar with Georgian varietals or the process of making wine in a q'vevri, the staff is more than happy to assist. They also offer ch'ach'a, which is a distilled spirit like grappa, which I highly recommend if you're into spirits. They're the first place I've seen try and use it in cocktails as well (I've a suspicion it would be great with the nuclear green tarragon soda they offer).

The one thing I'm sad about is that for a while they'd listed a type of khinkali with cheese and hazelnuts as a filling, but they'd had to stop making it before I was able to try them - but they offer more than enough to make up for that.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Had dinner here when in NYC a couple week ago.  I have never had Georgian food prior to this, but after such a great experience we are sure to have it again in the future.

I don't recall the name of the green soup that we had, but it's base was spinach and it tasted absolutely delicious.  The khinkali dumplings were quite good as was the ekala.

The roasted mushrooms were fine, as was our order of kebab wrapped in a lavash like bread;  but, these last two items didn't stand out as anything special, and thus I'd recommend trying other items on their menu.

Very good service, and a very pleasant atmosphere, although a bit on the loud side.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"I came here with a group of friends for my birthday. We had selected this restaurant because one of our friends is Georgian and would be able to order the appropriate foods, not that the offer was needed because the menu and place is very English friendly. The service is very friendly and helpful with the menu.

We ordered a slew of dishes in addition to a couple of Georgian wines that were delicious and very strong. I don't quite remember the names of what we ordered, but they were all delicious. The cheese dumplings were phenomenal, the beef dumplings were equally as good. They were buttery and the dough was amazing. The bread bowl with cheese and egg is a DEFINITE MUST HAVE. If anything order this -- it's delicious and tastes exactly like melted buttery popcorn.

Overall, I will be back for the service and amazing food. The ambiance was very clean, neat, and bright. One star off because the food did take a really long time to come out, but perhaps that's because of the love and care bestowed on the food.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

I called in advance to book a reservation and they had the area ready for us on time. Although some of the guest arrived late, they still seated the ones who arrived on time.
The server recommended a wine and she also recommended the food. When we placed the order and said it would be shared, she portioned it out and brought it to us which was great.
Everything we got was good. The chicken was cooked well, tender and flavorful. The braised lab soup was delicious with the right amount of Spices. And the cheese bread with butter was great.
When you put the service, the food and the price together, this place is a must try. Even with a party of nine the bill was not precharge with a tip. Highly recommend.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Having traveled to Georgia, I was ecstatic to find a traditional Georgian restaurant. While there's a modern twist to some of the dishes, they still have the classics in their traditional an delicious glory: Khinkali and Khachapuri. In addition to the food, which was true to its classic form, they carry an abundance of Georgian wines. You can't go wrong with any of the wine from Pheasants Tears. (One of the favorite restaurants of the late great Anthony Bourdain.) If you want to have an authentic Georgian experience, grab some amber Qvevri wine, Adjaruli Khachapuri, and Khinkali...and remember never to eat the stem!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,"I had Georgian food only once before so when I saw this modern tapas style restaurant, I was eager to use it as a meeting place for a ladies night on a what I thought would be a quiet evening. I got there around 6ish and was right away asked if I had a reservation. I did not and was told we could be seated only if I promised to be done within the hour. We agreed and we sat in the back of the first room, overlooking  the plexiglass where you can actually look through  to the kitchen.  Ambiance was modern  and cheek, waitstaff was polite- even when asking us to give up our table soon after the check. It was indeed very very crowded. I was with two women who only wanted vegetarian that night and I have to say everything was delicious - most of the vegstrian options involve mushroom which I love so no complaints. I highly recommend the dumplings. My friend ordered the creamed vegatavle soup and loved it. My friend and I got the sour cherry compote which was delicious. My other friend ordered the tamerind lemonde but was disapponted to learn it was soda.

Chama Mama,"We were specifically looking for a Georgian restaurant in Manhattan and found this place. It looks small when you enter, but actually it has additional seating in the back, so don't worry too much. I'm sure it gets busy for dinner though.
The interior is very modern and cozy. The menu is not huge, but has almost everything you might want. The food was great. I was there mostly for the khachapuri and it didn't disappoint! What disappoint me was the service. It was slow and it looked like the waiters were very tired. Remember I came there for the khachapuri? They totally forgot about it (they never told us that, but it was obvious they sent the order to the kitchen only when I asked the server how much more time I needed to wait for it).

We ordered to share and tried a variety of the vegetarian options (which they had plenty of). My favorite was the Imeruli Cheese Bread. The Mushroom Chakapuli was good, but not particularly special and I would probably skip it in favor of more small plates

The main downside was the service. Our server brought us an incorrect dish. No problem, mistakes happen, but it took almost 20min for us to wave down a server to correct the issue. It took a similarly long time to correct our bill, which listed the same incorrect dish. All of the staff were very friendly and gave good recommendations.

The lamb is also great as well.  The wine is excellent, we had traditional Georgian amber and red wine.  The red wine was called ""Pheasant's Tears"" and was great.  I've had a lot of different foods in my past and this is nothing like I've had recently.  Good to get a fresh new cuisine on the scene.

Chama Mama,"This is my 2nd time coming here; this time I was with someone who was actually from Russia so she was able to compare to traditional Russian and Georgian dishes she had while growing up. Apparently, this stuff was not only delicious but verrrry on point!

Penovani--rich, buttery, cheesy, flaky goodness. All you need to know.

Stuffed eggplant (from cold plates section). So much flavor packed into 3 little mini eggplant roll ups. We ordered to share but if I knew they were so small and so good, we would've probably gotten 2 orders!

Apkhazura--if you're a meat lover, this dish'll definitely do the trick! The cheesey grits/mashed potatoes get an A+ as far as comfort foods go.  

Honey cake--rich and decadent but a bit too sweet. Even for someone with a massive sweet tooth like me!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Yum!!! We are vegetarian and had no problem. Taste of Georgia is wonderful (the walnut jam with the homemade feta is fire), the bean stew is hearty and pretty yum (but not the most unique item on the menu), dumplings are pretty good (cheese heavy, but I honestly wasn't able to taste the hazelnut). Might be a bit harder to be vegan here, almost all of our items had cheese. We over ordered (three dishes above plus a $30 bottle of wine) and it came out to 90 with tip for two. The decor is nice (and it's cool you can watch people making food!), service is exceptional, and the food was yum. I recommend this spot!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Super cute dinner spot in Chelsea - came here for dinner with a friend, and really appreciated how every design detail in the space was well thought-out. Really cute, Instagrammable spot.

We ordered a bunch of cold and hot appetizers, and then main dishes as entrees. We liked the app's the best - the dumplings were soo good, and we ordered the stuffed flaky-dough cheese bread (forgetting what it's called). I ordered the Georgian meatballs / sausages, and it was super tasty.

Only thing I'll say as a warning to other is that the menu is pretty limited to  cheese and bread, haha. There are few healthy options, and pretty much everything has butter/cheese on it. It's super RICH, which I was totally in the mood for, but I wouldn't bring someone with allergies, or a health-nut to this place. If you're neither, ENJOY - this place is awesome!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"I love NYC because of places like Chama Mama. Seriously, where else in the U.S. (and probably world, tbh) are you going to be able to have Georgian food (and not talking about ATL here- think Central Asian here) on a random weeknight?

In any case, off to the races. This palce is relatively new so there were definitely some early stage jitters in terms of service. Also the restaurant seat/table placement feels sorta willy-nilly. They'd do well to invest in a bit of restaurant interior design consulting. But the food- the important part- doesn't need any consulting.

What you must have here is the cheese bread. I know you're thinking you should skip the calories. But you're stupid- stop listening to yourself. Get one or all of the breads.

Other standouts- excellent dumplings and lamb in grape leaf starters. You must try the hen as a main- it's oh so good...

The one thing you can miss: the short rib. The reason I'm not a short rib fan is because of dishes like this one.

Great weeknight dinner... and try some of that Georgian wine while you're at it. Not bad at all. Gotta love NYC...",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Have to say that I didn't expect much from this place, just because of terrible experience at other Georgian restaurants in town, but Chama Mama definitely deserves 5 stars! We ordered beef and pork khinkali, khachapuri, taste of Georgia platter and meat platter. Every dish was spot on!
We went on a Friday night and there was a line outside, yet still service and food were at great speed.
My only recommendation would be to maybe have some light Georgian music on the background just to make the atmosphere more complete.
But anyway, everything was great and looking forward to come again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Wow, this place is awesome! I came here with two other friends for dinner on Friday, and we arrived around 5:45PM. The place was still pretty empty when we got there so we got seated right away and handed some menus.
Our waitress came by our table to take our order, and we instead asked for recommendations. She gave us a lot of recommendations, and then we ended up ordering:
Taste of Georgia (beetroot pkhali, ekala, spinach, eggplant, chickpeas, cheese, and bread) - this plate was quite small, and each blob could have done with more flavor. I really liked the eggplant and the cheese, and I thought both were delicious. The other ones were just average though, not a super big fan of them.
Adjaruli Khachapuri (traditional boat-shaped cheese and egg bread) - this came with a wrapped piece of butter, and I don't like having so much butter in my food so I requested not having it. But, apparently the bread isn't good without it, so we ended up putting about half of it in. The bread was really soft, and the cheese was really tasty. There was more cheese than bread, but I really enjoyed it.
Kubdari (pastry with spiced beef, pork, and spices) - This was by far the most delicious item we ordered, as the pastry was flaky and slightly crunchy, and the inside was juicy and really flavorful. We all greatly enjoyed this dish.
Khinkali (beef and pork dumplings as well as lamb dumplings) - The dough was chewy and there wasn't too much soup inside the dumplings, but it was super flavorful. I really enjoyed this dish as well.
Lobiani (pastry with mashed beans) - We originally didn't order this, but we got it since we could still fit more into our stomachs. The beans were really soft and mashed, and it had a slight spicy kick to it. Flavor was great!

In general, the dishes we had were all really flavorful and delicious (aside from the Taste of Georgia platter), and this is the best meal I've had in a while. Service was also really good as the waitress was super friendly and came back to check up on us, cleared our finished plates appropriately. Ambiance is comfortable and tidy, not too loud, great for conversations. The entire experience was great, but it was also slightly pricey at around $108 post-tax (we ordered more than we should have, but still). I would definitely come back and highly recommend it! Come with a group of friends or other people though because there are so many good dishes to try!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Hip place to try Georgian food - like working all the trendy vibes. Food is delicious although lacking in veggie options. Try the kachapuri for an authentic experience as they whip it up right in front of you before you can devour it. The wines are amazing - the amber color is disorienting but delicious. After traveling to Georgia a few months ago I'd say the food is fairly accurate and authentic. Just give me all those breads, cheeses, and wines. It's the France of the the Caucasus'. Service was great - our server even did a dreaded shot of chacha with us.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Finally, a restaurant dedicated to #georgiancuisine in Manhattan, and it is legit! The best part? georgian wine - qvevri , named after the large egg-shape vessel where the wine is storage, fermented and aged.

Popped in on a recent Friday and parked myself at the bar right away. Sticking with my ketodiet , I decided to skip the infamous khachapuri aka cheese in a bread boat :( if you come with 2+ def order it!  

Of course there are other interesting items to try! Chakapuli with braisedlamb: savory and  packed with tarragon aroma, tho a bit saltier than I like. I can see myself sipping this soup in colder weather like bone broth.

Favorite were the roasted mixed mushrooms including cremini oystermushrooms #shitakemushrooms and white buttons. umamibomb ! The stuffed eggplant  with walnut and corriander , seasoned with garlic and red wine vinegar , had a complex flavor profile albeit the unassuming appearance. It was nutty, creamy , subtlely sweet all at once. Wash them down with some tannic qvevri. If you are a Georgian wine newbie like me, def give it a shot.

Hosts and wait staff were friendly and helpful in recommending wines. Food is high quality and reasonably priced for this neighborhood. Perfect for a casual date or friends catching up .

I will be back!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Off the bed I'm gonna SOUND biased because I am from GEorgia but I can easiily say it's THE BEST GEORGIAN restaurant in NYC! I love dining there for many reasons: food, ambiance, service- honestly I recommend it to couples, groups, birthdays and or retry much  any occasion works with this place where you get the taste the most authentic foods  delivered in its best form!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Chama Mama is a great addition to 14th street! My boyfriend and I walked in on a weeknight for dinner and were seated eight away. We shared the Simple Salad, Chvishtari, Khinkali (Beef + Pork Blend), Adjaruli and Medoki for dessert. Everything was delicious, with the standouts being the cheese boat, dumplings and dessert. Only thing I wouldn't get again was the chvishtari, which wasn't as cheesy as I'd been hoping (it's described as ""fried cheese"" on the menu but is really more of a bread that's slightly cheese-flavored).",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Wait time: 2/5
I thought that it would be very crowded around dinner time (7:00) so I made a reservation in advance. I'm very used to being seated ASAP when I make reservations but Chama Mama did not seat me until five minutes after my reservation time! I also got there five minutes earlier so I was awkwardly standing for a whole ten minutes even though I made a reservation.

Service: 2.5/5
I feel like Chama Mama is either extremely understaffed or have inexperienced servers because when we got to our table, one of my friends only had a napkin, and the other had nothing at all! I had to grab a nearby set of cutlery for my friends lol.

Food: 4/5
The only redeeming part of this review is the food! We got two share plates (Megruli Kharsho, and the Apkhazura) and the Taste of Georgia. As a cheese lover I absolutely enjoyed the cheeses provided in the Taste of Georgia. The salty cheeses go so well with the jam! I only with it came with more bread. The Megruli Kharsho was a little dry but the Apkhazura was SO good! Highly recommend the Apkhazura. Part of me wishes that there was more meat in the Apkhazura because it was so delicious. Perfect combo of sweet, smoky, and salty! The food gets 4 stars because I feel like it's still a bit overpriced for the amount that they serve.

I wish I could give this place at least four stars but the service and the price really turned me off. Great food, but maybe I just went on a bad day where a ton of people took the day off.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,"Wait time was 45 min, although we had reservation, manager (young lady)  was rude , walking around the restaurant with a glass of wine and smelling terrible like a cigaret. She insisted to add to our table with party of 10 anther 2 people.
20% gratuity was added without our knowledge and feels very high for a service we got.
Food was great, recommend to hire professional management.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Overall I had a lackluster time eating here,  and was not impressed with the  prices. I couldn't find everything I wanted and each dish was fairly pricey, especially for a restaurant that mostly caters to students. The staff was not unfriendly but not very warm, although some of the waiters are just talking on their phones. Another downside is that the menu seems to change often, as when you leave you might want to get something different (my friend was told that there was  soup but it's actually something else included in the Georgian sampler). I will say the food is really tasty but the portions were not adequate.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Delicious food, fantastic wine varieties, and great service. It's such a homey yet refined presentation of Georgian food. Love this restaurant and will return many times.

The ambiance is fantastic as well, a pleasure to be in this space.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"The best Georgian restaurant in NYC so far!

Great customer service! Clean! Delicious! Nice and friendly environment!
For me as a Georgian person it is a huge responsibility to introduce my culture to others. This place helps you in this and justifies the expectations.

Great place for vegetarians. All Georgian appetizers are vegetarian and super delicious.

The wine? Fantastic Georgian wine!
I recommend Vine Ponto!

Totally recommend this place!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Terrible customer service - patronizing and unprofessional.
We called in advance and made a reservation for two. Traveling over 40+ minutes in the NYC November cold to get to the restaurant, we arrived early and excited for our reserved 6:30PM time slot. Upon checking in, with whom claimed to be the owner, we were told in the most condescending tone that our reservation is not in their system. We politely asked for them to check with the individual whom was making phone reservations, but were told they do not know who was answering the phone that afternoon - troubling to hear from the individual who identified themself to be the owner of the establishment.

We are reasonable and flexible people, this situation would have been no big deal had the demeanor and tone of voice of the alleged management of the restaurant been at least slightly respectful. Instead we were spoken to in a highly derogatory and disrespectful manor and told we must have not made a reservation. The poor management of your employees and inability to identify who was taking reservations is by no means an excuse to call your customers liars. I cannot vouch for the food, as we obviously were never seated - but can with confidence say I will not be returning. I've received better customer service at a gas station.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

I would also recommend the ""mtsvane"" wine.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"The interior is very aesthetic and spacious! The food was amazing too! We got the adjaruli (cheese bread) and apkhazura which were amazing. I would highly recommend the adjaruli for the cheesiness, definitely can't go back to regular cheese boats!

Chama Mama,"We were walking the highline this autumn and wanted to eat somewhere close to union square and this was appealing. We were pleased with the food - the cheesy bread was yummy and so were the dumplings at reasonable prices. But the service was slow to nonexistent. They are friendly and pleasant but woefully understaffed and so you have to keep waiting for them to take order, serve your drinks, serve your food, give you the bill etc.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,"I never had Georgian food, but went here with two other friends and had a great time.

I don't always love the ""shared plate"" idea, but it works very nicely here. The plate with the different bread, flatbread, hummus, spreads, and cheese was definitely worth sharing, as was the iconic Khachapuri.

The smoked twirly cheese (korboce?) was out of this world and tasted like a campfire -- in the best of ways. Not sure if I can go and buy this deli-style, but I would for sure.

The waiter and another nice lady -- perhaps the owner -- were very helpful in giving recommendations and making sure we were happy.

Would recommend to anyone looking for something new. It might be a bad description, but I might call Georgian food somewhere in-between Greek and Middle Eastern food, so if you like either of those, you will probably be happy.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Considering the location, this place was really quiet. I appreciate a place where I could actually hold a conversation with a group of friends. You cannot go wrong with The Taste of Georgia board that came with an assorted side dishes. The cheese boat was really heavy, so make sure you have a group to share it with. The dumplings were nothing exceptional. Overall, the service was quick, beautiful location and food was above average.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

I absolutely loved my experience here- from the moment I walked in the staff were so warm and welcoming and the space was really cute. It smelled like the amazing kiln bread that they feaure. The hostess took the time to explain the menu to us and what we ended up ordering was incredible, every. single. dish. The highlights included the cheese bread (Adjaruli) and most of all the Honey Cake dessert. INSANE. Definitely get the honey cake.

Chama Mama,"Let me first say, that I have only had Georgian food once before coming here so it is possible this is very good Georgian food and I am just not a fan of the cuisine.

That being said, I felt the whole meal was lacking in flavor. There were no detectable seasonings in any of the dishes we ordered. We got the taste of Georgia (one of the cheeses on the plate was extremely salty and the cornbread was very dry), two orders of the cheese and nut dumplings which just tasted of cheese, the cheese boat (adjaruli) and the chvishtari. None of the food wowed us. We were a group of five and left feeling barely satiated.

The prices are a bit high considering what you get and the service was pretty slow. We all agreed we would not go back.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,"Service was excellent, however, it was extremely loud and we were disappointed with most of our meal. We've dined at quite a few Georgian restaurants in NYC and abroad and this was the poorest in term of food. What was good? The wine, the adjaruli and the adjabsandali (eggplant). What was not so good? The simple salad and our main dish, the chakapuli with mushrooms. As our server said, the chakapuli is an ""acquired taste"". We disliked it enough that we couldn't eat it, told them we did not enjoy it (which we never do!) but the restaurant charged us anyways.

In terms of ambience, we were seated in the back room at a communal table. We wouldn't have minded this so much but it was so so loud we could barely hear each other.

Really wanted to love this place but we both kinda felt like we just threw $100 away.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Every item we ordered was flavorful and delicious! For drinks me and my friend ordered the wine flight which was only ten dollars for three Georgian wines - a red, white, and amber, all were amazing.  

We ordered the adjaruli a traditional open faced  khachapuri with egg and cheese (think of an amazing cheesy bread bowl).  This is a must have! We also had a cold eggplant dish (Adjabsandali), their housemade dumplings with goat cheese and nuts  (Khinkali),  and the Chakapuli with lamb (a stew).  Words cannot express how delicious everything was you will need to experience this for yourself.

Service was amazing and attentive.  Even with a full dining room the waiter still came by refilled the water at the exact right time.  I am so happy we were able to get in here without a reservation.  Will for sure come back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,"Great place! Never tried Georgian food before and really enjoyed this experience. The most unique item was definitely the cheese bread, they bake it fresh and fill it to the brim with cheese and butter. Not exactly the healthiest but it was delicious!

We also had lamb/pork medallions and lamb stew for entrees, both were cooked well and very unique. The food here is on the heavier side, so not exactly the place for vegan heart healthy food.

If you get what I mean. I recommend the pear lemonade, it's hard to explain but it tastes like how it sounds. A pear lemonade. If your going to get wine I also recommend to get a bottle.

As others have said, the Taste of Georgia appetizer platter and the cheese butter egg bread are a must. Amazing. If there are two of you, you won't need more. Meat dumplings are yummy but they're nothing special beyond being meat dumplings, and the game hen in garlic sauce was heavy and bland - not recommended.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"I loved Georgian food and this is the first Georgian spot I've tried in the city. The food here was quite delicious. We tried the cheese bread with an egg which was creamy and delicious. We also had the taste of Georgia appetizer which I highly recommend. There was a little of everything here and I loved the smelly cheeses and eggplant rolled with walnut butter and pomegranate seeds. Lastly, we finished off with the cheese and potato dumplings which were slathered in butter and delicious. My only complaint is that the food was too rich but that is likely our fault for ordering the richest dishes on the menu. Service was excellent and prices reasonable. The place itself looks trendy though the inside could be slightly more upscale considering some of the entree prices. I'd love to come back here and try the short rib entree.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,"I kept reading great things about CM and I was really looking forward to eating here.

Unfortunately, my family was very underwhelmed by this place.

The best part of the meal was an egg and cheese bread. However, the rest of our order was subpar and overpriced.

We tried a tomato and cucumber salad which was OK but nothing special and very small for $9. (The menu said there were pomegranate seeds in the salad but there weren't any). We also ordered dumplings which were mediocre and very overpriced at three dumplings for $11 (the menu said there were chopped nuts in the dumplings but there weren't any).

Furthermore, we ordered some kind of marinated mushrooms entree. This was underwhelming and would have been far more appropriate had it been categorized as an appetizer rather than as a main course.

The reviews for CM are good so maybe it's just me but I wasn't impressed.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,The atmosphere and service at Chama Mama were both well done. The food was very cheese heavy. I came with a group of my girlfriends and we ordered several items off the menu but they were mostly cheese filled and lacked finesse and refinement. The apps were well seasoned and the bread selection was very tasty. I wish they had more food options that weren't cheese centric as it became quite cumbersome to eat. Honey cake was definitely the star of the show. Don't skimp on that!,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Great place! This is a Georgian restaurant. As someone who grew up in the region (Azerbaijan - a country neighboring Georgia), and familiar with Georgian cuisine, we were very pleased with the taste, quality and the overall experience. We went for a dinner with 5 adults and 2 kids on a Friday night, and it was busy. The decor is modern, and service was very friendly and attentive. They have a clay oven in the kitchen where bread and their signature Khachapuri and Adjaruli cheese stuffed dough are baked. You can see the oven through the glass walls.

The food was delicious. Adjaruli - baked dough with cheese and egg in the middle - was amazing. So were the rest of meals we ordered: Khachapuri (thin dough stuffed with cheese), a combination appetizer platter, Megruli Kharsho beef short ribs braised in walnut sauce, Shkmeruli chicken in garlic creme sauce and Chakapuli lamb with tarragon sauce.

My favorite among Georgian dishes, Khinkali - dumplings with ground beef and pork mix - had soup broth running into your mouth when you bite the dumpling. Personally I would like a little more kick in it, which is how it is traditionally, often served with red pepper flakes. I added some adjika (spicy pepper paste that cane with bread basket) to the dumplings before taking a bite- and it did the trick . But otherwise it was done right.

We also had a bottle of Georgian wine, which was great with a character of its own due to its traditional clay-barrel aging. Kids love the sparkling tarragon soda. Overall, a great restaurant for a different cuisine experience in the heart of Manhattan.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Food here is heavenly. For first timers, definitely get the Cheese Boat and the Taste of Georgia platter. The dumplings with meat filling was good - very similar to Asian soup dumplings but with thicker skin and no soup haha.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Wowww... Super impressed with the flavors in this adorable little spot.  Highly recommend reservations (this place was PACKED when I came in and I just happened to get a spot at the bar because I was dining by myself). Food and wine pairings were delicious...staff was moderately friendly but seemed a bit frazzled (will chalk it up to being recently opened). Overall, a wonderful experience and great location.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"3/5 stars because of price alone.
I just can't get over the $60 meat platter which could pay for a full meal of equal quality at other places.

4/5 star for ambiance and food quality. Plenty of space for large parties. No wait for Saturday brunch.

5/5 for service.

Would I return? Probably not.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,We love going here. Even with all the choices in the neighborhood it stands out as unique in what the menu and staff offers. A mixture of comfort and taste with a welcoming vibe.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"If you havent been to this place, you have to! I live two blocks from this place and it is on my way to subway. I saw it open a little while ago. I was meaning to try it. Finally today I did and I am happy that we did. They are super friendly, lovely service, authentic food and wine list that I havent seen in other places, special and unique wines from Georgia ! The country !

Anyways try it if you havent..... I am planning to be a regular since it is so close to my apartment...",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"This is the third Georgian restaurant I've been to. Based on the previous ones, I thought I would enjoy it more.

The Khinkali dumplings were good, but not as good as the other two places I thought the dough on the kachupuri was good, but overall the dish was bland. I was surprised that I really liked the Country Style Salad -- about the only thing I would go back for. The waitress was really selling the Ekala, so we tried it. Liked it but did not love it.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Yum Yum Yum ... with no expectations, the lunch was beyond perfect with a best friend.  The food quality and taste were good; the service is friendly and sweet.  We ate so happily and cannot wait for next time.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"We were absolutely blown away. None of us had had Georgian food before so we really didn't know what to expect. As soon as you walk in, the restaurant smells like spices and everyone looks like they're having a good time. Forgive me for not remembering the actual names--we got the cheesy bread to start, and we could've ordered three more of that. We also split amongst ourselves the beef stew and the mushroom shared plate and it was like we'd never eaten food before. We finished off with the honey cake and some tea, which was the perfect end for sure. The restaurant can get a little loud, but the food is so delicious it's really hard to mind much.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"As legit as any Georgian place can be in the NYC considering some sourcing issues that would be present. Please do go there with Georgian cheese. Aggressively.

The wine list could be a tad bit better though they do hit the all the major notes. Hopefully it will shake out in a month or so.

The side salads are probably the only thing that was disappointing -- in the US one pretty much has to use the Persian cucumbers and heirloom tomatoes.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"There are truly few places as unique, delicious, and polished as Chama Mama. This is an absolute gem. It's the perfect date spot, girl's night spot, bring-your-parents-to-dinner spot, all of the above. It feels fancy but somehow still cozy.

We did the whole thing: the wine, the Georgian tasting plate, the Khinkali (Georgian dumplings stuffed with broth and meat, hope I spelled this right), the Khachapuri (the cheese, egg, and butter bread boat that you've definitely seen on Instagram), plus a dessert reminiscent of cheesecake. It all has elements of things that are cozy and familiar, like warm bread with cheese and meats, but still with plenty of vegetarian options that never felt like a substitute. There was really something for everyone, and it was all insanely flavorful and yummy. I noted that Chama Mama feels like the largest restaurant in New York just because of how fresh, modern, and open it is.

If you are in New York, please don't miss this unique experience!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"I love Georgian food so I was happy to see this new restaurant open. The food is amazing. We tried Eggplant appetizer, Beef and pork khinkali, Pork with fried potatoes, khacapuri. I will mention the bread that comes with it. Oh and Napoleon cake for dessert. Try Pheykhoa Compot for a drink if you want something different.
The people working at the restaurant are very friendly and hospitable.
The prices are reasonable. Hope to come again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,Came here on a Friday night without a reservation but got seated right away. A popular spot. Got the adjaruli. Delicious! Service was a bit slow but friendly.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Very chill place with super attentive staff! Service was very friendly, food came out really quickly.
I got there at 5:30 and it wasn't busy, but got busier somewhere around 6:30.
Great selection of Georgian wine! You can even have wine flights to learn more about Georgian wine tastes.
I had the taste of Georgia as a starter and acharuli as second.
I was sharing everything with my friend, otherwise I could have had the whole Khachaputi all by myself!
Definitely recommend!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"A fairly new edition to the neighbor and the experience was great! This was the first time trying Georgian food and we were celebrating  my cousins birthday. We started off trying a wine flight to see what was best. Our waitress recommended an Amber wine since it was unique and we got a bottle of the Mosmieri-Kakhuri. As a carb lover, this place is amazing with lots of cheese bread aka Khachapuri. We went with the imeruli and once it was place on the table, it was gone that I almost didn't get to take a picture. The bread is made fresh in the kitchen and came out hot and cheesy in the center. For apps, we got A Taste of Georgia which is a sample of their cold plates of bread, cheeses, beets, eggplants, yogurt, pepper, etc. for our main meal, we decided on the Butcher's choice and the meats were tender and packed with flavors. The food and service were great!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"This place is delicious! We're so glad that it has stayed open for takeout and deliveries during PAUSE so we can continue to enjoy delicious Georgian food. Don't miss the adjaruli (open faced cheese bread), khinkali (Georgian dumplings), and stews! The honey cake is amazing too",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"The restaurant ambience is very unique, big space, a 100 year old wall they preserved from an old restaurant, a  modern bar area, overall it's very impressive, service is good and waiters are friendly. As for dishes- khinkali ( dumplings) were great, thin dough which is a must, however the small plates are tiny. For example: walnut eggplant- a slice of eggplant is cut into 2 , overall you get three bites for 9$ which is not even enough to give you the real taste of that appetizer. Another small plate- adgapsandali, was not cooked properly and was impossible to chew. Good place to sit at the bar and have a glass of wine, probably when you are not that hungry. We spent $150 for 2 glasses of wine and a few dishes, taking into account the size of portions this place a bit overpriced compared to other Georgian restaurants.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"This place was AMAZING! You should absolutely try this place if you get the chance. The cheese bread is amazing, I would literally eat it everyday if I could. The dumplings and chicken were also good, but wow that cheese bread was to die for.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy my self here. the photos didn't look like anything I'd be interested in at all, but my partner wanted to try it out, so I went a long for ride. I was pleasantly surprised! The food was amazing! The staff was solid and the atmosphere was a delight. We will be back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Such a trendy, yet cozy place with great wine selection from Georgia. The staff is very friendly and the food is delicious. Will definitely be back again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Great wine list. Food was also delicious, but very carb-heavy. If you're looking for bready, cheesy deliciousness, come here! If not, just come for a few glasses of funky, fermented wine and head somewhere else in the neighborhood.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"We tried this new place for takeout--it was so delicious! I had never tried Georgian food before but I highly recommend it, and was not disappointed! I hope it lasts on 14th street, where it seems that there is a lot of turnover for new places.

The cheese/egg bread that everyone recommends was awesome--probably by favorite part. I also loved the dumplings! The short ribs were good, though I didn't love the cuts of meat that much so I would likely stick with the vegetarian options from now on.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Chama Mama is fairly new to the neighborhood--it's a warm addition. The first thing that catches your eye is the layout of the restaurant, and given how tight real estate space is in NYC, the owners really utilized the concept of ""open space"" very well. Love:
- The ""open"" kitchen--despite the space taken up by it, this design actually makes the restaurant seem spacious
- The bright lights and natural colors (NYC restaurants tend to have dimmer lighting)
- Beautiful and not cramped bar seating at the front

The portions here are larger than expected, and all that my friend and I could eat for lunch was their basket of homemade bread and penovani. If you're a carbs and cheese type of person, then Chama Mama is probably the perfect place for you.

Might I add service is on-point. The managers and servers are kind, and this type of attention and sincerity almost made me do a double-take.

I'd really like to return and sit at the bar and try the protein dishes at some point.

Cheers!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,Fantastic food. The taste of Georgia selection of apps (all vegetarian which I appreciated) was the highlight - really interesting flavors. We also had the dumplings and the Kachapuri cheese bread (specifically the adjaruli - they have a range!). All delicious. Great range of Georgian wines too - we tried the amber which was unusual but paired well with the food. Will definitely come back here!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"This is very distantly reminds one of Georgian cuisine, which I know and live :(
I was surprised that several authentic Georgians were actually dining next to us.
Flavors, textures and level of spiciness were completely missing.
I couldn't find one dish - except for Khachapuri with cheese and with beans - which reminded me of Georgia. Soup was not even worthy of school cafeteria! Chohohbili with chicken and lobio were shameful!
We were a party of 6 and were able to order many dishes which left us disappointed.
Also portions were pitiful!
Sad...",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"It was our first time ever trying this cuisine, and we were ecstatic to. Not once were we explained the menu or what we ordered, and our server was quite rude. My partner has a nut allergy and when we asked if the dish had nuts we received snarky remarks. The dishes were small and pretty overpriced. Overall disappointed with this experience since we've heard such great things. We will not be returning.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,I love everything about this place. It's one of my favorite places in the city. You can't go wrong ordering anything but you must get the cheeseboats. They are heavenly!!!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"This place is my new favorite GEM ! Everything is so delicious. make sure u order homemade bread basket with 2 different butter one with tarragon and one with special ""svanuri"" salt and traditional georgian ""adjika"" which is bit spicy but so so good ! This evening I had ""Elarji"" which was outstanding and comes with very very good ""baje "" also know as walnuts sauce with spices! and Adjaruli Khachapuri which was one of the best i tryed in NY ! Pricewisw is very good not overpriced and reasonable! Thank you so much Team "" Chama Mama"" for your hospitality !",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"It was my first time trying Georgian food and I absolutely loved it. The adjaruli cheese + egg bread is a must-order. It's truly delicious and just melts in your mouth. I would also recommend ""a taste of Georgia"" if you'd like to try everything from the appetiser section.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"This was surpassingly delicious. I had no preset expectations, and would definitely come back.

The taste of Georgia plate was super generous and could have served as a lite dinner for two on its own. For $25 in manhattan that's saying something. We had the cheese grits dish (recommended on Eater) and loved it. It looks like it will be plain and tasteless but ends up being rich and salty and with a surprisingly complex texture from the cheese. The cheese breads are great too. I look forward to trying more. I can see his being a place where I take out of town guests who are looking for something cool yet unusual. Oh, the vibe and service were both top notch too.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"What a great new addition to Chelsea! The food was delicious and reasonably priced. We walked in around 715 on a Saturday evening and it was packed. We were able to grab a seat within 10 minutes of walking in and we did not have a reservation. However, since the restaurant seems to be getting more popular it would be smart to make a reservation for future dining. My partner and I ordered the Georgian sample cold platter one small hot plate (land stuffed grape leaves), and one hot platter (apkhazura) and we were satisfied. We got a bottle of the Marani Alexandreuli and that was the lightest red wine they had!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,"This was my first try of Georgian food and it didn't disappoint. Carbs, cheese and Mediterranean flare sign me up. The national dish of Georgia the kachapuri is the prize of the restaurant and deservedly so. The cheese is delicious and salty with an egg scrambled inside. Make sure to eat it right as you get it so it's nice and melty. Also try the pear soda it's like bubble gum and make sure to share as the bottle is enormous.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Super delicious! The waitstaff was great with my two young kids and they loved everything we ordered. We had planned on hitting up Cheeseboat, but they were closed for a private event.

Chama Mama,"First, the only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because of their wine list and not the food or service.  Ok now we got that out of the way I can go into details of our first experience there.  I Yelp the area and not particular for any type of restaurant, this place showed up and after reading the reviews I decided to give a try. The place is new so not much photos to look at ( I took a few more of the interior and it is very clean, minimal and modern).  Upon entering we were greeted right away, I like that because I hate pretentious host/hostess that makes people wait upon entering.  Then we were seated in the back of the restaurant, the whole restaurant is set up with the kitchen in the middle,  spacious and yet intimate.  The we looked over the menu, our server was very helpful and my husband being French looked over the wine list wasn't too thrilled.  We know Georgian wine then to be on the sweet side so we like medium to dry red wine.  He even suggested sampling the wine and even brought over the manager or owner of the restaurant ( a beautiful elegant woman who is also very friendly and helpful) and in the end we ordered a bottle of the Georgian Cabernet.  The food we ordered was delicious and the service was wonderful and hopefully they will expand their wine list.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Amazing Georgian Cuisine has finally arrived in New York City! Conveniently located on 14th street near the corner of 7th Avenue, Chama Mama is a pure delight. Our group tasted a bit of everything and owner Tamara stopped by our table to walk us through all the delicacies on the menu.

Our favorites included a variety of Cheese Breads.  You must try the Adjaruli, which is an open faced Khachapuri with cheese and egg.  Simply delicious! And oh so cheesy! The Imeruli, The Georgian's take on Pizza, is also excellent. The Khinkali, a homemade dumpling with lamb and a soup base inside was pure comfort food. And my personal favorite, the Butcher's Choice, which on our visit was a perfectly cooked lamb kebab.

Great food.  Great service. A must visit. We will be back again soon for sure. Thank you to Tamara and her wonderful staff at Chama Mama for an amazing feast of Georgian cuisine and warm service with a smile.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,Wonderful food and ambiance. Rude staff that sat me and my trained service dog in the back of the almost empty restaurant. They even asked another guest to move so we had to sit at the very back table in the corner. Love the food just very disappointed in the segregation that goes against ADA guidelines.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"I love Chama Mama.  It's casual, budget friendly, laid back and yet elegant and appetite fulfilling.  Their winner and my personal favorite is the Imeruli Kachapuri, a freshly baked bread with cheese and butter. A crowd pleaser for the winter and enough to keep you going for the entire day.  The service is very friendly, the spot is in the perfect location (14 street between 6 and 7 avenue); everything is extremely clean and well decorated.  This is my first time trying Georgian food: what a delightful surprise.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Absolutely love the service, the atmosphere and the fact they have an in house special brick oven. We tried the pickles, the kebab (sausage), the cheese boat and the napoleon for desserts. All items were excellent and the service was just perfect. Their cheery compote is a great drink as well. Well balanced, fresh, desert not too sweet and the pickles were just amazing! Will come back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Khachapuri: The freshness of the bread, the right blends of cheese results in one of the best dishes I've ever had.  The atmosphere is spacious and a great open kitchen makes you feel great about every dish.  Highly recommend! (My second review ever!)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"I discovered Chama Mama simply because it's nearby a friend's place in Chelsea. And, I'm very happy with the discovery.

I had the opportunity to try only two dishes. The adjaruli khachapuri is everything I had read about. The texture and flavour of the bread boat is great, chewy and tasty, but the cheese, egg and butter filling is over the top. It's all homey, satisfying goodness. It is a carb load, so consider sharing with a friend.

The chakapuli with braised lamb was delightful. The lamb is very tender and the broth flavourful, but the tarragon adds a whole other dimension to the dish. I happen to be a big fan of tarragon, so I loved this dish.

I will definitely go back to try more on the menu. I thought the portion of chakapuli was a bit small for the price. Some plates are better value than others. I saw the taste of Georgia cold plate sampler delivered to another table. It seemed quite reasonably priced for the quantity. So, it is not cheap eats, but the quality and flavours help you to justify trying it out.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Loved the food and the service!
This is the first time my friend and I tried Georgian food and we were so happy with the experience.

We ordered a taste of Georgia, Chakapuli with lamb and Adjaruli, the cheese boat bread. A taste of Georgia is a colorful cheese/veggie plate that gives you a little bit of everything; Chakapuli with lamb (my favorite) is sour lamb soup which would be perfect for a cold day, and Adjaruli the cheese boat bread definitely live up to the hype! All the dishes we ordered were served with breads and the breads were delicious too.

Nina was very kind and attentive and gave us good recommendations on what to order. She's also very friendly in introducing us to Georgian food and culture. Thank you!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,Ate here last night with a friend. The food was fantastic. I couldn't decide what I wanted from the cold plates so I got the Taste of Georgia and loved every bit of it.

Chama Mama,"A very disappointed dinner experience. I live just one block away from the restaurant so I walked by it a few times and I wanted to try it out. I saw it has nice reviews on the Yelp so I went with my family for the Mother's Day dinner. As I am not familiar with the food so I asked the host lady for some recommendations. She suggested some dishes and we also looked at the pictures from yelp. I ordered a cocktail from one of the pictures which I showed it to her but later I received a complete different look drink. When I asked the host and she said it looks different because of the light from the picture. The one I got has a taste like coffee mix but the one I wanted from the picture has lemon peel (I post pictures here for you guys to compare). When they start serving our food we received hot dishes and main course first. We got our mix cold plates ""A taste of Georgia"" appetizer after our main course. And our hot cheese bread ""Adjaruli"" came last when we are too full to eat it. We had to pack the hot cheese bread home. This is so wrong. Either they don't care or they don't know the sequence of what should be served first. The food is ok but not amazing. I think it is pretty pricey for what it is. Terrible service! I probably won't go back this place again since we got so many much nicer restaurants in the neighborhood.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Stepped into the restaurant by accident, they have a large array of all Georgian wines and liquor. I highly recommend trying their Amber wine selection. I had the Taste if Georgia and Butcher's Choice. Both very herbal and refreshing dishes.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"It was the second time we went there. First time was perfect and the service was great. This time even though we made our reservation the day before they put us waay in the back. Shortly into our meal we realized the high traffic near our table was due to the restroom. We brought it to attention of the server, however nothing was done. For almost $200 eating and smelling foul orders coming from the restroom made this experience far from pleasant. In addition the staff was going back and forth to the back yard which happen to be immediately behind us. It's December so every time they would open the door we felt the cold draft.  In my humble opinion, this table shouldn't be there. No one wants to dine right next to the restroom. We liked this place the first time that's why I'm giving them 2 stars but we are not coming back after the second",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Finally a new different taste. Very clean classy place , excellent food, excellent service and very friendly .
I definitely recommend Chama MamA.
We didn't have a reservation and were able to be seated.

Chama Mama,"I was anticipating the opening since last November, hoping that it will at least match food of Old Tbilisi (I stopped going there due to their unfriendly service.) When Chama Mama opened, I was pleasantly surprised with beautiful, newly renovated interior. I was eager to give it a try and ordered a few things for take-out. Unfortunately, food lacked flavor (which is impossible for Georgian cuisine) and was overpriced for what it was. I didn't like the dough that they used to make Imeruli Khachapuri. Adjabsandali, that had no flavor what so ever, was overpriced (you get about 4.5 oz of the appetizer for $9 + tax..) You get about same amount of Ekala. Basically, for a take-out lunch you'll pay about $40 and not get much. Not sure this place will survive ;-(",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"I had the most horrible experience at ""Chama Shmama"", very unprofessional service. All i want to do is support other Georgians so they can flourish their business but the biggest downfall is taking criticism as an offense and attacking you instead of trying to make it better for a customer. Half the food came out cold and when confronting about it, they had a sassy attitude and then blamed the customer for not liking cold food that is meant to be served hot.i was so ready for warm energy ,yummy food and much love, the way georgians treat, all i got was sassy vibes,aggressive energy and cold food , where is peace & love ?!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,I have been wanting to try this new Georgian restaurant.  I saw they had brunch menu so I decided to try it.  The place is lovely. Sweet staff but my cornbread with salad and cheese was not what I expected. The cheese was very salty. I shouldn't have ordered it with my high blood pressure. It looked lovely but with the 2 cheeses so salty I really don't expect to go back any time soon,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,My husband and I tried this restaurant on a trip to New York and the food was amazing! Neither of us has tried Georgian food before and we didn't really know what to expect. Everything we ordered was delicious. There were some issues with the service while we were there but the quality and freshness of the food made up for any service issues.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Really was excited to try this place. Food was fine but nothing special. $22 for 4 tiny chunks of beef is ridiculous. The taste of Georgia plate had a few good dips, but some lacked flavor. Breads were great. Dishes arrived in a weird fashion- dips, then beef, then bread. We were completely rushed.  Rez at 7:00, out at 7:28. Absolutely ridiculous. $80 meal that was small and not that good. Would not recommend",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,Good food...especially the bread. I'm giving it a 3 star strictly due to the incredibly loudness of this place.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Very loud, busy place. Food and wine are  less then mediocre, the worst representation of Georgian food. Visited Georgia couple of years ago, so we know their cuisine. Khinkali had very thick dough, that wasn't cook through. Khachapuri was far from real tasty and juicy ones. Wine (Mariani) was overpriced and below average.
The service: the waiter was trying his best, we had 8 people at our table, he was trying to accommodate everybody but he had quite few other tables to serve, so no personal attention. For the price they charge you should get more service and explanations (we didn't need any but I'm sure a lot of people are not familiar with Georgian cuisine and would like to get some).",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,Delicious!!! I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Me and a friend shared the cheese.egg and butter filled bread. It was very tasty. The bread was warm and chewy. The server mixed the egg and butter in with the cheese and the egg cooked from th heat of the cheese and bread. We also ordered braised rib dish. It was very good. I don't normally eat red meat but this was very good and not as heavy as I thought it was going to be. It's stewed in a gravy and serves with grit patties that reminded me of polenta. I will definitely go back to try other items on the menu.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"A bit expensive but good quality food. Great ambience. Servings are small to be honest even though some are technically ""shares"". Interesting food and not run of the mill Mediterranean. We ordered the cheese platter and the cheese dumplings and the roti (which was also full of cheese). We were a bit too cheesesed out but whose complaining if you're down for it

Won't recommend the dessert with oats and some honey etc. it's like eating a breakfast item - not the dessert-y feeling you want to get for a Friday dining experience.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

My experience was delightful beginning to end...wonderful, welcoming service by the owner and the bartender, DELICIOUS, food, and friendly company at the bar.  You can tell they take pride in what they do.  I tried the khinkali dumplings with cheese (heaven), which were simple yet give new meaning to comfort food, the chakapuli with lamb, a broth soup with tarragon and far more depth of flavor than I ever expected, and the walnut stuffed eggplant.  Each unique and flavorful in their own right.  I can't wait to go back and bring more people with me to experience more of their menu!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Chama Mama,"Great new and interesting restaurant on the area! I went with 3 friends last night and between us we ordered almost the entire menu. Each dish was unique with different flavors and you could tell they took their time in preparing them. My personal favorites were the Ardjarul which was fluffy and delicious with the egg yolk, the roasted wild mushrooms which had a great earthy taste to them, and the beef short rib which came in an amazon of walnut sauce. Oh and don't forget the wine, some really great dry red wines.

Service was also fantastic. This will be a new go to stop for me!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Chama Mama,"Came here for dinner without a reservation and was seated at the bar, despite there being a few open seats and one table covered in papers and a laptop and coffee, presumably in use by management. Sitting at the bar made it easier to try a few of the wines before settling on the Sami, a red blend. The Though I left most of the menu untouched, none of the cheeses and nut / herb spreads in the very instagram-friendly appetizer sampler disappointed, and the lamb stew was rich and satisfying without being too heavy for a spring night. They seem very social media savvy (the menu even suggests 'gramming the khachapuri, ha), and sure enough it was packed by 9 so I guess they've got their marketing down! A very good experience overall.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chama-mama-new-york?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Had this today for the first time and let me tell you, this actually is THE BEST lobster roll I've had yet..

Maybe it's the combination of butter and a little mayo along with those delicious herbs!! But there was sooooo much FLAVOR in the lobster roll!

The prices aren't as high as I thought.
$17 for 4oz of lobster meat and $22 for 6oz.
Love how you can also get sides with your meal. I ordered the slaw and it was delish! LOVE the flavoring so unique! Glad they put enough vinegar in there.

The roll itself was tinier than I expected but definitely filling with a side! And that bun! So sweet and delicious with that butter herb sauce I'm salivating writing this!

Can't wait to return! Next time I want to try the crab roll and the Mac and cheese yum!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I absolutely love the lobster rolls. I'd come back in a heart beat for these rolls (From the Bronx) They are pricey but so worth it. You won't be disappointed. Lobster Mac and cheese was also very good. I love that they have bread crumbs on the side. Really good idea.

I would've given it a 5 star but I was a little disappointed with the service. One of the young ladies at the register got pretty sassy with me for literally no reason. I know, it was hot, long lines, people waiting for their orders I get it but one day she's going to say the wrong thing to the wrong person.

She was taking my order and told me the total
Cashier: ""it's $27.22""
Me: hands her $40 *remembered I had a quarter in my bag* ""Oh wait! I have a quarter! Is it too late?!""
Cashier: ""No, I know how to do math.""
Me: =|

Now, I really tried not to let the Bronx out and respond with the a ""congratulations"" because I didn't want anybody to spit in my food but on top of that she was sassy with other people. Giving an attitude because they didn't respond fast enough for her. She even mocked somebody's name. I can tell that she was annoyed but girl, get another job if you're unhappy. There's lots of people hiring other places.

I mean, I'm still going back lol I just hope she's only there on Sundays. I can work around it.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I think the lobster rolls at Luke's are one of the best I've had. I really enjoyed it. I also had the lobster Mac and cheese , that was just ok. The size is really small for such a big price.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I've always heard about Luke's Lobster and with their many locations, was excited to try my very first lobster roll...ever! Lobster rolls can get quite pricey so I tried to get the most bang for my buck with the trio which had 1/2 lobster roll, 1/2 shrimp roll, 1/2 crab roll with a bag of chips ($19.50). All 3 rolls were bland, under seasoned and the bread were very soggy. It was quite disappointing as this was also my first experience with lobster roll!

It's set up to be fast food style so you order at the window and get notified once your food is ready! I decided to go for the lobster roll and slaw.

The lobster roll was really good! The roll was soft and lightly toasted. They were generous with the amount of lobster and it was nice and and fresh!
The poppy slaw was ok and the cashier did use the word ""healthy"" when i asked how it taste. It's an interesting vinaigrette used but I'm still glad i tried it instead of the cape cod chips.

There is seating outside to the right of the location and it was a beautiful day so we ate outside.

Pro:
-Very buttery, rich
-Lobster was yummy and tasted extremely fresh
-Cheese, lobster, and butter is a bomb combo
-Right under the Brooklyn Bridge so it's really nice to walk to

Con:
-The size is very small, so don't expect to feel full after
-The amount of lobster was really small
-The lobster was unevenly distributed on the sandwich
-I wish the bread was toasted a bit longer so that it would be crunchy

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"The best lobster roll in NYC!  My favorite Luke's Lobster location.  This location is more of a shack near the water, so you can order food and walk over to the pier and eat it outdoors and get some sun.   There's nothing like eating some delicious lobster and being closer to nature.  Being outside, Walking around the park and and enjoying scenic water views.  So relaxing.  It's like being on a micro mini vacation.

Now on to the yummy stuff.  I usually get the Luke's Trio sampler (lobster, shrimp, & crab 1/2 rolls), plus a drink and a side and/or soup.  

Lobster rolls are stuffed with fresh from Maine, a 1/4 lb of lobster claw, knuckle, and leg meat.  A bit of mayo on bun and topped with warm lemon butter and secret seasoning.  Just the way I like it.  You can really taste the freshness of the sweet lobster meat.  

Crab roll is pretty tasty too.  Very fresh.  The shrimp roll is just okay for me.  There is nothing wrong with it.  It's just not a favorite.  

Download the Luke's Lobster app.  For every five visits spending $10 or more, you will earn a free lobster roll. You will also get a free shrimp roll on your birthday.

There is indoor seating area in the back of the shop but you have to enter through the rear door.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I'm such a sucker for seafood. This is kind of like a fast food lobster take out with LARGE CHUNKY pieces of lobster. Located underneath the Brooklyn bridge, this little place offers delicious lobster rolls! I wish I ordered three, but that would seem to beast.

There's not much to say about the place itself- literally a small place enough for staff and the kitchen with a tiny dining place in the back and outdoor seating on the side of the tiny building. Menu is simple since it clearly specializes in lobster rolls.

Typing up this review is making my mouth water because I can remember just how good those rolls were. The bread itself was slathered in butter (not literally slathered), but enough where it gives the roll flavoring. The pieces of lobster in there felt like I ate an entire lobster and it was definitely very filling where I wasn't overly stuffed but not starving.

I would love to come back here during the spring/summer time because the area is such a nice place to walk around. I'd definitely get their combo next time that offers soup on the side.

It seems like its a little over priced for what you get.  The meat was a little dry but very tender.  It reminded me of dry pulled pork that is cold.  It could have used a tad bit more butter to bring out the taste.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

I had the lobster roll with lobster bisque - full of chunks of chilled lobster sprinkled with just enough seasoning wrapped in a warm brioche bun - yum! My second roll was the crab roll.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Luke's lobster location in Dumbo is great, right underneath the bridge. However, the waiting for this fast foodish take out was ridiculous. For maybe 15 people waiting on line, it took like 40 minutes to finally get to the cashier and order my food. It was a busy weekend day and there were 2 people working. 1 people getting the order and money and another person preparing food. If you know it's a busy weekend and weather's getting nicer, you need to prepare more appropriate number of staffs.

Anyway, and the food. It's not my first time trying Luke's lobster so we just went with the lobster roll and crab roll without any mini combo options. I did get the truffle one with an extra dollar charge for the lobster roll. They probably dropped some truffle oil on lobster but it was awesome. However, both the lobster and crab meats were so cold. They probably just take out them out of the refrigerator and add them on the bread. Come on, take them out and let them thaw a bit. It was so cold, I couldn't really taste them. The breads are always good though. It's got that sweetness the more you bite into it.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Each lobster roll I've had has been worthy of high praise. Most recently I tried the white truffle lobster roll, a seasonal option lasting until the end of April. It was phenomenal! I didn't think it was possible to improve on the simple excellence that is a lobster roll, and then in walks this magnificence. Also noteworthy are the soups (lobster bisque and clam chowder). One day I'll get around to trying a shrimp or crab roll, but to date I've continued to be wooed by the sweet taste of lobster. Yes, the price tag is a bit on the hefty side, but it's truly worth it.

Granted, that also means that their lobster rolls are normally prohibitively expensive for a normal meal, especially with their diminutive size. But they are tasty and loaded with lobster chunks. I think Red Hook Lobster Pound edges them out, but only slightly.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,oh my goodness I don't know where to start. We were visiting New York and obviously checking out the Brooklyn bridge and wanted to grab food around the area. We stumbled upon this place and we were seated right away. The seating area is pretty smaller but then again it was super cold so there was no outside seating. I ordered the lobster roll combo with lobster bisque and my boyfriend ordered the jumbo lobster roll with lobster Mac and we loved all of it. We met the manager Sean and he was super cool and also another worker (I didn't get him name) was super awesome as well and he gave us a cup of chowder on the house which was so nice of him (the chowder was also really good!) All in all the food was great and the hospitality was 10/10. Next time we come visit NY this is one of the places that we have to come back to!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Gross. They have gone downhill. Lobster and crab rolls were so cold. Just defrosted i guess

Crab roll was mostly the debris vs actual crab meat. See picture. Save your money. Go to shake shack across thebway

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"PDG--pretty damn good.  Also expensive.  But they have an excellent gluten free game for a little outdoor stand.
We had walked over the Brooklyn bridge earlier and were overdue for lunch.  Our daughter had clued me in earlier in the day that Luke's had GF rolls.
Whoopie!  I get to have a Lobster Roll.  We were at the Jersey Shore the day before and we ate somewhere with lobster rolls but they didn't have the GF bread.  I had a nice salad but it wasn't the same.
Luke's staff was very careful to make sure my roll wasn't toasted on the same part of the grill as the regular bread.  Also not to butter it.  
So I had a lobster roll and a canned cider and my hubs had a crab roll and a canned beer.  Total was a  little over $50.00.  I mean it was delicious but not 50.00 delicious so that's why only 4 stars.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Lobster rolls and beers did just fine.  We were able to snag a seat on the side while we enjoyed our rolls.  My only complaint is that they are on the smaller side but - what can you do??

The roll is buttered and toasted to perfection, their lobster wasn't overpowered by mayo, and they weren't skimpy with their fillings either! It's heaven on earth. :')

I ordered the trio for $20 (lobster, crab, shrimp in half sizes). I am a big fan of their famous lobster roll and crab roll, not so much the shrimp. It had a weird taste; the one I had might've not been fresh. But I'm super pleased by the other rolls, I still feel like it deserves 5 stars.

I do wish they would provide a pallet cleanser like a pickle on the side or etc.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"This place is an absolute joke!

I spent $50 to get two orders of lobster rolls, drinks, and chips, and the woman refused to give me my chips and was very rude.

The serving size one gets from this place is also very comical, as I have been to many other places in Brooklyn which sell the exact same thing for less, while giving a good portion-size.

The bread was hard like a hot dog bun which had been microwaved for 5 minutes straight. When I told the woman who had taken my order, she refused and stated that ""You get what you pay for."" If I wanted to buy a hard hot dog bun, I would've went to the grocery store and bought a pack of buns to microwave them myself!

I can't even begin to fathom why this place has a 4-star rating, and why people even come here, when there are so many better places that actually give a darn about the customer without trying to scam.

I will never, EVER, come to this place again!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Shrimp roll- excellent, very flavorful
Lobster roll- very good, the lobster tastes fresh
Crab roll- didn't like it. Had zero flavor.
Service- not up to par. Asked them to cut the rolls in half as I was sharing them with my husband to try. We got the trio so it was a half of each roll. Lol they said they couldn't cut it in half because it was already in half. Stupidity can't be cured so we just said ok. (FYI...Cut the bread in half and then put the toppings on so the customer doesn't have to do it...when I pay $23 for such little food I expect them to be able to cut a half roll in half).

(In response to reply)
Dear Sean,
We appreciate you replying back. Lol but we cut the half roll in half with the plastic knife ourselves just fine so we aren't sure why that service couldn't be provided to us for a minute, $23 roll sampler. We will show you next time how to use a knife if you'd like ;)",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I recently tried out Luke's Lobster when I was in the DUMBO area. I tried the Taste of Maine which was the sampler that came with 1/2 lobster roll, 1/2 crab roll, and 1/2 shrimp roll. The cost for this was $24 which initially I felt like was pretty high, but after getting our food and seeing how the rolls were stuffed to the brim with meat, I wasn't upset about the price tag.

This is unexpected, but my favorite of these three rolls was probably the shrimp roll! Whatever seasoning they used was fantastic! The lobster roll was also very delicious and had a ton of lobster in it. The crab was good, but definitely lower on my scale than the other two. The stand out thing for me here was the bread that these came on. It was so good and toasty. I was a little surprised when they came out and the meat was kind of cold (which I think was normal) and I think it would have tasted better warm, but that's just a personal opinion.

This location is very nice because it's right under the Brooklyn Bridge and you can overlook the water there. There is also an indoor seating area in the back of the shop but you have to enter through the rear door. There was no one in there when I visited (despite there being a giant line out front) so I feel like people might not know about it.

Definitely worth giving it a try though!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I had this meal as delivery and during lunchtime. I've been craving a lobster roll and remembered having Luke's Lobster when in Boston. While I wasn't blown away with it then, I like the idea of the trio since I'm so indecisive haha. The trio deal came with three 1/2 rolls consisting of crab, shrimp, and lobster. As part of the combo meal, I ordered the lobster bisque which was an additional $2 than if I had chosen the chowder instead. I was worried the sandwiches would be soggy but the establishment was smart to pack the butter on the side and this way at least you get manage the amount you want on your sandwich.

Upon opening my meal I thought they were small, but I'm greedy and always want more! Lobster rolls in particular, no matter where I've gotten them from just don't seem big enough. Well, it was more than enough as I got through the shrimp and crab and was stuffed before touching the lobster or the bisque. I ate the lobster anyway lol and tasted the bisque. Every single roll was delicious. Better than the first time and I would gladly order again. The sandwiches were thick with meat and the butter just ran down into the bread so with each bite there was flavor. The bisque was pretty tasty, could have used a touch more salt but that's just me- I'm sure I have high blood pressure.

My meal came to $33 with tax and free delivery. Seems a little steep but that's seafood in the summer for ya. I'm sure there are better rolls out there for the price but I enjoyed my experience here and would order again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Amazing Lobster Roll!

After walking across the Brooklyn Bridge, we reach over and enjoyed the view around DUMBO.  Truly amazing and inspiring view.  I was told that there is an amazing lobster roll place that was a must try and it was exactly what we did.

The menu was simple and to the point. The rolls: Lobster roll, crab roll and shrimp roll.  Since the lobster roll was highly recommended, I got the lobster roll and it was Ah-ma-zing! The pile of lobster on the soft bread roll was delicious and refreshing. One of the best lobster rolls I have ever had. Sauce isn't overpowering or excess, you can taste and see the lobster!

The line was long but it was worth the wait.
Price is reasonable for what they give and $17 for something fresh and tasty, I would take that any day.  Haven't tried the other stuff so can't give ratings on the other items.

I would recommend the lobster roll",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Love this chain. This location is directly beneath the Manhattan bridge and is counter-serve, with a few tables in the back. Kind of like the Shake Shack in Madison Square Park, just less busy and more expensive.

I ordered the trio (1/2 crab 1/2 shrimp 1/2 lobster) for the first time and it was delicious. The portions are tiny, though. Every time I order from here I remind myself this and still manage to be astonished each time. For $20+ I wish there was more food, but what you get is good. The bread is buttery beyond belief and stuffed to the brim with fresh seafood. The lobster is my favorite, followed by the crab, then the shrimp. That's also my preference order for the seafood in general though! They're all good.

Service wasn't the best - a little rushed and rude. There's a lot of space by the waterfront where you can take your food and eat. Overall, a worthwhile place!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"The line was 7-8 customers long, but they get through really fast. The food is also ready fast. I got the lobster roll with chips/drink for $20, but did contemplate the trio sample (lobster, shrimp, & crab 1/2 rolls) for a few bucks more. The roll is on the smaller side as it comes in a small carton box similar to that of what a 7/11 hot dog can go in. The bread is great & it's packed with big chunks of nicely cooked lobster meat with just enough flavor where it's not overly buttery or salty. For a quick meal, I'd come back, though due to size of the sandwich, it's slightly overpriced. Oh, & ask for pickles.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Luke's is just something one must do when in the area. There's something about sitting by the waterfront with a perfectly buttery lobster on a crispy on the inside but fluffy on the outaide roll that is just right.

They sell half rolls too! So you can experience the taste for less than $10. Granted it's tiny but the amount of lobster and freshness of taste is good value.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"What better place to feast on lobster rolls than right underneath the Brooklyn Bridge? There are plenty of locations all throughout NYC but this one was special. The location is just inside a small booth with outdoor seating nearby a small park.

Although Luke's Lobster is known for their lobster rolls, they're even more known for their Luke's trio with comes with their half-sized signature lobster roll, crab roll and shrimp roll as well as a soda and a bag of Cape Cod potato chips. We also ordered their halved lobster tail just because it was somewhat cheap. Everyone has their own version of seafood rolls but this one came dressed simply and unadorned with just a small swipe of mayo, lemon butter and their own seasoning. This really allows the natural sweetness of the seafood sing which I did appreciate.

Although the trio is a good deal for its price, the lobster roll was clearly the superior of the other two and I sort of wished I just got a full-sized lobster roll instead. The crab roll wasn't too bad but the shrimp roll was bland and forgettable. And we weren't expecting the halved lobster to be served ice-cold which made for an odd combination when dipped into the clarified butter it came with.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

This is to me, the most unbeatable Lobster roll. Each location that they have will make you feel you are in Maine.  I loved on how they arranged and designed their place.

It was more like between bland and it's decent. The only reason why I'm giving this a 3 is because my husband liked it more than me. Though he still wouldn't recommend this enthusiastically. If you're starving, wanting seafood and feel like paying for something overpriced bc you're in NYC, go here.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"As we wandered around during the last few hrs in New York, I saw a gal holding this sandwich filled with lobster... Enough said, I wanted one of my own. Man, it was quite expensive: $17 for a lobster roll. You might as try the combo (Luke's trio) for a couple of bucks more.

The combo, which the significant other and I ended up getting, was delish! The regular sized sandwich was cut in thirds (or so it seems until the menu says 1/2 of each): 1/2 lobster, 1/2 crab, 1/2 shrimp. The meats were topped to the brim of the sandwich. The breading was doused in butter so at the end we had buttery fingers.

Yes, it's rather expensive for the amount of food, but it's a good afternoon treat that was shareable.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"This Luke's Lobster location is beautiful and very enjoyable for a nice day, as all the seating is outside. I got the wild blue salad base with lobster added (although I think it might have been crab) this included mixed greens, pickled blueberries (amazing !! I've never had something like this before !), pine nuts, cabbage, and white beans. It was amazing and a really great option if you don't want the traditional lobster roll which I also love here ! I added the seasoning to the salad instead of the dressing and was really happy with my meal. My boyfriend tried the trio combo - three half rolls of the crab, shrimp, and lobster. The lobster was the favorite but he enjoyed the crab as well and thought the shrimp was okay.

I have been trying to get to Luke's Lobster for awhile now, there are so many locations in the city and I have heard such great things! But for some reason eating lobster in the middle of the city and not on the water is a TOTAL turn off for me.

I am so happy to say that my standards were MET AND MORE.

This location is AMAZING- it's a little shack basically, which is so authentic and welcoming. They have perfect out door seating that is perfectly shaded for the hot summer weather. There's a small section of in door seating as well but I recommend the out door.

The line was so long but it's expected on a Sunday afternoon. Even with the heat and how busy it was, the service was great, the cashier was so nice and the food came out in like 2 min.

I ordered the trio. Ommmfgg it was GREAT. The bread was perfectly toasted and the seafood was cold and refreshing. It was SO fresh & the quality was superb. Idk which one I liked better: crab, shrimp or lobster!! They were all insane.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Was in the area originally to check out Mr. Chocolate Jacques Torres' DUMBO location, when while looking to find a parking spot found this little gem literally at the foot of the Brooklyn bridge!  After checking out the chocolate shop (located two blocks East), we just had to order their lobster roll, especially in light of having had the ultimately disappointing and inexplicably touted best lobster roll in town at ""Jordan's Lobster Dock"" on the other side of Brooklyn over three weeks prior (see my review).  Since they also had a crab roll, that also was an absolute  must get . . .

Both lobster roll and crab rolls (each a quarter pound of meat) were served on buns that were too small to contain their goodness - both could definitely be enjoyed on a larger culinary transport vehicle.  That aside, its the melted lemon butter, mayo, and their secret seasoning that make each of these sandwiches shine!  There was just enough of this garnishment to enhance the natural flavor of the meat without overpowering it with too much condimental accompaniment.  I can definitely say that whomever voted Luke's the best lobster roll in New York, as their sign asserts, was right - and I would have joined the culinary majority!

Bottom line: if you have the chance, check out any of Luke's twelve New York City locations - you'll be glad you did!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

I had the crab roll for $13, we also ordered the trio which allows you to try all three of their rolls (shrimp, crab, lobster) and the regular lobster roll. The buns here are more like a Texas toast- super buttery and delicious and holds up well to the meat. I would say with the trio you aren't getting the full effect of the roll, the proportions are good but these rolls get better with each bite so ordering full size would be ideal!

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Mayonnaise. Hellmans. Literally tubs of it in sight stored up high by their heaters. I'm not even one of those mayo haters but the rolls had enough to sway even the least picky mayo people (like me).

This is what I saw, an empty restaurant, 4 employees, enough mayo to fill 5 huge stock pots and a whole lot of no productivity.

They had so much time on their hands, why wasn't the Mac n cheese hot? Or the bread crumbs baked, I've never had bread crumbs that are literal stale bread crumbs? Guess what the base for the Mac and cheese was..? Mayo. Absolutely no love in this food. Mayo does not equal love.

The rolls were basically pillsbury rolls that were slightly undercooked and although the texture was good, the crab itself would've been better if the mayo wasn't everywhere. The lobster n bay shrimp were mediocre at best. Can I get a lemon wedge?

this location (and all LL locations, really) has always tied together that fun, 5-star experience thanks to its friendly, chill personnel...which is kind of essential due to the long lines this location draws. i always order a trio with a half lobster and two half crabs (in lieu of a half shrimp), and they've always been willing to accommodate this change to the standard trio order without giving us a hard time or charging us extra (i've got receipts!). obviously the next part of this story is going to be about how they weren't willing to do so this time - which, while annoying, isn't the issue here or why i'm taking time to write this on a saturday morning. rather, it's how this request was handled by the store's manager in an altogether odd and unfriendly manner.

anyhow, the guy taking our order yesterday was most likely new and said they couldn't do the substitution, so we explained that they had always been willing to do the sub in the past and asked whether they could please do so this time. the guy then called over to someone in the back, after which point the manager saunters up, locking eyes with my husband, extending his hand, and deadpanning, ""Hi, I'm Sean. What is it that you want us to do."" in brief, we explained the situation, Sean informed us that we had likely never been given this accommodation and that previous LL cashiers had just been ringing everything up separately without us knowing. it seemed pointless to continue pressing the issue, so we asked them to punch our loyalty card, which led to another strange interaction in which Sean slowly took the card, skeptically read it as if he'd never seen one of these things before, and reluctantly gave us one punch on the card in spite of a total 3.5 rolls ordered. it was so weird and uncomfortable!!! then he refused to charge my two half crabs as a full crab, adding an additional couple bucks to LL's always egregiously high tab. again, not the end of the world, but seriously dude?? also - because Sean was the guy in charge of buttering the lobster/crab rolls in back, his brief interlude to come intimidate us over this dumb trio issue led him to butter the crap out of parts of our order, and then miss the butter entirely on others...so we didn't even have our typically delicious meal to retreat back to after this whole ridiculous episode :-(

i feel petty and absurd going into this level of detail in an online review about lobster rolls, but the point i'd like to convey - primarily to Luke's Lobster - is that a customer's simple act of asking for an accommodation on a menu item, and then being marginally persistent about it, somehow gave rise to the establishment's manager trying to engage in a full-on power struggle about it. why should you have to deal with that when you're paying $60 for a casual lunch? perhaps someone should speak to this guy about the appropriate way to deal with patrons in a customer-facing business, particularly when you're the manager of the store and set the tone for the rest of your staff.

bye for now, Luke's!",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I love lobster rolls, and this was fantastic.  With the buttery bread, I have to say that this was an adequate amount of ingredients.  I enjoyed it so much in fact that it was gone in 1 minute, so it felt like a great starter.  I anticipated getting another one, but I decided to chow down the chips to see where I was in terms of fullness.  Yes, I wish I could eat 2 of them, since they go by so fast. There was a long line, but it seemed worth it.  I would return.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

The Lobster roll was yummy, but on the smaller side. Good service though.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"OHHH MYYYY GOODNESSS!!!! This place is toooo legit!

So after a very eventful and hot/humid time going to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, my cousin wanted too take me to get some bomb ass pizza at Juliana's.

While we were waiting for her boyfriend to find a parking spot, we head to Luke's Lobster to split a Lobster Roll.

So then it happened... I took my first bite and it was like love at first bite.

The bread was delicious. They don't cheap you out on the Lobster. They actually use lobster through out the WHOLE sandwich. I was telling my cousin how tin Cali they call it a 'Lobster Roll' but it's only like 2 pieces of lobster and the rest is imitation crab. lol. And before I knew it, I killed it..... Totally forgetting that I was going to share with my cousin. LOL. SORRY CUZ!

Service: Really friendly. They let us stick our head into the window because the AC was blasting nice cold air. :)

Will I be back?? HELL YEAHHH!!! This place was so good! Like my friend Aimee A said, I WISH THIS PLACE WAS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA! But I will be back for sure... I miss new york already!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Who is Luke, and why does he make such good lobster? While we ponder those questions, you can stop by his location directly under the Brooklyn Bridge in the DUMBO section of Brooklyn.

This location is an outdoor food counter behind the main drag. Follow the signs for the delicious seafood. I had the Taste of Main which included three half rolls of lobster, crab, and shrimp. All were delicious, but the crab was a little more delicious than the others. The chips and soda were ok, but the cool seafood on a hot day was wonderful.

Love the Luke's Lobster chain. Their DUMBO location lacks indoor seating or seating of any kind, but the view is spectacular for to go orders. Keep Calm and Lobster On.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Updating my review!

I see a lot of things have changed since the last time I came to this particular location. They bought out that sandwich spot and have expanded their kitchen! Cool!!

They've added more seats, replaced old tables and they offer a loyalty card!

Should definitely offer some kind of citrus to go with the seafood or even hot sauce (not Sriracha).

Will keep coming back cause the location it's in is beautiful and I don't mind walking around with my shrimp roll in hand lol.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Let's get the complaints out of the way - the lobster rolls are expensive and not all that large. You should probably have known that before coming here, especially if you are reading this Yelp review.

Otherwise, really fantastic lobster roll. It's fresh and delicious. I certainly wish I could (afford to) eat 5 or 6 of them in a sitting. Considering it's fresh, Maine lobster - it just might be reasonable. Sometimes you have to splurge on a beautiful summer afternoon.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Well, to start we visited in the winter, so no real indoor seating. Adorable place and the food is good, but way overpriced. They serve you on a Trader Joe's toasted hot dog bun, but the lobster and crab were so cold. When you bite into the bun you are not expecting a cold mouthful of seafood. I recommend this place, but I would suggest that you go in the summer when you are hot and the cold lobster in the hot dog bun will taste refreshing",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I've been to multiple Luke's locations in the city, this Dumbo location has the worst lobster rolls.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Pretty good but extremely overpriced. Very convenient location, friendly staff, and the food was pretty good. If you aren't price sensitive, I'd say give it a shot.

Edit: After the ""Rewards member"" plug from the manager, I have amended my review from 4 stars to 3 stars. I was trying to be polite about the flavorless clean lobster I ate. I lived in Louisiana for 20 years and honestly cannot understand the hype about lobster in the northeast. The lobster meat was clean, which is extremely important, but it is essentially unseasoned. If you want good seafood (including lobster), travel to Louisiana and you'll see how it is supposed to taste. It is just a shame that people are eating that up north and thinking that is as good as it gets.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,Every time i come back to the east coast i can not resist this place!! Luke's lobster is one of the best lobster rolls i have had. Usually i just get the crab roll because crab is my favorite BUT I tried the trio this time and it was one of the best choices I've made. I did not think that the shrimp roll would be that great but this place continues to surprise me haha it has changed my mind about shrimp rolls forever and it is now my favorite roll to get at Luke's lobster. This is my first time at the DUMBO location and their stand is sort of hidden but right by the main road. The views from DUMBO are insane like the bridge never stops to amaze me. Overall i love this place and it has changed my mind on shrimp rolls forever hah,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,The items here are very overpriced compared to the portions they serve. Ordered the crab roll and new gland clam chowder. The crab roll was literally the size of a hotdog that you get from hotdog carts. The bun was toasted but the crab meat on the inside was cold. The crab roll tasted not bad but wasn't that great either... The New England clam chowder was very disappointing. Taste was below average and not creamy at all.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I honestly thought it was over-rated, which was very disappointing because I was excited for a delicious lobster roll. The lobster tasted a cold and bland and so did the crab. I also kept biting into pieces of shell .. I've had better lobster rolls before for sure .. I saw someone mention here that this location was the worst of Luke's Lobster .. maybe I would give another location a try, but I won't be coming back to this one for sure .",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,Definitely one of the better lobster rolls I've had. I loved that it wasn't saturated in dressing which has been my experience in the past with other rolls. The dressing was flavorful but subtle enough to let the freshness of the lobster shine through. Ample amount of lobster. The roll was buttery and crisp. Absolutely delicious. The shack is tucked away right under the Brooklyn bridge which I also loved.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"A very small lobster roll worth every bite and penny of $17!! Absolute deliciousness in your mouth. The bread seems like just any slice of bread but they grill it with so much buttery goodness and pepper and herbs. There is also so much lobster in the middle also. Every piece of lobster is ginormous so every bite you take into the roll guarantees a mouthful of lobster. You can also see them pour butter on top of the lobster part also. Best lobster roll I have every eaten. This location is nice also because it is an outdoorsy storefront where you can enjoy the view of the bridges.

The wait was quite long but it is something I would definitely wait for again. While you're waiting, you can also take pictures with claws and lobsters on posters they have hanging around.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"My first time having a lobster roll was in my early college years; a friend of mine brought me to the East Village location for dinner and it was almost like love at first bite. I'm still on the hunt to go out to Maine (or anywhere) to find the best tasting lobster roll! I'm a big seafood person so this is somethin I'd be super excited for.

From the memory of my first experience with Luke's, they're pretty consistent on taste. This time, I'm at their Dumbo location and it's just as I remembered. This location is like a small booth right under the Brooklyn Bridge. Seatings are outside, there's no indoor seating. The area is surrounded by a bunch of eateries. You have Julianna's and Grimaldi's right around the corner and along the water front, there's a bunch of food carts for snacking.

My boyfriend and I were in the area trying out Julianna's for pizza. After lunch, we wanted to walk around a bit to explore the area, it's both of our first times being in Dumbo. Despite just having lunch, I saw there was a Luke's Lobster and had to get a lobster roll ($18) for my boyfriend to try. My boyfriend have had a lobster roll from Maine and he mentioned how good it was so I wanted him to try Luke's to compare.

When I took a bite, it was just as I remembered like the first time. The bread is toasted nicely with butter, crispy on the outside but still some softness of the bread. The lobster meat was lovely, (they used lobster claws) nice savory and sweet taste of the lobster with some mayonaise and celery salt.

It was my boyfriend's turn, he took a bite and said it was good but wasn't as good as what he had back in Maine. For NYC, it's a pretty good lobster roll. His input is that I need to go to Maine to get that real good tasting lobster roll.

Personally, I love Luke's lobster. Might be a taste preference, but I think Luke's is better than Redhook lobster pound. For now, I'm good with Luke until the day I make a trip out to Maine.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Hands down BEST Lobster rolls around. I've tried many lobster rolls all around NYC and out of the country-- but nothing compares to Lukes so far.

The warm toasted garlic bread, with freshly shucked cold lobster, is the perfect combination. The lobster is topped with oregano, butter and lemon. It's divine!

They also offer other rolls and a trio pack for you to try. They have crab meat rolls and shrimp rolls. In the trio pack you can try all 3 rolls but miniature sized. ( Perfect for the indecisive person aka me. )

They have several locations throughout the boroughs of NYC so next time you pass by one, stop in and do your self a favor, you wont regret it!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I've been enjoying the lobster, crab, and shrimp rolls at DUMBO's branch of Luke's Lobster since it opened,...
Last summer, I went to a few open markets and had lobster rolls from 3 other,...""establishments""... I'm not gonna do that anymore. Luke's lobster rolls are generous and fresh,...zero overwhelming mayo something-somethings mixed in!

I went to a branch near Union Square abt a month ago.... the lobster was Ice cold and although I know they're served 'chilled'... I was startled by the more extreme- err,...icy nature of the roll I got... I walked back to the store to speak with the woman behind the counter....which was not received well... I definitely wont be returning to that branch of LL!

More good stuf---
My sister came to visit me 2 days ago, and I kinda dragged her to DUMBO's LL,...
The ladies on staff were AMAZING, Friendly, Knowledgeable, (my sis had lots of questions) we decided to get the TRIO as it was my sister's first time there...
It-Was-Sooo Yummy!! Buttery warm toasty blanket cradling the lobster, crab, and shrimp,... so delish!!
AND they gave us soup samples! Omg! I need LL soup too!!
Big Props to the ladies working that day!

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Luke's at Brooklyn Bridge Park is closed for the season. It's a small hut, very shack-like. They take orders at the window that faces the Brooklyn Bridge.
The rolls are all Maine-style - served chilled on a buttered, toasted New England style split-top bun with a little mayo, lemon butter & spices
The last time I was here, we ordered the:

Taste of Maine ($21) - half shrimp roll, half lobster roll, half crab roll. It comes with a drink, chips or slaw, and a pickle.
- The lobster was no doubt the best one of the trio. Delightful claw meat, sweet & tender.
- The crab was nice and chunky, not too shredded up.
- The shrimp was okay.
All three were dressed well, not swimming heavily in mayo. The buttery buns had a light crunch to them. Even though the half rolls are small, I appreciate that they try to stuff the bread with lots of filling.

Small cup of New England Clam Chowder ($6) - includes oyster crackers. It was a windy day, so the hot soup felt necessary, especially with 3 cold, but delicious sandwiches. It was nice to chomp on a snack and watch the sunset over the bridges.

I like their rather simple menu, mainly just rolls and sides. I found the prices reasonable since seafood tends to be on the more expensive side.
There are no seats at this location, except for a couple of standing tables. This makes it a little difficult to drink soup, but it's not a big deal since rolls are eaten with your hands.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Luke's is located in Brooklyn's ""DUMBO"" neighborhood (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass), and the restaurant is, literally, almost directly under said bridge.  Their specialty is the lobster roll, a ubiquitous sandwich available across New England and the northeast.

The sandwich is basically a piece of Texas toast, filled with a mild salad of lobster, chopped celery and mayonnaise.  They also offer chowder and a selection of microbrews to quench your thirst. There is a miniscule indoor seating area, with an assortment of picnic tables scattered around outside.

If you are looking for a relaxing, sit-down experience, keep searching; window service only here...but the locals didn't seem to mind.

I have tried their Lobster and their Crab roll & they're amazing! The bread slightly toasted and is very buttery and then combined with the juicy and flavorful lobster -- it's just delicious! Most places that sell lobster roll are very expensive with very little lobster meat but Luke's Lobster offers a generous amount of lobster so you get at least 2 to 3 pieces of lobster in every bite!

It is located in a very crowded but nice area of DUMBO by the water so it's a great place to relax and enjoy a lobster roll while sitting by the water, breathing in the fresh air. It is better to enjoy your lobster, crab or shrimp roll on the benches by the water rather than their minimal seating area around them.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,Ran into this place since I was out near the Brooklyn Bridge. I normally wouldn't stop by because I thought it would be an overpriced tourist trap. Reviewing the price of the lobster roll ($18) it seemed about average from what I've seen. Ordered it as a combo with chips and a drink for about $23. Food was ready immediately and I was good to go. Luckily they have some tables outside right beside the building and actually an indoor dining area and restroom through the back door. The lobster roll I got had the mayo omitted (mayo is gross) but it still had butter and their special seasoning. I was kinda surprised that the lobster was cold since when it's in butter it's normally hot. It was fine though and tasted good. The roll looks small but they do pack quite a bit of lobster to satisfy most people.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"*REVIEW 1500*

$20 bucks gets you at Luke's Lobster:

(1) Lob-sta roll
(1) choice of soda
(1) choice of chips

This is straight from Luke's Website:

Each morning lobstermen haul traps from the open seas, and they're taken from the dock to Luke's seafood company, where we steam them, pick them, and pack the meat in protective bags, then send them south to Luke's Lobster.

The reason why I'm adding this little footnote? I was with a HATER of Lukes! He said the best he's ever had was in Boston. Big Shmeal I say. I like Luke's, I like the price point and the lobster taste fresh. Its not drowning in mayo, its a tasty lobster treat.

Also, this place is actually a stand and not a sit down restaurant.

I can never understand why people would wait in line for Grimaldis. For hours!! Pass on that stupid azz line, get a lobster roll and enjoy the Brooklyn Waterfront. (Trust me, if you want OG pizza then go to Patsy's in Harlem with no line)

The star of the show was the roll.  The crab tasted fine (to me, I didn't feel like it was super sweet) but there were plenty on the roll.  My friend said the shrimp was okay but nothing to be excited over.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"This place was such a let-down. A few highlights of our experience:
1. They ran out of lobster. We waited around till they re-stocked the lobster to order.
2. Somehow our order for 2 people was $55... outrageous and unnecessary for fast food.
3. I ordered a salad and cup of water. I received a ready-made salad that was thrown straight from the fridge into the to-go bag. My order was missing utensils, dressing, and the cup of water that I ordered.
4. They did not include 2 desserts that we ordered.
5. They ran out of salad after I ordered mine, so my friend went elsewhere to get food that isn't drowning in butter.

I wish I didn't see the sign though because I was a little disappointed with my rolls. It basically lacked taste and flavor to me. I never got my slaw. They forgot to give it to me when I took it on the go.

That confused me for a bit... you might look at the building and think ""No, there can't possibly be anything back there""... but you'd be wrong cuz that's where their takeout window is.  Someone needs to teach their marketing guy a thing or 2 about the power of having your business visible to the general public... but I digress.  Onto the food:

This summer I've been having my fill of lobster rolls, so instead, I decided to try the crab roll.  I watched with initial dismay as the attendant toasted the tiniest bun I've ever seen and thought ""Well there goes $14 down the drain""... however, when it came to stuffing in the crab meat... that bad boy was positively overflowing, so I was relieved.  I'm not sure what seasonings they put on this, but I loved it.  It was not sweet like a lobster roll is.  It's more savory and textured... a definite win.

Now I have to go scope the other lobster joints for crab rolls too for comparison...",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Great tourist location. Had the lobster sandwich and half lobster tail. The sandwich was just toasted white bread curled like a taco and filled with cold lobster. Not much seasoning. Just tasted white bread and lobster. Food was decent, I guess I was expecting more from world famous.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,My husband and I got the lobster grilled cheese. It was soooo delicious. So much flavor! The cheese and bread are paired perfectly with the lobster. My dad got the lobster roll and he really enjoyed that too. The lobster roll is definitely pricey and a little small but still good.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,Friendly service with a great view of the Brooklyn bridge. The food was good - although the crab roll was my least favorite. The corn & lobster chowder was good as well. Definitely worth coming here to grab a quick bite when visiting the Brooklyn bridge.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Luke's Lobster was everything I had hoped it would be! My mom and I went here specifically for the Lobster Mac n' Cheese, and it was absolutely delicious! I only wish the serving was larger.

The seating area inside is very small. Fortunately we went at a slow time and easily found seats. There is more seating right outside and you can find seating on the Promenade after getting your food. That is if the weather is pretty.

I would definitely go back just to have more of that amazing Lobster Mac n' Cheese!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Chunky. Lemon butter. Lobster roll. So GOOD, but quite pricey- $19 in total.

My first lobster roll experience here was spent on the waterfront in plain view of the NY skyline and Brooklyn Bridge with Lady Liberty in the distance. I definitely recommend this place!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Lobster Roll with no Mayo was Finger Licking good. I skeptical  thinking  it was going to be so super tiny and not fulfilling.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"My boyfriend and I spotted Luke's Lobster one night while walking and decided to try it out. The lobster roll is amazing. It's simple, and the seasoning doesn't overpower the taste of the lobster. The lobster was fresh, as well. I went back and ordered another to bring home. It is just so yummy. One bite and I was hooked!!!!!! The prices are reasonable. The cashier was friendly. The service was quick.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"If you are visiting New York, this place might seem like a good place to hit up to quench your lobster roll craving. I would avoid it. Pretty blatant tourist trap. I ordered their special trio; a lobster roll, shrimp roll and crab roll. Both the shrimp roll and crab roll were too salty. If you have a heart condition...avoid those. The lobster roll was good though. The bread is soft and buttery, they should just sell that by itself...but not at the prices that they charge. For $20, you get 3 ~3"" rolls that might last you two bites if you're lucky. Make sure to have a backup food place bookmarked cause you will be going home hungry otherwise. Maybe hit up that Shake Shack across the street.

TL;DR Decent rolls that are a bit too salty, overpriced and small",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Fantastic view. Walk off of the Brooklyn bridge and got to this place. For Noah's ark which was about $46 for a boatload of food. Delicious. A little pricey but well worth it.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Ultra fresh & all the sources/purveyors are listed on the boards.
Limited menu. Cape Cod chips & Dr. brown's soda round out the experience.
Not the biggest rolls we've had BUT the quality is excellent & proportion is fair for the average price around $14.
We had the Jacob's crab claw appetizer, two crab rolls & 1 lobster roll.
Beautifully buttery grilled split top rolls compliment the tender fresh seafood slathered in clarified butter & a sprinkling of celery salt.
Outdoor seating almost under the Manhattan Bridge along the Hudson.
A great stop for lunch if you dig seafood & dining outdoors.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Literally the worst place on earth. I almost laughed when I was handed my shrimp roll which had been pre-prepared and was the size of my hand (I'm 5ft1' so my hands are fairly tiny). A pile of cold shrimp you usually buy in a tub from the shop, in one slice of fried bread. It's just a joke. They were out f the draught beer and our chosen can; the one I got, along with the shrimp roll amounted to $17. That's so ludicrous. The roll was seasoned with white pepper- as if the lid fell off and the whole shaker dumped out on top of it. The view from the seating area is of concrete, bins and cars. There are so many better places to enjoy in dumbo.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Visited Luke's today during my lunch break. I got the combo which is $21 for a lobster roll, drink, pickle and chips or slaw.  The lobster roll has big luscious chunks of fresh Maine lobster. The roll is just warmer than room temperature because it's wrapped in warm buttered Texas toast. There is just a light thin layer of mayo that makes it go down easy. The slaw is fresh and crispy. My one gripe is that it is a bit small for the price, especially considering it is not a sit down restaurant.
They have a loyalty card, but it's a bit hard to reach 10 purchases here for the price.
If you want ambiance, walk into the park and take a seat by the water.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

I tried Luke's Trio with the shrimp, lobster and crap.....first of all because I'm greedy;  second because I wanted to get a taste of the main attractions lol. I already love seafood so I thank god everyday for not being allergic (I feel bad for those that are) but I initially thought to myself this wasn't going to be anything spectacular. I was wrong! I was happy with each bite I took .

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"If you breathlessly read every single word I write (as I can only assume you do), you already know that I'm an enormous fan of Luke's Lobster.

Well, if you take their wonderfully fresh seafood (with the simple, impeccable preparation they are justifiably known for) and you move it into the middle of a beautiful park, my opinion is not likely to change. Even if some old lady decides she doesn't have to follow the basic laws of society, and can cut anyone she wants on a whim because her time on earth is coming to an end.*

This is the same delicious lobster or shrimp roll you are used to getting from Luke and his lovely staff, but in the location they were always meant to have.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Oh how I wish we had this in San Diego!  

My family and I bookmarked a bunch of foodie spots before heading to New York.  This was one of the places that we did not want to miss.  We headed towards the Brooklyn Bridge that day and took a bunch of photos at the Brooklyn Bridge Park.  After our ""photo shoot,"" we looked for Luke's Lobster.  It's kind of tucked away behind the ice cream shop.  If you can't find it, go past the ice cream shop towards Water St facing Shake Shack, look to your left and you should see a brick building.  This is Luke's Lobster.

SERVICE
The guys at the register were friendly and patient with us as we tried to decide on what to order because everything looked so good!  We ordered our food and anxiously waited.

FOOD is BOMBDIGGITTY!
-  Lobster Grilled Cheese Combo ($13 + $3):  I shared this with my Mom.  This included the Lobster Grilled Cheese, a pickle slice, coleslaw (or chips), and your choice of drink.  Every bite was savory and had big chunks of lobster in it.  You can tell that the lobster is fresh fresh fresh!  The cheese didn't overpower the lobster which I really liked.
-  Lobster Roll ($16):  Small in size, but big on flavor.  This was my first time ever having a lobster roll so any other place I try now will have some stiff competition.  

OVERALL
Definitely give this spot a try!  Order your food and hang out at the Brooklyn Bridge Park and enjoy the scenery!  And afterwards, stop by the ice cream shop on the pier.  Overall, this was a great visit.  I highly recommend!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

While eating, my friend and I were so amazed by the food that we didn't say a word to one another. We were involved with enjoying our meal.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"My first time trying a lobster roll, crab roll and a shrimp roll all at once. The portion is small for the price you pay but it's so worth it. The seafood tastes fresh and they put it inbetween a buttery roll. I wouldn't recommend the shrimp roll though.

The food is delicious. But the portion size is for my son. Dont get me wrong, I dont mind paying for good food, but I had to order to regular lobster rolls for myself and I still wasn't full. The ""regular"" lobster rolls are TINY. Wife got the trio and she was disappointed also. Portion size is my biggest gripe, but flavor is good.

Perfectly tucked into DUMBO, this location has plenty of outdoor seating and space to walk around Brooklyn with your lobster roll.

Keep in mind, this location has only a small out door seating area, but there are countless spots in the park along the water to take and enjoy the rolls. Enjoy lunch with a view, why not?

Lobster roll was good, but golly-gee-pajama pants are they expensive - $17! Their clam chowder was that I really enjoyed the most.

I had a little trouble finding this place at first as a visiting Californian, but thank goodness for Google maps. Now on to the food - the lobster rolls are absolutely AMAZING!

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,I got the Luke's trio like I always do whenever I go to a Luke's lobster. The shrimp was actually the best of three.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,$18 for a lobster roll with chips pickle and a water.... A joke right ? Ive been wanting to come since last summer... And i finally made it and boy am I disappointed ! First off its so hidden. Its behind some place called No. 7 Sub. Now the food... Looked great but it was so small. Like dont come here hungry. It was a light snack. $18 for a snack is alot and i LIVE IN NY ! And i brought my great grandparents and they had the Noah's ark. I know its half rolls but geesh they were small. They seemed to like it tho. My grandma said the coleslaw wasnt good. I wont be back. Im heartbroken.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I've been reading lobster was cheap this summer due to warmer weather so lobster lover rejoice! Errh sort of... We tried the Brooklyn location. This lobster shack kind of hidden behind the sandwich shop but follow the buoys. It was a great day to have a picnic along the water and enjoy the view.

We tried the Noah's ark to try all the sampling for two. That is two 'half' sandwiches of shrimp, crab and lobster with a choice of drinks and chips. All the toppings were held in a warm toasted bun that is slightly crispy on the outside. The lobster was brimming with claw meat. The crab equally so. The shrimp is the small variety type wasn't our favorite but pretty good.

When it comes to value let's say two halves don't make a whole unless it is a really small 'whole' sandwich.  As a treat along the water on a bright Sunday day during Dumbo Arts Festival  yes but it isn't economically viable all the time. I guess even with the gluttony of lobster there someone is still cracking all those claws for the meat without the mess we can all enjoy.  The price of convenience.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Their lobster roll comes with mayo butter and seasoning, pretty standard, good flavor and you can count on heaping chunks of meat.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"After walking around all day, we headed to Luke's after crossing the Brooklyn Bridge. It was a little hard to find, it's on the back end of a small hut-like building. There were a few signs out directing people where to go; now that you know that, you can keep an eye out for them.

Tempted by much of the menu, we each ordered the Taste of Maine. The Taste comes with a half lobster roll, half crab roll, and half shrimp roll along with chips and a drink. All of the rolls are cold or mayo based, in other words, there's no option of a hot lobster roll. Of the rolls, the lobster was my favorite. It was a solid showing; I've had better, but it's still quite good. The half rolls are a bit on the small side.

I'm not sure if this place is open year-round, but I would find dining challenging in colder months. There is only outdoor seating and a few tables between Luke's and the other shop sharing the building. On a nice day, you can take your meal over to the park only steps away.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"It was the first truly beautiful day of the year, so my family and I took a trip to Brooklyn Bridge Park with our 4 year old daughter. We got hungry, so we decided to check out the Luke's Lobster window.

However, it seems like everyone and their mother had the same idea. There was a line when we got there and at some point they even sold out of lobster (luckily, after my wife and I got our lobster and shrimp rolls).

Wow, Luke's must be a lot more popular than I thought. I know this happens a lot in Austin, Texas with their best BBQ joints, but I had no idea that Brooklynites loved their lobster rolls so much to clean out the place.

There was a bit of wait after ordering, but I know that happens when a place is really popular. I've waited longer for Shake Shack. At least at Luke's, they went around and gave out drinks to people who were waiting a while.

The lobster roll was bountiful with fresh buttery lobster, rested in a tosted bun, and seasoned very very well. The treat cost me 19 dollars and change after tax, and I'd say it was worth every dime! The woman working behind the counter informed my friend and I that they would soon introduce lobster macaroni and cheese to the menu, and I'm ready for it!

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I don't know Luke, but he manages to make what is likely the best lobster roll in the city. The Connecticut style rolls (warm with butter) aren't huge, but are packed with delicious and tender lobster meat. The bun can make or break a lobster roll and happily these are made on a crispy roll which handles the lobster well. As much as I like the roll, I think the grilled cheese served only during the winter is even better. The bread isn't quite as good as the roll, though still good. However, the gooey mixture of cheese and sublime lobster meat is heavenly. Inside is very tight with only about 6 bar seats, so be prepared to take it to go.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Luke's lobster has phenomenal lobster rolls. It's the real deal. The roll is nicely toasted and loaded with juicy and plump lobster  meat. There's no extra filling that other places tend to add like lettuce, etc. the best part is that it's not lathered with mayo so it doesn't feel too heavy. I was also pleasantly surprised by how good the clam chowder tasted. It was loaded with tender pieces of clam and had a nice balance of potatoes. We also had the crab roll which was OK but not my favorite. I'm not a huge fan of crabs but the crab was definitely fresh, it needed a bit more flavor to it though. I would definitely come back again for the lobster rolls and clam chowder.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"Hands down the best lobster roll I have eaten. I am not even a lobster fan.... Although this was probably the most expensive roll I have ever paid for but its ok, it was totally worth every penny I spent ($20ish for the combo). It was so fat and juicy, and really stuffed. The roll itself was small, but the meat inside was filling. I didn't really like the slaw that much, but I never liked slaw to being with, but its alright, the lobster made up for it. The location is behind some sandwich shop, but I think they're remodeling or something..

There isnt much to expect with the portions. I've tried other decently portioned rolls but do not taste as good as Luke's.  One of the distinct differences that's worthy mentioning though is the perfectly tossed buttery buns they use for the rolls.

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I've been meaning to try out a lobster roll from Luke's and was pleasantly surprised to discover this new location while walking around in DUMBO! They recently opened on Memorial Day and it's definitely a welcome addition to the growing scene in this area of Brooklyn.

I love love love the location. If you are familiar with the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory, this new Luke's Lobster is right next to it. Many options for eating your food: ample chairs and tables to sit at, or take your lobster roll on a stroll by the waterfront, or the grassy fields for a mini picnic.

The roll itself was divine. It's a bit pricey at $16 a pop, but the roll itself is overflowing with big juicy pieces of lobster. The bread was nice and perfectly toasted. It was smaller than I had hoped it would be, but the deliciousness and the generous helping of lobster made up for it.

If I had lots of dough in the bank I would definitely come back to Luke's again, but for now it will be saved for a treat on special occasions!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I love lobster rolls but I hate paying $15+ for a scoop of lobster-studded mayo on a cold hot dog bun. So I breathed a sigh of hangry relief when I finally tried Luke's and saw the healthy heap of fresh lobster lightly coated with mayo on a thick, golden, buttery roll that resembles Texas toast more than hot dog bun. It's the best lobster roll I've tried in NY (2nd place goes to Ed's Lobster Bar, 3rd to Red Hook). The shrimp roll is pretty good too, and half the price of lobster. I wasn't a fan of the crab roll which I found tasteless, but I'm not a fan of crab in general. This location is tucked away, which I like, and the employees are nice.

Many of the low star reviews are gripes about the size of the rolls. Obviously it's not a Subway footlong but I think the saying ""it's not the size of the wave, it's the motion of the ocean"" applies here. The lobster and the bread are both so rich and buttery, a couple of bites will fill you up pretty good. If you want a big sandwich, go to Seven Subs on the other side. If you want a lobster roll, come here and try not to be stingy about it.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Luke's Lobster Brooklyn Bridge Park,"I have been wanting to try Luke's lobster roll for a while. It was great they had a stand in the DUMBO park and no lines!

I liked the fact that their buns are toasted with butter. Makes it taste extra delicious and I like warm bread. I had the regular lobster roll. The roll was filled with alot of lobster meat and I like that they didn't use alot of mayo. I like it simple and not drench with sauce. I also got the Taste of Maine which had half of a lobster roll, shrimp roll and crab roll. They were all very good. The shrimp roll was very flavorable. The Taste of Maine comes with soda and a bag of Cape Cod Kettle Cooked Chips.

I would come back to eat again when I am craving for lobsters, but it is quite expensive. Lobsters are only $4/pound in chinatown, so I can technically make alot of lobster rolls for the price I paid for one lobster roll at Luke's, which was around $15.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

We were there in February, so I am not sure they are fully reopened, but don't worry, if not you can get take a way. Grubhub delivers and so do others.

The Pork meat soup dumplings are amazing and one bowl can fill you, so share, that you can try other items. Their rice is so good.

We had the Pork Meat Soup Dumplings and a Scallion Pancake for appetizers and both were excellent. We even managed to get the Soup Dumplings home intact (though we accidentally punctured a couple of them In serving them). Though they probably would have been even better if we had been able to eat them in the restaurant, they were still very much a treat.

For our main dish, we had the Peking Duck and it was also very well done. It came with the usual accompaniments (wraps, scallions, cucumbers and hoisin sauce) and was perfect for sharing.

The service was friendly and efficient.  They have a table setup right inside the door and the food was well packaged for travel.

Joe's Shanghai,"Insta@dish_360

The Good: We wanted the best soup dumplings and both Google and Yelp pointed us to Joe's Shanghai. We got the crab and pork meat soup dumplings. Okay, so basically it's a dumpling that has your protein of choice and when you bite down the soup pours out. Absolutely. Frikkin. Delicious.

We also had the scallion pancake which was crisp and addicting. Texturally, they complimented the dumplings and didn't feel too ""heavy.""

The Bad: Cash only. NBD they had an ATM on site. Also, the wait staff is not pleasant by any means  not a deal breaker for us. I saw other reviews that echoed this sentiment. Honestly, I don't care as much about service as a lot of people do. I'd go back for the dumplings as long as the quality in the kitchen held up. ‍ I'm also not a fan of the shared tables. We just aren't social enough to want to share a table with a bunch of people we don't know but that's personal preference.

Aftermath: This isn't an intimate date night spot. We tried the items they're known for and we left happy. We'd be back but I'm not sure if I'd explore the rest of the menu. It's not a place I would care to sit and spend a lot of time at. I'd eat what I knew was going to be executed well and then leave.

Joe's Shanghai,"Honestly, pretty average Xiao Long Bao, I'm not sure why its so popular here. We ordered that and the crispy noodles with meat, veggies and gravy sauce over it, and both dishes were pretty mediocre.

The soup dumplings were hot, which was nice, and came with the typical sauce, but overall there was nothing too special about them. They tasted like the kind you could get at any soup dumpling place, there was no need to wait in a giant line just to try it here.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"I Never wanted to try Joe's Shanghai based on a hunch it's american (white people) asian food. Well, the restaurant was just around where I was, so why not?

We ordered 2 dishes : fried dumplings and pork soup dumplings, solely because that's what they are ""famous"" for. Big disappointment. The dumpling skin is fine, not too thick, and the soup was just fine, but the meat was lacking of almost any real depth of flavour. Usually fried dumplings are hard to get wrong in any other restaurant because they are so basic, yet joe's Shanghai failed on both. Both dishes had almost no flavour.

We had to ask for chili paste/hot sauce, and even their hot oil chili paste also had almost no taste LOL. Sorry, this one is all hype and there are better Shanghainese restaurants in NYC

Service just hit or miss. Its not bad but it's not great. It's asian restaurant in chinatown anyway. And they put 15% ""service charge"" automatically on the check. I just pitied them and add $1 extra tip on top of the service charge for $16 food ( before tax and tip ) so total I gave the mediocre service 25%.

I live in NYC so I'm not a big fan when they put the tip automatically for party of 2. My assumption maybe is tourists' area and generally they don't tip. Oh well....

Not recommend this place. Unless u want to eat mediocre food. For Xiao long bao I suggest "" Nang Xiang Xiao long bao"" in flushing",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Well Joe's congratulations on the new location! It's more accessible, bigger, brighter, and a huge upgrade looks wise than its original location. Although I'll surely miss the original spot because it had so much character! If you want to beat the crowds, try getting there around 11-11:30ish, which we did and our party of 8 waited less than 20 minutes.

New spot, same menu, same prices (surprising). Any trip to NYC meant a stop for XLBs at Joe's. At the new location, these are still really good! Definitely worth a try if you are a fan of XLBs.

What was disappointing was that the fried rice and the green beans don't have the same flavor. The fried rice used to be bright and moist. This visit  it was darker and dry.  Which is sad because I used to love their fried rice. The green beans also took a step back, leaving me wondering, where'd the flavor go??

Maybe the need time to break in the new kitchen, but until then, I can only remember the memories of what used to be remarkable",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Ended up getting the vegetable dumplings and F2 Seafood Sautéed flat noodles.

For sure get the soup dumplings! It comes out in a steaming basket and is super hot so make sure to let it cool a bit.

This place has a huge line - I was here at 9:30 pm on Saturday and waited 15-20 minutes for a table. You might end up getting seated with another party if you have fewer people.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"The staff did not pay attention or come to your table unless you called for them. They stood around until they were called for. Even if you were ready to order and you looked like you are ready to order, they did not go over to you unless you called them over.

I was okay with sharing a table since it's often done in Chinese restaurants. But usually, there is a seat in between you and the separate party. We were elbow to elbow on a Tuesday afternoon and each time the large group spun the rotating tray or turntable in the middle, it would bump something. I sat with a seat in between at first and they were very insisted on having me move over (told me 4 times lol) and I eventually did. Turns out, they planned on putting another group of 2 at the same table, which now consisted of 3 groups (2 groups of 2 and a group of 6). This was my first experience at a restaurant sitting elbow to elbow with strangers when there were more than enough EMPTY tables for us to have sat a seat apart, more than enough tables for each group to have had our own tables. Was not the communal seating I expected or have always experienced.

The pork soup dumpling tasted homemade, but the same usual filling that other restaurants and stores sell. Still delicious soup dumplings. I order Szechuan food for the spicy kick, I could not taste the spice, but I saw a small amount of Szechuan sauce. Tasted like any other beef noodle soup.

tl;dr - overhyped, most likely won't visit anymore and if I do, its a no to sharing a table. (They don't usually ask you to share if its a group that fits their open table sizes; they have tables for groups of 2,4, and 10)",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"What happened to Joe shanghai? This used to be my go-to place for soup dumplings in Chinatown but it recently moved to a new location nearby. The decor is much nicer and the space is bigger but everything else went downhill.

Our soup dumplings came out first. We had a order of the pork soup dumplings and a order of the crab and pork soup dumplings. They were filled with plenty of soup inside and the flavor was good. However, the skin of the dumpling was a bit too thick and overpowered the filling.

Throughout my whole dining experience here, the service was odd and unorganized. Before we even had a chance to look through the menu, a server was standing behind us waiting to take our order. After we ordered our food, we asked for a cup of tea but yet they came back with a plate of cold chicken instead that we didn't order. When we were almost done with our meal, we inquired about one of the missing items we ordered earlier and he told us he didn't put the order through. Why did he say okay when we placed the order then? They also put a vegetarian noodle dish on our table but another waiter rushed over to take it back since it didn't belong to us. We ordered the beef pan fried noodles. When it finally arrived, the noodles were nice and crispy and there was a good variety of ingredients inside. However, we thought the dish was way too salty!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This was our first time eating in Chinatown and it was a good stop.

The process of getting a table is a bit hectic and unorganized. They give you a number and an approximate wait time. Since ours was 1.5 hours, we decided to leave for about 45 minutes. Based on a lot of people doing this, it seems like we probably could have been seated while we were gone if we hadn't left. After getting back we waited about 20-30 minutes before being seated.

Onto the food.. it's important to know that it's cash only, but they have an ATM there if you don't come prepared.

We got scallion pancakes and pork soup dumplings for appetizers. I wasn't impressed with the scallion pancakes. The soup dumplings, as expected, were the star of the entire meal. I've only had them elsewhere once before, but this time I came prepared and figured out how to eat them before we came. I wasn't impressed with previous soup dumplings, but these ones are amazing. Make sure to get them.

For entrees, a few of us split the Shanghai Flat Noodles, the Singapore Chow Mei Fun, and the Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup. We really enjoyed everything. I was probably most impressed by the soup.

I definitely thought it was worth the wait to come here. I'd recommend just staying there and waiting since the wait will probably be shorter than advertised.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's shanghai is a solid chinese restaurant but honestly the xiao long bao was not that amazing in my opinion. Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by xiao long bao from the streets of Shanghai, but these were nowhere near what they were hyped up to be. The XLB had more soup/juice than any others I've had in the US, but I felt like the flavor was sort of average. Better than Din Tai Fung for sure though (but then again, I think DTF is like a 2/5 lol)

But 4 stars because despite it not living up to hype, this place still has great food and is not one of those ridiculously overpriced asian restaurants. They give big portions and their prices are super reasonable given how famous they are. Aside from one order of XLB, my friend and I got a beef fried rice which was delicious, and we were actually struggling so hard to finish it.

Moreover, the service is one of the best I've experienced at a Chinese restaurant -- not that I really care about the service at Chinese restaurants (because usually there is an inverse relationship between quality of service and quality of food at these places haha), but it was impressive. Also, lots of great dessert places within walking distance in Chinatown!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"These soup dumplings are probably the only reason I'd move from California to freezing NY!! I'd give this place more than 5 stars if I could!!

Came here Saturday at 1pm and the wait was maybe ~15-20min for a party of 4. We ordered the crab with pork meat soup dumpling and the pork meat soup dumpling. They were bothhhh so good. Soupy, hot, flavorful, and delicious! I'd add more adjectives if my vocabulary was better. If I had any slight preference, it'd be the regular pork soup dumpling because it's a little cheaper...meaning I can eat more dumplings. The crab one also had a crab flavor so idk how much of those I can eat in one go.

My family also ordered the Shanghai Noodle Soup. I only had a sip of soup but my first impression was it's oily. We also got the Jajiangmein....which no one wanted to finish. I'd recommend skipping these two and just ordering the soup dumplings.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"I went here with a friend at around 2pm on a Tuesday and there were people waiting outside. We got a number and the hostess said that it would be about a 45 minute wait. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes around anytime. We decided to walk around and went to Tiger Sugar, which is close by. By the time we got back I think our number was passed but it was fine. She told us to go inside and wait on the line to be called. After about 10 minutes we were seated. The new location is very modern. The tables could be bigger. When you sit down they bring you tea and water.

We ordered the Pork Friend Dumplings ($7.95), which were very good and came with 8 dumplings. Of course we ordered their famous Pork Soup Dumplings ($7.95). It comes with 8 and they are my top 2 favorite soup dumplings in Manhattan Chinatown. They are large and delicate so be careful when picking them up. The broth is plentiful and expect it to fill your whole spoon. We got an order of General Tso Chicken ($17.95), which was perfectly crispy with a little spice. Chicken Fried Rice ($10.25), which is exactly what you want in fried rice. The bowl was never-ending and we were able to take some home.

This place is cash only so be sure to stop at the multiple banks on your way to the restaurant. This place is pricier than most in Chinatown, but if you are looking for quality I recommend trying it out.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Went to the newly relocated Joe's at 46 Bowery tonight for their grand reopening. I've been coming to Joe's since they first opened at Pell Street as a child with my family. Tonight we were surprised at the upgraded restaurant and decor, a big change from the dingy restaurant we've been going to for 20+ years. Everything is new and cleaner looking and the high ceilings and decorative wood decor make this place much more comfortable. Gone are the majority of the large tables which often had   four or more different parties crammed in, replaced by more sensible square tables of 2 or 4 for a more private dining experience. Gone are also the opportunities to chat with tourists and reach across the table to share a bite or two of each other's dish.

Is it better? Hard to say. It's definitely more comfortable and LOOKS cleaner. The soup dumplings, the ones we've been eating for 20+ years and what defined my idea of a soup dumpling growing up, has changed somewhat. The skin is thicker (though I have argued it has been thicker for a few years now), the broth thinner with less lip sticking collagen and fat, and the overall soup dumpling (all 4 of the orders we placed) was lukewarm at best, not the same tongue scalding hot as they were at Pell Street. Not sure if this was an opening night fluke or if this will be permanent. Prices are the same as the Pell Street location as it should be since Joe's recently went through significant price hikes a few years ago bringing a regular soup dumpling from $4.95 to $7.95.

Scallion pancake also had doubled in price but not quantity or quality and while the fried rice remains the same price, it looks like they changed to smaller serving plates. The szechuan beef noodle soup, never actually spicy, has been put into a larger bowl now. I asked for them to make it extra spicy to get a hint of spice but even that came with a touch of off-putting sweetness. Veggies, particularly snow pea leaves, are deep fried and extremely overpriced for the portion. Recommend everyone stay far away from the vegetables section and eat those elsewhere.

Overall the new location looks nice but was not impressed with tonight's soup dumplings or most of the other food. Hope it is just a fluke as they are getting used to the new space and kitchens.

P. S. Mandatory tip has now increased from 15% to 18% regardless of party size. Service has improved slightly. Tea and oranges are still free (for now). CASH ONLY",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's Shanghai is the spot you bring your friends who are visiting NYC -- total tourist spot. That being said, the quality of the food does not disappoint and it's overall a stellar experience.

The location has moved from Pell St. to Bowery so trade the older, kinda funny (XLB + vinegar) smelling space for a new modern, clean look. It's in prime location and during rush hours it'll most definitely attract an impressive crowd.

Must orders:

- Scallion pancake
- Shanghai fried flat noodles
- XLBs! pork... try the crab too!

You can get most of the standard banquet-style Chinese foods here... it's all solid. Don't forget to add an overpriced veggie -- gotta get that fiber!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

We ordered a few things to share, including the steamed pork dumplings and the Xi Long Bao (steamed soup dumplings). The steamed pork dumplings, despite being $10, really mimicked the ones you could get in a bulk bag at the grocery store. Served with vinegar, it didn't taste bad, but it definitely wasn't super fresh nor mindblowing. I will admit, the soup dumplings were far better and definitely the redeeming factor. They were massive in size and were piping hot and fresh.

Joe's Shanghai,"3.75/5
One of my last stops before the quarantine. Good enough to get my Chinese fix before I'm locked in. Chinatown was already pretty quiet by the time I visited so we had no wait despite coming on a Saturday night at 7pm. The restaurant was still pretty packed though. Service isn't super friendly but they got us everything we needed so no complaints there. Very clean and a comfortable dining experience if you don't speak the language (aka it's more tourist friendly than some other spots in Chinatown).

For our meal my friend and I got the following:

1) Pork XLB: TON of soup and very thin skin. Two of my top requirements. Plus they held up very well. My only gripe is that the filling's flavor isn't as good as other spots. It's still delicious but felt like it was missing something to make it a bit lighter (4.5/5)

2) Crispy Whole Fish w/ Garlic Sauce: Really nice flaky fish. Sauce was a bit on the salty side and fairly garlicky but one note. Solid but no urge to order this again (3.5/5)

3) Seafood Fried Rice Cake: Usually a pretty easy dish to make at home so I have slightly higher expectations at a restaurant but nothing special. Seafood wasn't too chewy and there was a good amount of it. Rice cakes were cut a bit thicker than I like. Flavor was also very one note. Not bad but also no desire to order this again (3.25/5)

Overall, I enjoyed my meal here and if you're coming back the XLB is definitely the item to get. But the prices are steeper, there's probably gonna be a wait, and the other items are just alright. So in general I'd probably opt for Shanghai Dumpling instead.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"There is absolutely nothing that is eye appealing about this restaurant. It is dirty, loud, smelly, and if you eat too slow, you feel like you're being urged to eat quicker by the waiters.

However, I keep coming back because their soup dumplings are the best I've ever had! I have tried multiple soup dumplings from nearby restaurants but none of them are on the level of Joe's soup dumplings. They're big, juicy, and flavorful! The soup inside is super warm and to die for.

Don't expect much from this restaurant other than their delicious soup dumplings. Chances are you will not get a table to yourself and will have to sit communal style with strangers. There is no such thing as customer service here. The waiters couldn't care less if you walked out because they were rude because other customers will take your spot right then and there. This place is always busy. I came in on a Saturday right when they opened and the restaurant was already packed.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Holy cow, this place is madness!

It's a relatively small spot and it seemed that literally all of Manhattan (myself included) required soup dumplings on a Saturday afternoon. Shoe up and get a number - you'll probably be seated with other groups if your party is less than 6. They also won't even talk to you unless your whole group is there and yes, they make you prove it. They turn tables like the place is on fire!

Inside is hot, chaotic and incredibly noisy. Settle in and order away - but know that things here are large so maybe order a little less. Of course, I didn't realize that and had way too much in front of me! Their soup dumplings were excellent - an order will definitely fill a person up because they're big, plump and filled with scalding broth. I had pork dumplings as well which were plenty good but definitely focus on the soup dumplings.

Reasonable prices, super fast service and a definite Chinatown experience.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"I came to New York knowing I wanted soup dumplings. My aunt did her research and found this place. AMAZING SOUP DUMPLINGS!

The place was very small and it is packed! They don't take reservations and seating is on a first come, first serve basis. After waiting for 30 minutes, we were finally seated.

Besides the packed restaurant and the long wait, this place was amazing. I heard they are expanding soon, so that will probably eliminate the waiting and space issue.

I will definitely be coming back!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"They moved the original Joe's Shanghai to a new location so I wanted to give it a try. During dinner time, the wait was long so I decided to order take out. (wait is like 1.5 to 2 hours, I don't recommend the wait unless hour are a tourist.) I called the restaurant and it took them 40 minutes to prepare my food for takeout.

I order the the pork and crab soup dumplings. I do not recommend ordering those for takeout bechasw they stuff them in a takeout box, the dumplings get stuff together and when you go to eat it, the soup falls out. It ruins the soup dumplings.

I also ordered the fried rice, beef rice cake and beef soup noodles. They were pretty good for takeout.

Overall, a good soup dumpling spot but not worth the wait because there are other soup dumping just as good around the corner. They need to have better soup dumpling takeout box to not ruin the soup dumplings takeout experience.

We had the scallion pancakes, the soup dumplings, and the beef flat noodles. The portions were very generous. It ended up being too much food for two people, so we took most of the noodles home. I liked the soup dumplings a lot; the ratio of soup to dumpling was pretty solid compared to other places that I've been to. Scallion pancakes were very standard. The noodles were a bit too oily for my taste.

Joe's Shanghai,"My Girlfriend and I came to NYC for comic con, and as huge foodies, we had to check out Joe's Shanghai after seeing all of its amazing reviews from other Yelpers. It's located in Chinatown, and you do have to explore the area a bit to find it. Stepping into Joe's Shanghai, the interior is very simple and it does not have the greatest ambiance. The utensils also did not seem that clean, and there were some cracks and chips on my plate, but I guess if you're going here, you came for the food.  There are only round tables that seat 8 people and due to their limited space, they will put strangers next to you if your table is not filled.

Fortunately, the servers are very efficient and super quick. We only ordered one item, which was the pork soup dumplings. They came out super hot and were a great value, you get 8 pieces for $8.00 (Cash Only). The soup dumplings tasted just like the authentic ones I had in China. The soup is very flavorful and the dumpling skin is light and delicate.

Overall, if you're in NYC, I would recommend coming to Joe's Shanghai for some authentic Chinese cuisine that doesn't break the bank, and to experience Chinatown.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's Shanghai is a place that is sure to please almost everyone, whether you prefer authentic Chinese or Chinese/American; Joe's Shanghai has a very extensive menu. I always order their Xiao Long Bao or ""soup dumplings,"" made with pork or pork and crab. They are loaded with meat and broth, and if you order takeout, make sure to eat them right away or the broth inside the dumplings will disappear and get absorbed quickly.

Another staple of this wonderful restaurant is their stir fried rice cakes. I usually get the seafood fried rice cakes, which are loaded with the scalloped rice cakes, scallion, mushroom, shrimp, scallops, onion, and whitefish. Another wonderful dish that they make is the seafood casserole, also made with scallops, shrimp, whitefish, crab, and various veggies such as lettuce, mushroom, lotus root and water chestnuts.

This is a place unlike no other in NYC, and kind of in the middle between authentic Shanghai and Chinese American. Just visit this place if you're in town!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Longstanding Chinese restaurant doling out favorites in a cafeteria-like atmosphere. Saturday afternoon, was able to get a seat at a large communal table without any wait.

Most of the main dishes are on the expensive side as they are family-style. Since I didn't have a family with me, I opted instead for the Spring Roll ($2.75) and the Pork Soup Dumplings ($8). While waiting, you are served green tea that's piping hot and good for the stomach. Spring roll is served with a side of soy sauce and stuffed with shrimp and pork. Found it to be overly greasy and not well balanced. The flavor of the shrimp was the saving grace. Soup dumplings come shortly after, several steamed pieces served with soy sauce and ginger. Again, flavor is a little dull - could have used some more spices for the added kick. Towards the last few the dumplings got much colder, so didn't finish the last two.

Servers come around often to make sure they get people in and out quickly. Not a fan of the automatic gratuity to go along with cash-only policies (especially since the main courses are more expensive).",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Welp, Joe's went and moved so might as well review the place now since I can compare the old and new spots all at once.

First of all, the new location (right on bowery) is bigger, nicer looking, but still somehow feels like the old place. Mostly because there is a line, and you still get a raffle ticket with a number on it that means nothing*. Here are some things that remain the same:

*Cash only
*Tax and tip are included in your bill (but leave a few anyway, as they only give themselves a 15% tip)
*That aforementioned line
*The quality of the food (we will get to this in a moment)

Some things that have changed:
*No liquor license yet, so don't expect a Tsingtao with your dumplings
*Tea does not come automatically when you sit down, but if you ask they will still bring it...in a soda class now (bring back the teapot guys)
*The bathrooms are nicer
*The place is brighter than the old one

All in all, this place still feels like the Joe's of old, just an updated version of it. The dumplings are still cheap and still good, as is the fried rice. The portions of rice are also still exceedingly generous for the price point and should be shared (unless this is all you're getting, but come on, you're here for soup dumplings and you know it). I hope it gets worn in a little soon though, as Joe's to me should have the feeling of a place that has been around forever - this place is an NYC staple and should feel as such. Yes, the location on Pell St will be missed, but they needed to expand; the fact that there is still a line to get in, even with all the extra seating highlights this. Thanks for keeping the food and the prices the same, I'll absolutely be back for a bamboo tray of soup dumplings soon (no, I'm not sharing, get your own).

Joe's Shanghai,"I'll start off by saying this location looks a lot fancier than the other location. I love the pork dumplings and all of its soupy glory. I would say they are Joe's Shanghai's best dish and the only thing I will ever get from here. It's nice and hot which makes it perfect for a cold day but it still tastes delicious when the weather is warmer, it's worth overheating for in the hot restaurant. I tried the cold noodles and it was way too peanut buttery; it literally tasted like noodles mixed with just peanut butter you get from jars. The service is definitely not attentive and is barely even there (which is probably why all checks automatically have 15% gratuity added). Everything with the exception of the soup dumplings was not my cup of tea.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

They have an ATM at the entrance if you need cash tho.

I really wanted to be critical, thinking this place might just be overrated and a tourist trap of some sort but right when I bit into that crab pork soup dumpling, I was in heaven.
They make their dumplings with love, and I fell in it.
The soup is so flavorful and is a little thicker than what I expected. Tasted more like chicken broth, quite oily as well. But sooo worth it!
The dumplings costs around $10.
They're not stingy with the crab either but be careful when eating this because there might be some shell still in the meat mixture. I crunched on a few. The dumplings of course come with the vinegar soy sauce and ginger as well as chili sauce which had a sour taste to me.

We also ordered the pan fried noodles. Light and airy noodles that pop in your mouth with that perfect crunch topped with the thick gravy sauce packed with napa cabbage, your choice of meat, and bean spouts.

That being said, the line isn't really worth the wait. We came around on a weekday 1.5 hr before closing so we didn't have a wait. We enjoyed our experience so we returned on a saturday late afternoon only to realize there was a huge line waiting. We ordered to-go and had a picnic at the park nearby.

The feel i got from the restaurant was authentic and you know they're working hard when they're eating from small plates from the kitchen at the front desk while helping customers at the same time.

The XLB is bomb as always, with the soup piping hot and delicious. The Peking Duck leaves a little to be desired, but for a restaurant serving Peking Duck in Manhattan at such a price, I wasn't expecting the same taste as I would expect in Beijing.

We stayed past their closing time, but they didn't rush us and didn't even give us dirty looks! In fact, they were very patient and nice, and we made sure to express our appreciation in our tip. 10/10 would recommend!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"It's funny, I can't even remember what movie I was watching yesterday, but one of the very first scenes, Joe's popped up on a driveby.  And mind you, the movie was filmed in the early 90's.  So, even back then, this place was prevalent.  Honestly, with how busy this place is, I am shocked there isn't more than 10-15K Yelp reviews.

With that being said, I went on a trip to NY a few months ago with my friends from the Bay.  I wanted to show them what was up with the food scene in NYC.  After gorging on all sorts of stuff, We managed to fit Joe's in on a Saturday night, before they closed.

This place sits in an alley, which, at first glance, it looks terrifying.  Don't worry, the locals just hang out on the street smoking weed (the young ones), and the older ones playing games and singing passing around a bottle of vodka.  With that being said, I didn't feel threatened.

While you wait (which, I would presume 90% of the time there is one), you get a raffle ticket- that is their queue system.  The place is small, so, your best bet is to hang out on the street and soak up the aromas of New Orleans-esque odors (aka sewage).  You may even catch a kitchen staff member or two just sitting outside chillin.  

They keep saying this place is cash only (they have an ATM, so do places down the street if you need one)- however, they may have upped their game.  Needless to say, the whole visit was confusing (and I was sober too), so, bring enough cash (or a loaded debit card) to be safe.  

There were 5 of us, and it looked like we shared a table.  I swear, if they could fit 8 at our table, they would.  With that being said, this place is very, intimate.  One of my buddies is even taller than me, and I was cramped- so I could only imagine how it felt for him.

I ordered the XLB via seafood and meat, along with the potstickers.  Also, had water and tea to drink (fyi, the tea seemed easier to get than the water...).  

Honestly, I wasn't too impressed with the seafood XLB, and it had an off yellow color, like bile- don't spill it on your clothes unless you want to look like a rabies bite victim.  Aside from the looks of the liquid, it just seemed underwhelming.  Mind you though, this place was bringing orders of XLBs out like Katz's slings pastrami sandwiches.  They must have a crew to just make those.

The potstickers were ok, I liked the texture, but the flavor was underwhelming as well.  Maybe that is the way it is supposed to be... But those were probably my favorite items I tried.

When we got our check, we got orange slices- the healthiest thing I ate all day.

I was glad I got to try it for the experience, I will def have to check out the one in Flushing now, but, I can't go with another group that big, I almost got stuck at the table.  Oh yea, and if you are a germophobe- steer clear of this place, just saying...",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Joe's Shanghai,"There is absolutely nothing that is eye appealing about this restaurant. It is dirty, loud, smelly, and if you eat too slow, you feel like you're being urged to eat quicker by the waiters.

However, I keep coming back because their soup dumplings are the best I've ever had! I have tried multiple soup dumplings from nearby restaurants but none of them are on the level of Joe's soup dumplings. They're big, juicy, and flavorful! The soup inside is super warm and to die for.

Don't expect much from this restaurant other than their delicious soup dumplings. Chances are you will not get a table to yourself and will have to sit communal style with strangers. There is no such thing as customer service here. The waiters couldn't care less if you walked out because they were rude because other customers will take your spot right then and there. This place is always busy. I came in on a Saturday right when they opened and the restaurant was already packed.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Holy cow, this place is madness!

It's a relatively small spot and it seemed that literally all of Manhattan (myself included) required soup dumplings on a Saturday afternoon. Shoe up and get a number - you'll probably be seated with other groups if your party is less than 6. They also won't even talk to you unless your whole group is there and yes, they make you prove it. They turn tables like the place is on fire!

Inside is hot, chaotic and incredibly noisy. Settle in and order away - but know that things here are large so maybe order a little less. Of course, I didn't realize that and had way too much in front of me! Their soup dumplings were excellent - an order will definitely fill a person up because they're big, plump and filled with scalding broth. I had pork dumplings as well which were plenty good but definitely focus on the soup dumplings.

Reasonable prices, super fast service and a definite Chinatown experience.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"I came to New York knowing I wanted soup dumplings. My aunt did her research and found this place. AMAZING SOUP DUMPLINGS!

The place was very small and it is packed! They don't take reservations and seating is on a first come, first serve basis. After waiting for 30 minutes, we were finally seated.

Besides the packed restaurant and the long wait, this place was amazing. I heard they are expanding soon, so that will probably eliminate the waiting and space issue.

I will definitely be coming back!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"They moved the original Joe's Shanghai to a new location so I wanted to give it a try. During dinner time, the wait was long so I decided to order take out. (wait is like 1.5 to 2 hours, I don't recommend the wait unless hour are a tourist.) I called the restaurant and it took them 40 minutes to prepare my food for takeout.

I order the the pork and crab soup dumplings. I do not recommend ordering those for takeout bechasw they stuff them in a takeout box, the dumplings get stuff together and when you go to eat it, the soup falls out. It ruins the soup dumplings.

I also ordered the fried rice, beef rice cake and beef soup noodles. They were pretty good for takeout.

Overall, a good soup dumpling spot but not worth the wait because there are other soup dumping just as good around the corner. They need to have better soup dumpling takeout box to not ruin the soup dumplings takeout experience. Please also bring cash, the still do not accept cash.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Ordered
soup dumpling (regular n the one with crab meat),
scarlion pancake,

highly recommended the deep fried duck, n the bamboo shoot with beef.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's is fairly popular, so be prepared for a wait. Went for dinner one evening and it was about a thirty minute wait. I just grabbed a number from them and came back after thirty minutes, and by then they were ready to seat us.

We had the scallion pancakes, the soup dumplings, and the beef flat noodles. The portions were very generous. It ended up being too much food for two people, so we took most of the noodles home. I liked the soup dumplings a lot; the ratio of soup to dumpling was pretty solid compared to other places that I've been to. Scallion pancakes were very standard. The noodles were a bit too oily for my taste.

Be warned that they are cash only, so make sure you bring some cash! We totally missed this until we paid. There is an ATM outside as well.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This new location has a nice interior but the food is overhyped. The crab meat soup dumplings are nothing to write home about (somewhat bland) and the shanghai stir fry noodles are too salty. I did like the scallion pancakes (good ratio of fluffiness to crispiness) and the red bean dessert pastry.

The food was overall pretty decent but for me, not worth an insanely long wait for some very average soup dumplings. That's what we came for!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"My Girlfriend and I came to NYC for comic con, and as huge foodies, we had to check out Joe's Shanghai after seeing all of its amazing reviews from other Yelpers. It's located in Chinatown, and you do have to explore the area a bit to find it. Stepping into Joe's Shanghai, the interior is very simple and it does not have the greatest ambiance. The utensils also did not seem that clean, and there were some cracks and chips on my plate, but I guess if you're going here, you came for the food.  There are only round tables that seat 8 people and due to their limited space, they will put strangers next to you if your table is not filled.

Fortunately, the servers are very efficient and super quick. We only ordered one item, which was the pork soup dumplings. They came out super hot and were a great value, you get 8 pieces for $8.00 (Cash Only). The soup dumplings tasted just like the authentic ones I had in China. The soup is very flavorful and the dumpling skin is light and delicate.

Overall, if you're in NYC, I would recommend coming to Joe's Shanghai for some authentic Chinese cuisine that doesn't break the bank, and to experience Chinatown.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"My tip is to come here just for the soup dumplings with pork during off-peak hours, like 3pm on a Tuesday.   Otherwise, it's not worth the wait.

You have to be okay with communal seating in round tables. Bring cash!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's Shanghai is a place that is sure to please almost everyone, whether you prefer authentic Chinese or Chinese/American; Joe's Shanghai has a very extensive menu. I always order their Xiao Long Bao or ""soup dumplings,"" made with pork or pork and crab. They are loaded with meat and broth, and if you order takeout, make sure to eat them right away or the broth inside the dumplings will disappear and get absorbed quickly.

Another staple of this wonderful restaurant is their stir fried rice cakes. I usually get the seafood fried rice cakes, which are loaded with the scalloped rice cakes, scallion, mushroom, shrimp, scallops, onion, and whitefish. Another wonderful dish that they make is the seafood casserole, also made with scallops, shrimp, whitefish, crab, and various veggies such as lettuce, mushroom, lotus root and water chestnuts.

This is a place unlike no other in NYC, and kind of in the middle between authentic Shanghai and Chinese American. Just visit this place if you're in town!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Longstanding Chinese restaurant doling out favorites in a cafeteria-like atmosphere. Saturday afternoon, was able to get a seat at a large communal table without any wait.

Most of the main dishes are on the expensive side as they are family-style. Since I didn't have a family with me, I opted instead for the Spring Roll ($2.75) and the Pork Soup Dumplings ($8). While waiting, you are served green tea that's piping hot and good for the stomach. Spring roll is served with a side of soy sauce and stuffed with shrimp and pork. Found it to be overly greasy and not well balanced. The flavor of the shrimp was the saving grace. Soup dumplings come shortly after, several steamed pieces served with soy sauce and ginger. Again, flavor is a little dull - could have used some more spices for the added kick. Towards the last few the dumplings got much colder, so didn't finish the last two.

Servers come around often to make sure they get people in and out quickly. Not a fan of the automatic gratuity to go along with cash-only policies (especially since the main courses are more expensive).",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Welp, Joe's went and moved so might as well review the place now since I can compare the old and new spots all at once.

First of all, the new location (right on bowery) is bigger, nicer looking, but still somehow feels like the old place. Mostly because there is a line, and you still get a raffle ticket with a number on it that means nothing*. Here are some things that remain the same:

*Cash only
*Tax and tip are included in your bill (but leave a few anyway, as they only give themselves a 15% tip)
*That aforementioned line
*The quality of the food (we will get to this in a moment)

Some things that have changed:
*No liquor license yet, so don't expect a Tsingtao with your dumplings
*Tea does not come automatically when you sit down, but if you ask they will still bring it...in a soda class now (bring back the teapot guys)
*The bathrooms are nicer
*The place is brighter than the old one

All in all, this place still feels like the Joe's of old, just an updated version of it. The dumplings are still cheap and still good, as is the fried rice. The portions of rice are also still exceedingly generous for the price point and should be shared (unless this is all you're getting, but come on, you're here for soup dumplings and you know it). I hope it gets worn in a little soon though, as Joe's to me should have the feeling of a place that has been around forever - this place is an NYC staple and should feel as such. Yes, the location on Pell St will be missed, but they needed to expand; the fact that there is still a line to get in, even with all the extra seating highlights this. Thanks for keeping the food and the prices the same, I'll absolutely be back for a bamboo tray of soup dumplings soon (no, I'm not sharing, get your own).

*If you're a party of two just stay in line, they will eventually need to fill a two top and if you're closest to the front of the line, you win.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"I'll start off by saying this location looks a lot fancier than the other location. I love the pork dumplings and all of its soupy glory. I would say they are Joe's Shanghai's best dish and the only thing I will ever get from here. It's nice and hot which makes it perfect for a cold day but it still tastes delicious when the weather is warmer, it's worth overheating for in the hot restaurant. I tried the cold noodles and it was way too peanut buttery; it literally tasted like noodles mixed with just peanut butter you get from jars. The service is definitely not attentive and is barely even there (which is probably why all checks automatically have 15% gratuity added). Everything with the exception of the soup dumplings was not my cup of tea.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"**CASH ONLY **
They have an ATM at the entrance if you need cash tho.

I really wanted to be critical, thinking this place might just be overrated and a tourist trap of some sort but right when I bit into that crab pork soup dumpling, I was in heaven.
They make their dumplings with love, and I fell in it.
The soup is so flavorful and is a little thicker than what I expected. Tasted more like chicken broth, quite oily as well. But sooo worth it!
The dumplings costs around $10.
They're not stingy with the crab either but be careful when eating this because there might be some shell still in the meat mixture. I crunched on a few. The dumplings of course come with the vinegar soy sauce and ginger as well as chili sauce which had a sour taste to me.

We also ordered the pan fried noodles. Light and airy noodles that pop in your mouth with that perfect crunch topped with the thick gravy sauce packed with napa cabbage, your choice of meat, and bean spouts.

That being said, the line isn't really worth the wait. We came around on a weekday 1.5 hr before closing so we didn't have a wait. We enjoyed our experience so we returned on a saturday late afternoon only to realize there was a huge line waiting. We ordered to-go and had a picnic at the park nearby.

The feel i got from the restaurant was authentic and you know they're working hard when they're eating from small plates from the kitchen at the front desk while helping customers at the same time.

This place isn't the best for cleanliness but the food we ate here was bomb! This location is hidden in an alley in Chinatown.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Came here with my team, and although it's not very enticing to serve a group of teenagers who don't look very rich or like very good tippers, they did just that! Service was fast and polite, and all our dishes came within reasonable times.

The XLB is bomb as always, with the soup piping hot and delicious. The Peking Duck leaves a little to be desired, but for a restaurant serving Peking Duck in Manhattan at such a price, I wasn't expecting the same taste as I would expect in Beijing.

We stayed past their closing time, but they didn't rush us and didn't even give us dirty looks! In fact, they were very patient and nice, and we made sure to express our appreciation in our tip. 10/10 would recommend!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"It's funny, I can't even remember what movie I was watching yesterday, but one of the very first scenes, Joe's popped up on a driveby.  And mind you, the movie was filmed in the early 90's.  So, even back then, this place was prevalent.  Honestly, with how busy this place is, I am shocked there isn't more than 10-15K Yelp reviews.

With that being said, I went on a trip to NY a few months ago with my friends from the Bay.  I wanted to show them what was up with the food scene in NYC.  After gorging on all sorts of stuff, We managed to fit Joe's in on a Saturday night, before they closed.

This place sits in an alley, which, at first glance, it looks terrifying.  Don't worry, the locals just hang out on the street smoking weed (the young ones), and the older ones playing games and singing passing around a bottle of vodka.  With that being said, I didn't feel threatened.

While you wait (which, I would presume 90% of the time there is one), you get a raffle ticket- that is their queue system.  The place is small, so, your best bet is to hang out on the street and soak up the aromas of New Orleans-esque odors (aka sewage).  You may even catch a kitchen staff member or two just sitting outside chillin.  

They keep saying this place is cash only (they have an ATM, so do places down the street if you need one)- however, they may have upped their game.  Needless to say, the whole visit was confusing (and I was sober too), so, bring enough cash (or a loaded debit card) to be safe.  

There were 5 of us, and it looked like we shared a table.  I swear, if they could fit 8 at our table, they would.  With that being said, this place is very, intimate.  One of my buddies is even taller than me, and I was cramped- so I could only imagine how it felt for him.

I ordered the XLB via seafood and meat, along with the potstickers.  Also, had water and tea to drink (fyi, the tea seemed easier to get than the water...).  

Honestly, I wasn't too impressed with the seafood XLB, and it had an off yellow color, like bile- don't spill it on your clothes unless you want to look like a rabies bite victim.  Aside from the looks of the liquid, it just seemed underwhelming.  Mind you though, this place was bringing orders of XLBs out like Katz's slings pastrami sandwiches.  They must have a crew to just make those.

The potstickers were ok, I liked the texture, but the flavor was underwhelming as well.  Maybe that is the way it is supposed to be... But those were probably my favorite items I tried.

When we got our check, we got orange slices- the healthiest thing I ate all day.

I was glad I got to try it for the experience, I will def have to check out the one in Flushing now, but, I can't go with another group that big, I almost got stuck at the table.  Oh yea, and if you are a germophobe- steer clear of this place, just saying...",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"We went around 8:45pm and were told a 30+ minute wait, which is a bit too much for New York restaurants, especially since there is no Yelp waitlist. When you are seated, you essentially share a large table with multiple parties, which can be fun or awkward depending on the group dynamics and your personality. It was ok for us.

The food failed to meet the expectations of the wait. We got the sesame noodles and the pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao). The sesame noodles were prepared poorly because of the flavor and the starchiness texture that accentuates the poor flavor. The xiao long bao was okay, as I have tried much better before. You carefully pick up the dumpling and place it in a spoon in case the soup leaks out. This was necessary because these dumplings are relatively large compared to the standard. The soup is pretty good but the pork inside needs improvement as it is not that flavorful. Overall, this place seems to be overhyped and definitely not worth the wait.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Already a regular of Joe's Shanghai although I've only been here a month, I'm always after the scallion pancakes and soup dumplings!

Though the skin on the soup dumplings could be a bit thinner for the true soup dumpling texture and taste that I so enjoy, Joe's Shanghai has its own spin on it - there's so much soup packed into each one, and a generous amount of filling/meat in each one too! And at its price in a place like New York (8 soup dumplings for ~$8-9), it really can't get better than this. The scallion pancakes are another favorite dish of mine, partially because of the delicious sweet sauce that they use with it too! They're also really affordable, at around $5 for a stacked plate. Joe's Shanghai has a very modest storefront and only accepts cash, but there's always a line out the door waiting to be seated during peak lunch and dinner hours. I've already taken my friends and my boyfriend here to visit, and they've all loved it.

Great service and quality of food - I'd definitely come back again!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Excited to try this place especially because of the good reviews. This place was packed on late Monday afternoon. Waited about 10-15 minutes. Community style seating. You can be sat with strangers at a round table if you have a small party OR lucky enough to get private seating. People are friendly and keep to themselves. Saw others making friends and even sharing lol. The restaurant itself was pretty small, saw a large queue start to form after we finished eating. Over heard a party of 4-5 be quotes for a 40 minute wait. came for the xao long bao, left on the disappointed.  Being a fan of din tai fung I had very had high expectations. XLB wrappers were very thick and broke easily. On the better note, good taste and the actual XLB was on the larger size. On the cheaper side so wasn't too disappointed. Tried the pan fried noodles and scallion pancake and those made the visit worth it.

PRO TIP: CASH ONLY, ATM outside. I get paranoid about random ATMS so I ran down the block to Bank of America and withdrew money from there.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Good Shanghainese food BUT don't come here for the Xiaolongbao. For a place known for Xiaolongbao, theirs really disappointed me because it was so bland and overly chewy. However, the other dishes were great. The scallion pancake was my favorite because it's super crispy and flavorful, but be forewarned that it tastes nothing like the ones you can buy at the supermarket.

Make sure to come right when the restaurant opens to avoid waiting for a really long time. It's a bit on the pricier end but it's probably worth it. Overall, I would probably come here again but will try other things on the menu.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Really liked their crab meat xlb and scallion pancake. It lives up to the hype!

However, the only slightly negative comment I have about this place is that upon entering, I was hit with this huge smell of ""stinky socks"", if you could describe it like that. It was extremely unpleasant (especially by the doorway) but you get used to it once you're inside (sadly). Food is good, but just this is maybe something that could be improved.

Due to the number of people waiting to come here, you may be asked to sit at communal tables with another party.

It's also cash only!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Congratulations to Joe's Shanghai on their new location! This place has been a favorite of mine for about 15 years at their old location on Pell St. While the old location, just around the corner, did have a certain dingy charm, the new location is much more spacious, brighter, and cleaner, and there are more bathrooms. Although you'll probably still need to wait for a table before dinner, you can expect a shorter wait time as there are many more tables at this location.
Still, the food is as good as ever! My go-to order is lots of pork soup dumplings (the absolute must if you eat here), scallion pancakes, and pan fried chicken noodles. Everything I've ordered from them is excellent, although you can never go wrong with just lots and lots of soup dumplings.
Expect to share a table if you don't have a large group. Staff are fast and accommodating.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This is how I picture what home tastes like if I lived in a traditional Chinese household. The soup dumplings are stellar. Pork better than crab, IMO. It's a bit too crabby for my taste. I also really enjoyed the fried rice.

Joe's Shanghai,"My quest for the best xiao long bao has brought me a long way from my home in Hawaii...... all the way to Manhattan's Chinatown. I was here on vacation (I used to live here and consider it my home) and browsed Yelp, of course, to look for a place to eat soup dumplings. A few reviews stated that Joe's Shanghai was very good, although touristy. Hmmm.... I was staying in the Village so Chinatown was close by. Why not? My best friend from my early NYC days and I hopped in a cab and off we went.

I'm happy to say that when we went today, it was not filled with tourists. In fact, it was filled with a lot of locals, which is always a good thing. We were promptly seated and brought glasses of hot tea, which were so good on this cold February morning. We ordered turnip cakes, scallion pancakes, pork pan fried dumplings, and pork xiao long bao. Where do I begin to describe how delicious the food was? The turnip cakes were crunchy on the outside, soft and almost creamy in the middle, and a very good start to our wonderful meal. Our server quickly brought out the scallion pancake and pork dumplings. Scallion pancake is a must have - nicely crispy with a deliciously mild scallion flavor. The black vinegar complemented this perfectly. Pork pan fried dumplings were also a hit, with a crunchy exterior and deliciously moist interior, with lots of pork flavor. Our last dish brought out was the pork xiao long bao. This beats any of the XLBs I've had in Hawaii. Very juicy, with hot, flavorful soup that you slurp up after you poke a small hole in the side of it, then add chili oil or black vinegar and enjoy the heavenly pork filling. What an outstanding dining experience! I hope to come back on my next trip to NYC, which will be in a few months. Other tables were having fried rice, noodles, chicken and beef dishes, but there were only two of us and we didn't have the stomach space, so sadly the amount of food we could eat was limited. I give this place a well deserved, solid 5 stars.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Oh Wow! This place was awesome, usually not a big fan of Chinatown NYC but this place is worth coming back! Highly recommend the Soup Dumplings! Service was quick and portion was  great - taste at the right priced!

Joe's Shanghai,"My boyfriend took me here to end our night on new years eve. He had already been here but wanted to take me because he raved about how good the soup dumplings were! We had been to a different place w/ xiao long bao before here in Boston but he said they weren't as good as Joe's Shanghai!

We got two orders of crab + pork soup dumplings and one order of pork soup dumplings. They come with eight each, so we each got 12 dumplings. They were just delicious! So flavorful and also very filling (which is a good thing). I almost died when I finished all 12 dumplings because I was so full.

And, just like my bf said, these WERE better than the place in Boston! I loved it here!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Hand's down the best xiao long baos I've ever had! The XLBs are huge, definitely not like those dainty ones from Din Tai Fung. The soup inside is flavorful and piping hot -- be careful and try not to burn yourself! The scallion pancake is also highly recommended.

This was one of the cheaper meals we had in NYC, probably because it's located in the chinatown area. Beware, this casual restaurant gets super crowded. Sharing a table with strangers is a normal thing here, so get comfy! Or you can wait hours/ years (exaggerating) for your own table to open up. The servers really try to get you in and out -- don't feel offended, that's just how things roll here! Plus it adds to the fast and efficient service.

SOLID 5/5. Can't wait to come back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's Shanghai is known for its xiao long bao (soup dumplings), just like Gourmet Dumpling House in Boston or Din Tai Fung on the west coast. I'm always on the hunt for some good xiao long bao, so I was steamed and ready to give it a try and bao down to the buns Joe's has to offer.

When in New York City, it's expected that you'll be spending lots of money on food, so it was refreshing to find such a highly esteemed place with one dollar sign. I was here with one other person, and we shared a very substantial meal that we couldn't finish and for fair price. We ordered the crab meat with pork meat soup dumplings, pork meat soup dumplings (classic xiao long bao), and the Shanghai sautéed flat noodles. The total ended up being around $38 for both of us after tax and tip. Overall, this is a pretty solid bang for your buck, especially in the Big Apple. Joe's also includes a 15% tip when they give you the check at the end. This place unfortunately only accepts cash though.

Another important thing to note about Joe's is that it always tends to be busy. I wouldn't expect any less from such a famous place as this. To cut down on wait times, you'll likely be sharing a table with other parties. This isn't particularly ideal for an intimate setting, but you could still make it work if that's what you're shooting for.

Though Joe's Shanghai certainly has its shortcomings, I'd gladly return to try more of its menu.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"The new place is not so great. Bad experience. Horrible. If it ain't broke don't fix it. I'm beyond upset.

The line is not as fast or organized. Seating is slow but I was prepared  for that.

Then we saw beer on the menu but when we went to order our usual Tsingtao they said they had no license for beer sales so I was stuck drinking Diet Coke which I don't care for. Water sucked with the dumplings. Not the same. What happened to the license? Maybe tell people!

It took forever and a day to be seated but I didn't mind until we were basically told to hurry up and order almost immediately after being seated. So rude!

Do not rush me. Ever. I took a subway from Times Square then walked seven blocks to get here. Wtf.
Now let me mention this all was on Christmas Day. This was my Christmas meal! I'm am so upset to be treated this way. Unacceptable.

I had to ask for water twice. Got weird looks from staff. Whatever.

Had to ask for the customary ginger for the dumplings. It was exhausting. They brought the food out in stages. Bring it all out at once please. My complaints go on and on.

The food is good but the new place sucks. Just sayin. Not sure I'll be returning.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"After hearing all the hype about Joe's Shanghai, I decided to give it a try when I was in the area during lunch. We got there at 11:30 and there was not a single table that wasn't occupied. Immediately I thought, the hype must be real and I was even more excited.

Ordered the pork soup dumplings and they were delicious. I really wanted to try the pork and crab soup dumplings but my friend doesn't eat crab so I settled for the pork. It was good and just the right amount of juice inside the dumpling. The fried pan noodles were also good- tasty, noodles were great, right amount of pork. One of the orders came out incorrectly and they had no problem switching it and correcting the mistake.

I would definitely return but because it is so busy at night, I would opt for going during lunch.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

I wholesomely love those dumplings with every cell of my body.  I want to be the soup dumplings.  I must become them again.  

I waited forty minutes to be seated as a single diner to a communal round table deep in the back of the restaurant.  I was crammed in with all the other non Chinese people.  
I didn't care about any of that.  None of it bothered me, the service was whatever.  Those dumplings were all I wanted and needed in that time and I didn't know it till I had them. Juicy, popping delicious explosiveness happened inside me.  

I ordered more food but those soup dumplings were all I need.  Those dumplings are all I need.  I want your dumplings Joe!  I need them.  Ah!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's was part of a recent food crawl I took part in through Chinatown,  popped in for a couple of orders of soup dumplings on a Thursday afternoon, and to our surprise found an empty restaurant.

I'm jumping on the soup dumpling band wagon with the least surprising review you're going to read about eating here.....  

The dumplings are perfectly prepared, twenty twists a piece in traditional fashion. The ratio of soup to pork was spot on and each bite was better than the last.

My only issue with their product is the dumpling sauce, this is purely personal.....  I'd love a bit of vinegar in there for some tang, but that's hardly a blight on a near perfect dumpling experience.

As good a soup dumpling you'll find, that said I can't speak for anything else on the menu.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Truly amazing! Joe's is located on a small street in Chinatown. We arrived a little after 5 PM and there was already a 25 minute wait. That's when you know the place is good!

Joe's looks like your typical Chinatown restaurant. There isn't anything special about the interior, but the emphasis is placed on the quality of their food. Note: they only take cash!

[ Pork Soup Dumplings ] Our group of four ordered four sets of soup dumplings. Each set is served in a dim sum box and comes with 8 soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were bigger than I expected and they spill over the soup spoon. The skin of thick but easy to break apart and the flavor of the soup is deliciously rich. My friend taught me her technique! First, you bite a hole into the soup dumpling and drain the soup into the spoon. Then you dip the rest of the dumpling into the provided vinegar and chase it all down with the soup.

[ Scallion Pancakes ] Very crispy and oily! These served as great ""sponges"" to soak up any soup that spilled from the soup dumplings.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"I have to admit, I came into their newly renovated restaurant without an open mind as had a negative connection with their old place today for lunch. Was very pleasantly surprised with their soup dumplings ( we ordered the crab and pork soup dumpling) as the skin thickness was actually not too thick which was perfect for me. There was a decent amount of soup in each dumpling as l well and the size was pretty generous.

The atmosphere was nice as well as it did not feel too crowded as I am claustrophobic myself so meets my space requirements

We ordered 4 dishes ( including the soup dumplings) and total damage was in the $50s  with tax and tip, which is normal when dining in Manhattan. It will slightly cheaper if you dine in flushing.  

Finally the bathroom was clean as well ( cannot say this about all restaurant in Chinatown)

Attached a few pics as well so take your time to have a look

Overall, Definitely a good place to bring your friends to for lunch as food is decent and atmosphere is nice. May come back for a second visit. Also would recommend you    Visit early if you're looking to do lunch. The lines here stack up and the wait can be long if you come at the wrong time.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Get the soup dumplings and get lots of them!  My share of our dinner summed to 6 soup dumplings and I probably could have eaten more.  The other dishes are a bit hit or miss.  I'd even say there is no shame in only getting soup dumplings!!!

Scallion Pancakes: Tasted freshly made in-house.  Some places seem to get the pre-made stuff.  Crispy all around.  The sweet soy sauce dip and hot sauce (on the side) helped cut the richness.

Pork Meat Soup Dumplings: Probably the best I've had and I've had a lot!  There is just so much soup in these babies.  You can tell when you suck them dry and there is tons of floppy skin left.  I appreciate that the top dough is a bit thick, allowing for extraction from the bamboo steamer without leakage. Though I do prefer using chopsticks rather than the metal tongs, since the pointy edges can also puncture it.

Pan Fried Crispy Noodle w/ Beef: The few bites of crispy noodles along side soggy noodles were great.  Ample amount of tender beef, tons of veggies and a thick sauce. However, I wasn't a fan of the presentation.  It came out with gravy spread all around, leaving very few crispy edges.  I like when places pour it on at your table and focus on creating only a tiny pile in the middle.

Crispy Pork Chop with Pepper Salt: Kinda disappointing.  The pork chop bits were really tough.  Also, random bone and gristle made for unpleasant surprises when eating, since it's hard to see beneath the deep fried coating.  Worth passing by next time.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"BEST. SOUP. DUMPLINGS. EVER!!!

Came to Chinatown after a couple drinks for some delicious drunken dumplings and boy were we pleased!

First off, they have a HUGE MENU. There's ateast 70 items on there!

Yummies:
Kung Pao Chicken (spicy,crispy, flavorful)
Pork Dumplings (flavorful,tricky to eat if beginner but worth it= trick is to poke at it, let the soup run out, then eat the dumpling!!)

Meh:
Crab Dumplings

Yuckies:
Scallion Pancake (plain jane)

Def took a while to learn how to eat the soup dumplings but my life was definitely changed and my palate evolved. Cant wait to go back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The noods: chewy and good.

Rice cake dish: chewy and good.

xlb: super good. big. cheap. valuetown.

Crab xlb: good.  big.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"The soup dumplings here are on point. The broth is nice and rich with pork fat. The pork inside the dumplings are decent and the dumpling skin is to chewy. Service is okay. You can't have high expectations for a Chinese restaurant that has high volume of traffic. Definitely, worth a try",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"I was in the area for a doctor's appointment and met my mom for lunch here. I haven't eaten in a Joe's Shanghai since my freshman year of college! This new location is much bigger and less crowded than their old location. All orders are taken on iPads and the menus are brand new. Staff are much nicer here as well. I'm not sure if they got new staff or trained the old staff, but everyone was much nicer and more accommodating.

Food is good - but more expensive than some other places in the area, so I'm not sure I would make it my go-to spot for soup dumplings. But I will take visitors here, that's for sure. The new location is very nice.

We split their soup dumplings and I had an order of their fried dumplings. Their soup dumplings come 8 to an order, which is 2 more than I'm used to. They do note this on their menu, but I wasn't really paying attention. I just wanted food! Soup dumplings were very good and soupy! Perfect for a cold winter day.

Knocking a point off because my mom's noodles came so much later than our other food and I was basically done eating by that point.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"For second dinner we decided on Joe's Shanghai! They are known for their soup dumplings and we couldn't wait to try them :) We ordered some beers, tea and crab/pork soup dumplings. We also got some scallion pancakes as well.
The soup dumplings were good but weren't the best I've had. The broth tasted great and you get plenty of crab but the meat itself I feel wasn't seasoned as well. The scallion pancakes were okay too. Overall the meal was just okay. Worth the try though!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Review is only for the not so xiao, xiao long baos! Really though these are some of the hugest xlb dumplings I've ever had and coming from California I've been to tons of Chinese restaurants in my lifetime.

The pork ones are pretty good but the pork/crab ones are soooooo juicy and delicious. Highly recommend springing for the crab ones because they're wayyy more flavorful and they actually do put a good amount of crab. They add some yummy steamed shredded cabbage which is nice because most places don't give anything with their baos.

I liked the crab pork dumplings so much I came back two more times in my one week in NY. Nothing else on the menu really impressed me in addition to the fact the prices for everything else seemed too high.

Still will keep coming back and doing my takeout bao orders when I'm in NY.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Was so excited to try out the famous Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown. They open until 11pm on Sundays and I arrived around 9pm due to a last minute urge for adventure before the work week started again. The wait was long, even though I was one person. They have a strict policy in that your full party must be present before seating as well and keep in mind this is a cash only establishment! Despite those nuances, I really enjoyed my meal. I started with the pork soup dumplings, which were really good and had a rich, thick and slightly salty broth. I had trouble eating them as they were large but thank goodness I didn't get it on my white shirt. Next I got the shredded pork with dried bean curd and jalapeño. The dish was not spicy at all and was not great. I think it could have benefitted from some more sauce but I also don't like my food on the dry side - personal preference. They end off everybody's meal by brining orange slices before the check. I was stuffed and happy with my meal, and all I wanted was a cold beer to be on my way. Unfortunately, they re-opened this new location recently and do not have a liquor license as yet so until then, keep in mind your favorite soft drink preference. Joe's lived up to the hype, I kind of wish I had chosen a different entree. Next time, I'll get the Shanghai noodles.

3 stars for long wait, no liquor license, cash only  establishment, and me entree was not great.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Truly the end of an era. This new location is GORGEOUS and brand spanking new. The decor is simple and not overwhelming however I will forever reminisce about their old location filled with photos of famous visitors to the location as well as the fear of being run over by cars navigating down the one way street as we wait for our number to be called. The food here is luckily the same quality as their old location however the speed of the dishes were so slow. We came during an off lunch hour and the restuarant was not at all busy. However each dish took a significant amount of time to arrive at our table.

DIshes we love here: crab and pork dumplings, shanghai thick noodles, string beans, shrimp with meat sauce. You can not go wrong with ANY of these.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Only came here to try the xiao long bao and it was certainly quite the experience! The gf and I came before the lunch rush and was able to get seated at a shared table (two gentlemen sat across from us). We were not too hungry and only wanted to share an entree and decided to go with the XLB as it is highly rated on yelp. We also received complimentary tea and about 10 minutes after ordering received our freshly steamed XLB. The skin is not as thin as Din Tai Fung but it certainly helped hold all the dumpling juice inside. There was so much soup that the XLB would droop down from the weight! The meat was tasty enough as well and for about $10 I definitely felt it was worth the price.

Overall, the service was quick and I was fortunate that the staff didn't give me a hard time for only sharing one entree or requiring a minimum per person. Highly recommend visiting this restaurant and would definitely consider ordering more if I had a larger group!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"TOURIST TRAP!!! If you like going to Bubba Gump Shrimp and other tourist traps like that, this place is definitely for you. There's no locals there at all. I'm so pissed I even wasted two hours of my life eating here. The dumplings were not even good, if you have been to DTF, you know what I mean. The bathroom was a nightmare, beyond disgusting.
The dumplings and every single dish we ordered had about a half a gallon of oil in it.
This Joe guy is probably counting his cash and laughing at all you stupid Americans.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"When I tell you...THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT...and I hate waiting. During our visit to New York, I heard so many great things about Joe's Shanghai. I didn't think to believe the hype, but there was a crowd waiting outside. We waited nearly an hour for our table.

When we were finally called, we had to share a table with two other people which wasn't preferred to me but it's New York, and the place was packed. However, we were served pretty quick.

Now the dumplings. I've never had a soup dumpling before..and I'll never find another dumpling as good. I'm not being dramatic, I came back home to find soup dumplings but nothing compared. I dream of them (again not being dramatic.) The dumplings come fresh, they are nice and large and have the most flavorful broth. I ordered the pork and crab meat...yes.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"We passed by the restaurant many times and finally got a chance to try it.
We ordered the xiaolong bao, the scallion pancake, the lion head, the peppy fried pork chop, the pan fried noodles.
The must-try are the bao and pancake. The bao is very juicy and good deal. The pancake is crispy and delicious    
The pork chop is too dry. The noodle is too salty. To us, they are not as good as the ones in other restaurant.
The lion head is disappointed  the first one is overcooked and it is all black. I have no  idea why the chef and waitress didn't notice.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Obviously, THE place to get soup dumplings in Manhattan, so be prepared to wait.

But that's okay.

Come early, grab a number, and take a walk around the neighborhood. Check back in and be seated.

Order the famous xiaolongbao, which are delightful little dumplings, filled with broth. Crab beats plain pork soup dumplings, but honestly, both are delicious. An eight-dumpling serving is filling, especially if you order another appetizer. Scallion panckaes are a safe bet. Warm, flaky, stretchy? I'm down.

Inexpensive eats. Free tea and orange wedges to round out the meal.

Cash only, don't forget. You don't want to be scrambling for cash when the check drops.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's Shanghai is a lot of fun.  It feels very ""authentic"" (whatever that word means these days).  I am Chinese and have had a lot of dumplings and xiao long boa in my life (including in Shanghai), so I can't say that the dumplings and XLB were the best I've ever had.  However, they were definitely yummy, and I would go back (and wait in line).  The service is quick (though not friendly, but what can you expect from a Chinese restaurant).  

One thing that was off-putting was the smell when you walk in - the sour smell was confusing.  It was either the smell of feet on a hot summer day OR the smell of the red vinegar you put on the dumplings.  I chose to think it was the dumpling vinegar.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Still my favorite dumpling restaurant! The soup dumplings are huge! They barely fit in my spoon! The meat and the soup have so much good flavor it's hard to compare to other establishments! I've been here once before but man I'm so happy I was able to try this again! It was so good, we almost came again! I believe they have several locations but this one in Chinatown has to be the best.

It's true, if you have a small party, they will seat you at a family style table in order to move guests in and out as fast as possible. It's not too bad if you just want to enjoy your food and go. I noticed there were many solo guests who didn't mind the round table company.

The service was great! We were in and out of there within 45 minutes it seems.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"A longtime favorite! Come here for the soup dumplings, the scallion pancakes, and all the Shanghainese delicacies -- sautéed flat noodles, soya duck, and the like.

The crab XLB are the best -- especially when paired with the vinegar served. Everything else is up there as well, I like ordering a side of mixed greens to balance out all the sodium from the other dishes. Prices are a bit higher for Chinatown but well worth it. Bring cash -- cash only!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Joe's Shanghai,"Ver authentic food with excellent service! The dumplings are a must, perfectly steamed bursting with flavor with the first bite, we also had the pork fried rice and chicken and egg noodle dish, can't remember the exact name. The fried rice was some of the best I've had but the egg noodle dish was just ok, good but kind of bland. The food here is fairly priced and portions are definitely shareable. Will definitely be back on our next visit to New York.

Joe's Shanghai,"This place is cash only, make sure to stop by an ATM first. Joe's Shanghai is known for its soup dumplings, and it is worth the wait in line. I have been coming here for years, and their quality is consistent. Soup dumplings are exactly what they sound like, dumplings filled with soup. They offer pork soup dumplings and another option, which is crab and pork. Both are amazing and a few tips for eating them for new comers:
1) Pick up the dumpling with care and put it on your soup spoon.
2) Do not just bite into the dumpling; the soup will squirt everywhere!
3) Poke a hole into the dumpling and empty the soup onto your soup spoon, drink it after.
4) Eat the dumpling as normal.

Do not be afraid to put hot pepper on and some sauce on your dumpling, adjust to your taste. The overall flavor is savory with a little bit of sour. Love it. I usually get a scallion pancake to soak up any leftover soup. If I'm with a group, I also tend to get the beef with string beans. The string beans here are always much crispier than those I have from other Chinese restaurants. Do not be afraid to ask for water; you will get tea when you sit down.

Gratuity is added on the bill, do not worry about tipping unless you want to.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This place is overrated to me. They're famous for their soup dumplings, but honestly, their soup dumplings is only alright to me. Nothing that really blows me out of the water compared to other ones that I've had. The price pretty good though. They're cash only and gratuity is included in the check. The service is really bad though but that's typical for the OG Asian restaurants.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"I've been hearing people talk this place up for awhile now so I was glad to finally swing by!

Party of two on Saturday at 11am, no wait, they'll seat you at a large table them fill it with other patrons as they stroll in.

We ordered their crab and pork xlb and their pork xlb. Crab and pork was the better of the two, mainly cuz the meat had a nicer, juicier texture to it.

Otherwise these are huge in size, they're overflowing your soup spoon! Tons of soup in every one too!

Make sure to bring cash as they dont take card, and make sure to come hungry.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Honestly think this place is a tourist trap. Sure their XLBs look plump, but the meat seems very mushy and the sauce is very thick and oily. Luckily, there was no wait when I got there on a weekday for lunch, but I wouldn't waste my time waiting to try their XLBs. My stomach felt funny afterwards - probably from the oil.

Granted I haven't tried any of their other dishes, but XLBs here are overhyped.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's Shanghai is the place to go in Chinatown. It's cheap, it's delicious, and they have a menu that's expansive enough that everybody in your party will be happy. I've been here many times, and my go-to is the soup dumplings.

The most important thing to know is that you should be prepared for a pretty long wait if you're here for dinner time. For a table for two, and it was not even the most crowded I've seen it, I had about a 25 minute wait. When we were able to be seated, we shared a table with 4 other people... Which was kind of tight, but I can't fault the place for being popular.

On the walls around the restaurant, there are photos of every celebrity you can think of with the owner. It's dim, it's cozy, its surprisingly quiet for a place that is standing room only.

The food came out surprisingly quickly for a place that was this packed- and the food was good. I only come here every so often because of the weight, but I've never regretted the wait.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Came here in search of soup dumplings and we were not let down! By far the best soup dumplings I have ever had! I already know I will have to come back here each time I am in NYC now! An absolute must! We ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings, which were delicious to say the least. It was hard to choose since everything sounded so good. We also enjoyed the shrimp fried rice and the fried spring rolls, which also had shrimp.
This place is cash only and will seat you family style if your party is small. I came with just one friend and we were seated at a 6 person table with other people. We came around 4pm on a Thursday and it was about half full. I can already tell this place gets packed when it's closer to the regular meal times.

Good portions for the price. The food was very good. Authentic. They had a mix of American style and Cantonese style as well. Lots of options and the wait wasn't very long.

I want to say that their soup dumplings are the reason why they are coming but I looked at some peoples table and there's no soup dumplings. Do remember if you're coming here it's cash only.

I came for the soup dumplings. I'd only order soup dumplings here and maybe every now and then chive pancakes.

They serve two types of soup dumpling. The classic pork soup dumpling and a crab soup dumpling. I like the crab soup dumpling a lot more than the pork. The crab soup dumplings has the classic pork with some crab and fatty part of the crab. I totally recommend this place for that.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

For a dumpling specialist they do not have many dumping choices at all. Maybe 3 options. The soup inside the dumpling was very tasty. The dumplings were too big and wide in my opinion. They didn't fit on the spoon and would explode before my mouth. Not the best dumplings at all.

The waiters are downright rude and chase customers for larger tips. Treatment of tourists is shameful.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"The restaurant is a very busy one, with a size being small as well. So keep in mind that you'll be waiting. They have small tables and also large tables. We had a party of 8 so it was quite a while. They seat people as soon as a party leaves but it varies by size, not by the order you placed your name. We waited for a little over an hour and got seated at a large table but it was community style. The other half of the table was with strangers but I personally liked it because food brings all types of people together. *truth* you obv don't have to talk to them if you don't want to.

What's great about eating at an Asian restaurant is that there is a dish for everyone. So, I am pescatarian, so I eat seafood but not any traditional meats like red and chicken. So I ordered a shrimp noodles dish. There was broccoli and other vegetables but the noodles come hard. And you have to mix the shrimp and veggies together with the sauce to make the noodles not as hard. But it was honestly one of the better dishes, even the meat eaters agreed. I didn't get to try other Chinese restaurants in the area because we didn't have a whole lot of time in New York, but I would def recommend this spot!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"I've already written about the wonders of Joe's shanghai previously. I stand by what I said before - come here for the pork xiao long baos. I'm not sure I would order the other things. My co-worker got an order of their sesame chicken which was deep fried and then covered with a sugary syrup sauce. It tasted good -- hard to mess up fried foods with sugar though :P

Be careful of the long wait. Even on a weekday at 3pm, we had to wait 30 minutes. X_X",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's Shanghai is fantastic. The soup dumplings are heaven sent. The dumpling itself isn't heavy and it's perfectly filled to give you an incredible bite ratio of dumpling to filling. Get both types of soup dumplings. I personally love the crab and pork ones the best but the pork ones are also delish! When I come here, I just order these with scallion pancakes and I'm happy.

I think most complaints of this restaurant are probably due to the wait BUT the wait is worth it! I went on a Sunday afternoon, party of 3 and we waited 20 minutes, which is short. We were once immediately seated on Monday evening around 7:15pm for 2. Patience is indeed a virtue.

If it's your first time, it is a bit overwhelming because when you're seated you're typically with strangers and everything and everyone is so busy shuffling about. But hang in there. Get your head in the game and order the right thing for you, not the thing everyone else has. (The right thing is the dumplings) the staff are not the friendliest people either. BRING CASH but they do have an ATM. yes, they have a bathroom.

I've also had their general tso chicken, crispy noodles, fried fish, rice. All of it is great but dumplings win my heart. You will not be disappointed by the food.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This place is definitely a hole in the wall type joint. The Shanghai dumplings here are so good and cheap! In my opinion they are better than Din Thai Fungs which are a lot smaller and more expensive. Highly recommended if you're in the area (Chinatown) and are craving Shanghai dumplings. I got all of the Shanghai dumplings and they're all good. I love their soy sauce because its has some sort of vinegar already in it which gives the dumplings extra added flavor!

Tip: Cash Only!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This was our first stop on our trip. It was pretty darn cold outside, but we didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes outside, phew! We decided to only try out their XLBs (being the foodies that we are, we wanted to squeeze in as many places as we could in the short time we were here). We tried their crab/pork & pork xlbs (8 pieces each). The crab & pork xlbs, which were a bit more expensive, were delish - would highly recommend trying these! The xlbs were filled with soup and very juicy! I'd love for them to open a location in SF!!

There is another Joe's Shanghai location, but they are not affiliated with them whatsoever. The restaurant even had a sign clearly stating that because people could be easily mistaken, lol!

Cash only! They don't seat you unless your whole party is present.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,one of the few things i miss most about NYC. I dream of these dumplings more than one person should.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Tucked away in a small, unassuming street of NYC in Chinatown is one of the most famous places for a classic Chinese dish called xiaolongbao (dumplings filled with meat and soup). We were a group of 4 visiting the day of thanksgiving but the place was already packed requiring us to wait 15 minutes. There is nothing glamorous about this restaurant. It's somewhat unclean, the interior is super cramped, the lighting is poor, the furniture is old. Yet, you have to come here for the food rather than a fine dining experience. We got both the pork and the crab and pork xiaolongbao as well as the Szechuan style pork and the shrimp and pork with dry bean curd (see pictures). I personally liked the crab meat xiaolongbao the most but the other dishes were very authentic as well. The staff is not the friendliest but their service is good and fast. Be ready to pay about 20 dollars a person minimum if you want to be stuffed with good food!

Overall:
Food: 10/10
Service: 9/10
Environment: 5/10
Price: 7/10

Would I visit again? YES",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Joe Shanghai order

So def. start with:

1 order of pork soup dumplings
1 hot/sour soup
1 scallion pancake
-
1 crispy shredded beef
1 sesame chicken

Bonus: Shanghai noodles, a fried rice dish, but I always get the free white rice bowl (just ask)

Also - when you get in, ask for John.  He's the GM.  Very nice guy.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"A soup dumpling experience you can't miss while in New York.

Food:
We decided to start off with a classic, the Shanghai Spring Rolls, they were crispy on the outside and warm and delicious on the inside. I could of ordered a second order because of how good they were but I wanted to save room for everything else. We then got the famous soup dumplings and boy was it an experience! There's no other word to describe it because of how good it was. Be careful because they're not but they tasted great and left my taste buds satisfied. Finally, we ordered the young chow fried rice, personally a great side to get because of all the things in it, from chicken, pork, shrimp, ham, and eggs. This goes great on the side of some sesame chicken or other meat dish.

Price:
Crab Meat with Pork Steamed Soup Buns (6): $10.75
Young Chow Fried Rice: $15.50
Shanghai Spring Rolls (2): $4.25

Vibe:
I love the energy at Joe's Shanghai because of how inclusive it feels. A majority of the tables in the restaurant are large so you're sharing the table with other parties. Seeing other people, what they're ordering, how they're eating makes the experiences so unique and interesting. I even tried something new people another group also sitting at our table suggested something. The wait usually is pretty quick, about 15-20 minutes depending on how busy it is. People are usually coming in and out pretty quick tho. This spot is also CASH ONLY so make sure to keep that in mind.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's Shanghai is well known in Chinatown amongst both tourists and locals. Although I wouldn't say it is the best place to get soup dumplings or other Shanghainese dishes, it is a sort of right of passage in New York Chinese cuisine.

Expect a wait, especially on weekends and for large parties as Joes does not take reservations. There's always a wait outside spilling into the street(we had a 30-45 wait for a party of 2 on a Saturday evening) and inside the restaurant is bustling and filled to capacity. Unless you are with a large group, you will likely be seated at a table with other diners. Although some might find the restaurant's tight space and shared tables uncomfortable, I enjoyed the energy, seeing what others were ordering, and chatting with other diners.

If you're a tourist visiting Joe's, pay attention!! For the best experience, order items for your party to share. Guests are served tea with their meal so drinks are not required. Joe's is especially well known for their Xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and I would say it's a must. Both the pork and crab soup dumplings are good, but I love the crab soup dumplings. DO NOT waste your visit by ordering the typical American Chinese dishes you're used to ordering at your local Chinese takeout spot (General tso's, Kung pao chicken,Sesame Chicken etc. Two other parties at my table did this and I was crying inside). Some tasty dishes that I recommend if you're new to Chinese food are Szechuan Beef Tendon Noodle Soup,  Shanghai Fried Rice, and Sautéed String Beans. From my experience the spice in dishes is toned down, even dishes marked as spicy are not too spicy. For those that want a bit more heat, there is also table chili oil (also pretty mild lol) to kick it up a bit. The meal is finished with complimentary orange slices, yum!

TL;DR expect a wait, order the soup dumplings, skip the American Chinese stuff you're used to, try something new.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"If you come to NYC you MUST come check this place out. There's usually a wait to be seated if you come for dinner on a weekend. We came on a Thursday to try to avoid that and we ended up not having to wait at all for a party of 8.

This place is all about the food. You must try their soup dumplings. This is what they're best known for. Be cautious, they will burn your tongue!

We ordered the sesame chicken which is one of my favorites here and the fried rice. The plates are large (maybe one plate for two people to share) If you have a lot of people make sure to order multiple plates so you can try several things!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,Good soup dumplings. The new location is spacious and clean. Always here for soup dumplings. Will recommend here if your around the neighborhood.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Love love love the soup dumplings there. And the price is good.

Their service is fast once you get the table (normally has a long waiting, they do not take reservation).

Need to sit with strangers on the round tables, if you wanna get private table, the wait will be even longer.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"They treat their customers like crap.  The waiters are over-worked, cranky and often unresponsive to even a modest request.l (I had to ask 3 times before I could get a glass of water. ) When my food came, it was plopped down on the communal table three feet away from me.

The mandatory tip on ALL checks is smack in the face.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This is a very popular spot in Chinatown and it definitely lives up to its reputation! The food is so good. I got pork soup dumplings, lo mein, Kung pao chicken, and scallion pancakes. Everything was delicious! It's traditional Chinese seating, so you may have to sit with people who you don't know at the same table. One downside is the bathroom's cleanliness, sanitary standards should never be compromised.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"CASH ONLY.

Absolutely love XLBs and heard this was THE spot to check them out (from Chicago so there surprisingly aren't many good places for XLB).

Came here on a Sunday afternoon and no surprise, there was a line. We had a party of 5 and didn't have to wait too long, maybe 20-30mins? Estimated was 45-60 so we were quite happy!
Please note your entire party must be present to be seated.

*We were all seated in a big round table with other parties. Looks like they do communal seating to maximize tables. We didn't feel too squished luckily but perhaps not everyone's cup of tea.*

Ordered the two crab and pork XLB and two regular pork one (each order came with 8 baos). Both were absolutely amazing! Perfectly thin skin with a delicious broth inside. They also give you a dish of soy sauce/vinegar/ginger mix. The party next to use ordered fried rice only and we couldn't believe it, but to each their own!

Would definitely come here again the next time in NYC - for more XLB and probably try some of their other dishes!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Went on Chinese New Years. This place was bonkers! There was a line that went around the store on the outside. So many people wanted to come in. And so many were in line just to get on the waiting list despite the chilling and dreary rain drizzling out. It was unlikely my family and I were going to get tables that day so we just ordered to go. Got the soup dumplings of course. On the record, I preferred the pork over the seafood one. Nevertheless, they were both very delightful. I could see what the hype was about. I wish they had more dumpling options (e.g., prawn). Would have been cool if there was a second floor. The cashier and the person who took our order was kind and thoughtful in taking our order and giving us recommendations.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Best food ever! REAL AUTHENTIC. Dumplings, fried rice, beef and broccoli we got. Incredible taste. Portions are for a group not for one, unless you're a heavy eater, standard prices. Can't wait to go back.

**UPDATE: new location is incredible. So much better, private tables, open, clean, beautiful!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Line was really long and it was super crowded inside but we went on a Saturday afternoon and waited for an hour for 2 people. The dumplings were pretty good but I don't know if the skin was too sticky or the steamer wasn't big enough, the skin kept breaking and the soup kept leaking out. The soup was delicious though, super rich in pork flavor and the meat wasn't too salty at all. Skin wasn't too thick which I like a lot. Tempted to try other things but only if the line isn't too long.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Disclaimer!!!!!! You will sit at a table with strangers!!! You are lucky if you get a table with just your party. We were not aware of this and skipped all the reviews that said this. Worth the hype? I mean they were good but not worth the wait, poor service and sitting with strangers. Our table was full of lovely people but I felt like I was intruding in their space. The waiters kept reaching over and in between while we were eating. They also charge you an automatic a 15% tip for them giving you the menu and not refilling your water. Tip: Don't come hungry, came Saturday evening around 545, didn't sit till 7. Everyone came rolling in after that, it was crowded. Go inside to get a number, there is no line, claim your spot.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"One of the best in Chinatown!!!
You need to wait to be seated but it's worth the wait. Their famous dumplings with soup are just the best you can eat.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This place is on everyone's go to soup dumplings list. I had the pleasure of coming here when visiting friends one time, and did not know anything about how popular this place was. They do not take reservations, so I waited for about 35-40 minutes outside, in the cold. When it was finally our turn to be seated, I was almost ready to call it quits, if it wasn't for the investment of time I had already sunk in. I went with a group of friends, about 10 of us in total. We ordered several orders of the pork soup dumplings, and 2 orders of the crab soup dumplings, along with some lo mein, fried rice, several other dishes. The experience was good, but I the crab soup dumplings were the most memorable. They were memorble because they were not good, compared to the rest of the dishes. I remember taking a bite, and thought to myself if I really had to finish the rest of it. The flavor was off, it did not taste like I was eating crab, but more of like something foul. The regular soup dumplings, were pretty good, but absolutely forgettable. If this is your favorite or only place you know to get soup dumplings then by all means keep going, it's not bad. However, if you want to know if there are other restaurants that serve also serve delicious soup dumplings, the answer is yes! Go do some research, you will definitely find better soup dumplings.

Overall:
I later find out that it was not as popular with locals as it was with tourists. Apparently when tourists google soup dumplings, this place pops up from all the good reviews from other tourists, and being a competent restaurant, they were able to maintain a good image and good reviews from out of town-ers, which gives it its high score of 4 stars. However, it's not the same with locals here. There are other restaurants here that serve the same quality soup dumplings, and some maybe even better based on personal preference. The long lines from tourists are usually a turn off for most locals, and they prefer to go to less popular establishment but still serve delicious soup dumplings.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"4 star for their soup dumplings- they were pretty fat and juicy! However the best part about a soup dumpling is the soup... They actually had the audacity to serve one that was clearly popped and dry. I was so annoyed because I had to suck it up and eat that one :'( other than that, the pork soup dumplings were delicious. Crab soup dumplings were alright- I still recommend you try one of these just so you can decide for yourself if you like it!

Other food- DONT DO IT... Unless you're not Asian or you're into like Americanized Chinese food. If you are bringing your Asian friends and family here, seriously don't bother with the food outside of soup dumplings. That last picture was apparently twice cooked pork... But for anyone who actually has eaten twice cooked pork, this is nothing like it!
The green beans were okay but they were supposed to come with more meat in it...
The beef dish was mostly veggies and like a small amount of beef... It should've been in the veggies section of the menu!
Everything tasted unauthentic which is really unfortunate because I expected better from an Asian restaurant in Chinatown.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Went today for Joe's shanghai grand reopening. New place is clean and decor is beautiful. When you walk in you will notice the Beautiful carpentry work and lights/lanterns. The new atmosphere is extremely comfortable, it's new joe shanghai atmosphere is perfect. It can cater to if you want to go out on a date, a night out with friends, or a family gathering. Atmosphere and decor is perfect.

Most importantly, the food is amazing! I have yet to find a place that can beat their soup dumplings. (I am a local New Yorker and I've traveled all over the world including shanghai) the dumplings itself always burst with incredible flavors and will leave you craving for more. The scallion pancakes and shanghai fried flat noodles are also the best ever. They also have signature dishes such as pork shoulder, traditional cold dishes, and fish head casserole which are excellent and truly authentic.

Staff and service is always quick and efficient.

Joe's shanghai has been in business since 1994. This place has alot of hype, but best believe the hype is real. If you are a tourist visiting NYC this is a must go to spot, and for all the regular locals, check out the new joe's shanghai in Bowery!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Honestly, this was my favorite part of visiting New York. The soup dumplings were the best thing I had. I can't even describe it. You just have to try it. There usually is a wait. We waited 30 minutes before being seated. The food came out fast. Note that it is cash only. I'm planning to come back here next time I visit.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"We came specially for the crabmeat soup dumplings. They were delicious. Sharing the round table with someone else is a bit different for us but maybe this is norm here since the restaurant is small.

Warning, cash only.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Came here around 1:30 on a random Tuesday for 2 people and still had to wait around 30 mins. There was also a group of 14 that got seated before us, but I wouldnt recommend coming here with a large party during weekends or evenings since seating is very limited. We had to share a table with two other parties of two but its ok, the round table is big enough.

As you can see, I was really bad at taking pictures because I kept eating and forgot to take the pictures when the food came. The fried bean curd came first and was delicious. It is a cold appetizer and it was very flavorful. The scallion pancake wasnt out of the ordinary. The soup dumplings is probably the reason why this place is always packed. My girlfriend taught me to pour the soup out of the dumplings first and I have to say, pretty good idea! The soup fills the spoon perfectly and lets you enjoy the soup by itself. Once the dumplings cool, you can put the whole dumpling soup all in your mouth but be careful! I had an accident where the soup squirted out so do that at your own risk =)",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This place was found by my special lady. She had a list of places to go to and we had Joe's Shanghai on the list. We went in early and had no wait. We decided to order small as we were on the go getting quick bites.

So we ordered the Dumplings and the Shanghai noodles.

We were totally impressed.

I never had dumplings before so first one the soup went on the plate a bit. After that I was a professional dumpling eater lol.

So good I tell you I can eat those all day long.

Next the noodles which was very good as well. And we love thick noodles as noodles give you long life.

We noticed someone did not finished egg rolls next to us and I was highly disappointed you never leave egg rolls behind.

Anyways loved the place will come again

Chow 4 now",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"There are lots of reviews on this place - trust them. The pork soup dumplings are worth the wait.

Just some tips:
- This is a CASH ONLY business. There's an ATM outside if you need to get some more cash for those extra dumplings you will order.
- They add a 15% gratuity to the bill so no need to tip.
- You will be seated at communal tables if that's the only spot open. It's not too bad and you will be seated with your group.
- Expect at least a 30 minute to 1 hour wait for bigger groups - maybe a bit less for 2-3 people.

Food: My friends and I ordered two baskets of pork soup dumplings, General Tso's chicken and lo mein. The pork soup dumplings are hooooooot, so make sure to make a hole inside of the dumpling to let the steam out and then dip in the soy sauce + ginger combo. General Tso's chicken is delicious because the sauce - the sauce is just so..so decadent and perfect. The lo mein had a perfect texture and was not oily whatsoever.

This place is a must for visitors!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,Very busy but not a long wait. Family style seating if your a couple of two. Dumplings and stuff ordered by a friend. I will report soon. Some kind of pancake.. lol it's GOOD.

Joe's Shanghai,"The new Joe's Shanghai is MUCH better. The wait is just as long, but it is significantly cleaner. The staff are also very attentive, which is just amazing.

Soup dumpings - 5/5 - hands down
Rice cakes - 5/5 - best in Chinatown
Singaporean rice noodles - 3/5 - a bit dry
Fried pork ribs - 4/5 - tons of batter, not enough meat

Will return here for soup dumplings.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Joe's Shanghai,"Honestly, I was pretty disappointed with the food. I came with high expectations after seeing this place being recommended by many articles. Maybe as a Toronto native, I've been spoiled with amazing Chinese food for decent prices, but this place is definitely mediocre at best. Especially given the 45-minute wait. I would not recommend coming here.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Shanghai noodles were a hit they're thick and good with chicken.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Pros: Really really good xiao long bao, as expected. When you go during non-busy hours, it's amazing since service is pretty quick and you can take your time (and maybe order more XLB!)

Cons: During the really busy times, it can be tough to get seated and service may be a bit lacking, but that's to be expected from one of the busiest restaurants in the area!

I've always had a good experience here so if you have time, it is worth the wait!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This place is wayyy overhyped and definitely a ""tourist trap"".

First of all, let me start by saying- I don't mind waiting in line for awhile for good food.... but! This place has a totally messed up system. The tables here are communal, so I understand that sometimes a 3 person spot may open and jump ahead of the two, but they completely skipped our group and then when we asked they basically just said ""oops.""

Second. I know this place is busy, but the customer service is subpar. They rush you through your order and seem frustrated if you ask questions.

They are known for their dumplings - they only have two kinds. They're just okay. We tried both (pork and a pork+crab) and I honestly couldn't tell you which was which. We also had the scallion pancake which was oily and lacked flavor unless you put a lot of sauce on it.

Dumplings came out quick. There's the one positive.

There are sooooo many other places to get good food in Chinatown that I wouldn't waste your time on this one.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"I am so glad I came to Joe's Shanghai! I had seen several recommendations on both yelp and YouTube. The food did not disappoint! It was very busy when I went alone at about 2:30 but I was seated immediately at a community table. There were several couples at the table and I had a great conversation with a man traveling from Germany.

I read a recommendation for the pork meat soup dumplings so that is what I ordered. They were FANTASTIC!

I was wishing I wasn't alone so I could share multiple dishes.  Several of the other couples at my table ordered noodles which looked and smelled amazing! I am definitely going to bring my husband back here for dinner to try the lo mein and sesame chicken!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's Shanghai was the first place I went to during my trip to New York. We were already at the front of the restuarant 10 minutes before they opened so there were generally no customers.

The service was subpar, as the workers only took our orders and were never to be seen again.. I came with a group of friends and we all came to Joe's for their famous soup dumplings. We ordered both crab and pork soup dumplings and to be frank, were slightly disappointed.

The soup dumplings were just overloaded with soup and barely any meat inside. I've had my fair share of soup dumplings at many different restaurants, but there was no balance between the meat and the soup so I got tired of the taste very quickly. We ordered 5 orders of soup dumplings total, but unfortunately ended up leaving 1 order untouched.

It was a good experience as this restaurant is supposedly famous for their soup dumplings, but I will not be coming back again.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

China town in Honolulu has wayyy better soup dumplings!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"The food was incredible here! While service isn't the friendliest, they definitely have a system in place to get you seated, fed and out the door quickly to accommodate as many customers as they can in their small dining area. We didn't have one set server the whole time but somehow the orders came out perfectly each time. I liked how they asked me as soon as we were seated if we wanted to order any soup dumplings since they are well known for that and it takes a little while to prepare. We ordered both types of soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, Shanghai style noodles and crispy noodles. Everything was amazing! I wasn't a huge fan of the crispy noodles but others in our group liked it. They deep fried noodles to make it crispy and then ladle a thick sauce all over it with lots of veggies and shrimp. Would definitely go back for the dumplings!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"I have to say I am very dissapointed in this restaurant, it opened not too long ago at the new location on Bowery and the wait was usually 40 minutes(tourist trap) today we walked by and it was no wait so we decided to give it a shot I been to the old joes over five years ago and was not a fan, gave it a second chance.. the appetizer arrived first and we were all excited and starving their soup dumplings is plump that's where they get one star.. that is one of the better soup dumplings in Chinatown it's comparable to shanghai cafe and 21 shanghai, shanghai cafe is better IMO. Their kao fu, sweet tofu with mushroom was also a hit... it's a cold appetizer dish. Everything else that came after was lacking in everything it was either way too sour for the sweet and sour fish, too salty and bland for the chicken, too breaded and salty for the pork chops and the pig feet even though drenched in sauce managed to be dry and salty and the only thing my coworkers thought was decent was the string beans cause it wasn't terrible(it was just bland).. if you do come I recommend sticking with the appetizers and their soup dumplings.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"I went to this place due to the good reviews on Yelp.  It did not disappoint.  We tried both the pork soup dumplings and the crab pork soup dumplings, spicy Szechuan sliced beef special and the scallion pancake.  Helpful tips, CASH ONLY, 15% tip already included on check and may get a communal table and sit with other people.

Review:
Beer:  They have limited beer and very limited wine selection.  We had Tsing Tao beer.

Food:  The soup dumplings were very good.  It was our first time having them and enjoyed them.  I just did not find them as exciting as some of the Yelp reviews.  We liked the pork soup better than the crab/pork soup but both were very good.   We would get them again but may not make the journey just for to get them.  We also had the spicy szechuan sliced beef.  It was indeed spicy.  I like a lot of heat and they were at the top of my tolerance level.  I loved it.  It came floating in bean sprouts and sauce that  made the rice fantastic.  Speaking of the rice.  They gave us one small cup to share but it had a nice aroma and subtle flavor.  It might be jasmine rice.  Not sure but it was not just sticky lumpy white rice.  Finally, the scallion pancake.  Loved it.  we almost didn't order it as the sound of it was not exciting.  It was delicious and worth getting.  Get one.

Overall, Joe's delivered what it promised.  Thanks fellow Yelpers for the very helpful reviews and recommendations.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Just came back from a group lunch here. Joe's is an institution and no tour of Chinatown can be complete without it. The food itself is quite good- cheap, satisfying and filling.

The good-
Pork soup dumpling- signature item, pretty straightforward but yum! Make sure you have it with a bit of the chilli oil they have at the table. Also pro-tip to not let soup all over ypurself- take the dumpling in the spoon first, puncture it with the chopstick, slurp some of the soupy goodness that oozes out into the spoon, and then only take a bite.

Sichuan sliced beef- loads of mala flavor, nicely balanced by the crunch of bean sprouts.

The meh-
Crab soup dumpling- the quality of the crab isn't great, so this one's meh. Not bad at all though!

Cold chicken and cucumber- weird dish. The chicken tasted like potatoes. Couldn't make any sense of this dish.

The ugly-
THE WAIT TIME. If you come in the weekend, be prepared to grab a bubble tea next door and wait and wait. We waited 45 mins.

Also it's crazy busy, and you have to ask for even water and rice. Not really blaming them because it's very good value for money, but just a heads up.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Overhyped and not consistent. I've only been here once so maybe we were unlucky, but the state of our xiao long baos were unnacceptable.

Food: My friend and I only got the pork xiao long bao and scallion pancakes to share-- the pancakes were great, but our dumplings were so soggy and floppy that they came ripped and stuck to each other/to the basket, causing all the soup to spill out.  The flavor of the soup wasn't that great either in my opinion. We showed the waiter and he offered us new dumplings (but 2 dumplings because we had 2 left), which was nice, but I couldn't believe the dumplings came out like that

Service: There's usually a wait to get in, it wasn't too bad for us (15-20 min) on a Sunday afternoon. Service is prompt; our waiter couldn't really understand my questions, but that's fine.

Atmosphere: It was definitely packed in there and tables were places very close to each other.

Basically, overhyped. I've had better xiao long baos/shanghainese food elsewhere that didn't have a wait.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Was the first time out in Canal street and got a little hungry after doing all that underground shopping lol. Came on a Monday evening around 9PM and waited max 15mins. for a table for 2. The moment we sat down, they didn't ask us if we wanted anything to drink, they straight asked us if we wanted to order the pork soup dumpling... LOL thats when I knew I had to order those bad boys.

The pork soup dumplings are a MUST when you're here. If you don't order those, you might as well go elsewhere. Ordered the dumplings, chicken fried rice, shanghai beef noodle, scallion pancake and kung pao chicken. The other foods were average tho like 7/10. When I come back I definieylu will be ordering the dumplings and scallion pancakes again.

And you want to know what was even better than the quick service, friendly staff and tasty food? For all the food we ordered above, we only paid $57. And that was including tax and tip!!!! We left with so much food leftover and I'm so excited for leftovers. If you're ever in the area, come to Joe's Shanghai!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This place is famous for their soup dumplings, but I would say they are pretty average. I don't really eat soup dumplings but the few times I've tried out some other restaurants, Joe's Shanghai wasn't amazing. Its good. Not amazing though. However, they are priced well and it is pretty cheap to eat here.
I also recommend getting a scallion pancake. You will not regret it. It is really good. Enough said.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"YESSSS!! this place is all it's cracked up to be! Our hotel bartender recommended it and wow! I would stick to the dumplings which are out of this world and the best soup dumplings I've tried; the fried dumplings are also delicious and the standard dishes such as fried rice and chicken dishes.

BRING CASH!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"It was all hype for us.
Place was very crowded, outdated and the bathrooms were disgusting. The food was just okay, honestly the reviews on this place set my expectations a little too high which is probably why I was so disappointed.
Cash only",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"If you're coming to Joe's Shanghai, prepare to wait at least an hour before you get seated. I went with a group of five during the evening, and although the wait was long, the food was definitely worth the wait.

The pork xiao long bao is a must-try! The pork dumping was more flavorful than the shrimp. Each batch has eight pieces, all decently large. The fried calamari is the best I've ever had; lightly fried but very flavorful and has a slight kick from the peppers. The beef and broccoli is honestly very flavorful and pairs perfectly with rice. The ja jiang mien was okay; I wouldn't get it again. The sauce was much sweeter and had a strong peanut flavor; it tasted like spring roll peanut sauce.

Overall, the food is delicious and comes out of the kitchen pretty fast. I would definitely come back and try more dishes. Highly recommend.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Your in China Town....Joe takes you to Shanghai, China...it's busy, but not crazy yet. The two of us are three back from being called to the ""Diners Table"". But, they call ""six"" of us up and suddenly your transported to China...you sit at a large round table sitting all parties. A printed letter of the English (you think) alphabet is placed in front of each group. No one converses with any ""outsiders"". It's as if you are sitting at a private table, but it's not private. The menu looks like it's written in a different language. The English writing seems foreign to you. You choose two cups of sake, a Szechuan Beef and a Shrimp Lo-Mein. The beef is tender medium rare perfectly cooked. The beef is in a Szechuan sauce most delicious (Gen.Tso married to Miss Hoisin..:). Our Sake was delivered in small odd looking bottles. But this Sake very good!!!..:) The Shrimp Lo Mein was tasty; The shrimps though smaller than desired, were accompanied by crispy delicious bean sprouts. Waiters come at you like Ninja Warriors, seeming to drop in and out of sight from the ceiling..:) We had plenty of leftovers to take back to our Temporary Villa. Oranges brighten the end of this fun meal. As you leave somewhere near 7pm, you see the crowd of people (many Asian) waiting with great humility (humility is not thinking less of yourself; it is thinking of yourself less.""..:) to be called to the Round Table. Thanks for reading.

Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's is definitely one of my favorite places to get xiao long bao. The soup dumplings have a rich broth and aren't too heavy. Other must try's are the scallion pancake and fried pork dumplings. Both are good compliments to soup dumplings and have a nice consistency (very doughy)!

This place is definitely a tourist trap which makes waiting times very long (usually 30/45 mins+) so I definitely recommend getting there early. They really try to get everyone in and out as fast as possible, so there's very little accommodation to your party which makes the service kinda iffy. But it's whatever, the food makes it totally worth.

Overall; Joe's is definitely a must-stop for soup dumpling enthusiasts!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This is my first review of Joe's Shanghai's but I have been several times now. I have been to the one in Manhattan and the one in Chinatown most recently which this review is based on. The one in Chinatown was a little hard to find at first because it recently moved to a different location and my uber ride took me to the older location. Luckily, it was still walking distance to the new location so it wasn't a big deal but just something to keep in mind. The new location is 46 Bowery St which is a bigger and much nicer space than before.
Every time I go to Joe's I always order the same thing which is the soup dumplings with pork and the scallion pancakes. Both are very delicious (especially the soup dumplings) and are something I crave every time I am in NYC! The soup dumplings are not available where I live (SC) and so this makes them even more enticing every time I come to NYC.  I would say they are the best soup dumplings in the city but that would not be fair because I have heard there are many other places in NYC that have great soup dumplings as well but I never want to take the chance of being disappointed since I usually have very limited time when I am in the city. Having said that, you cannot go wrong here by coming here for the soup dumplings and this is always a must do spot in the city if that is what you are craving. The only caveat with going here or to any of the locations is that you are looking at a 45-60 minute wait which is annoying but I feel like it is still worth the wait. I am giving Joe's 4 stars only because I have ONLY eaten the scallion pancakes and soup dumplings and they have a pretty extensive menu available. I do not feel like it is fair to judge an entire restaurant based on 2 items off the menu even though they are so delicious. I will say though that I have seen other food items come out of the kitchen and they all looked really good.

Pro Tip: If you go to the new location in Chinatown then go next door to the hotel called Hotel 50 Bowery NYC. They have a great bar and rooftop that is a perfect place to get a drink and enjoy a nice view while you wait. It's a little pricey but worth it.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Stopped in here on a Saturday night. Wait wasn't too bad for 3 people, about an hour. Seating is family style, just like in China.

We ordered:
- Singapore Mei Fun
- Crabmeat and Pork Soup Dumplings
- Pork Soup Dumplings
- Twice cooked pork

Everything was awesome, especially the dumplings. They tasted just like the ones we had in Shanghai. The overall price and service were great. Wait was well worth it, will be back!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This may seem like a hole in the wall nestled in China Town but it is THE BEST Chinese food I've ever had. The wait is worth it, the seating allows you an opportunity to meet new people (you may sit at a table with other parties), and the service is quick. I order the sesame chicken, note the broccli comes out cold, they're know for their dumplings and fyi your soda comes in a can. A note was handed out advising the china town location will be moving December 1st so next time I visit I'll be anxious to see the new location.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"When I saw that Joe's Shanghai moved to Bowery Street, I knew I had to try this place out. I went there with my family and we really enjoyed the food there. We had gone there to try their soup dumplings and we didn't regret it. Although the food was on the pricey side, the environment was very clean and well put together. When I walked inside, the place was very spacious, it didn't seem cramped at all compared to their old location in Chinatown. The service was great, even though we had to wait a while for seats.  Other than the waiting time, everything else was a great experience. I would for sure recommend more people to come here and try their dishes!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Please get the soup dumplings! Never would I have thought shrimp and pork would mix, but boy oh boy was I missing out! Make sure to poke a whole and let the steam out before biting into them, or you'll be in for a hot surprise ;-)

Also tried their fish and dry noodles (forgot to snap a pic) and they were both delicious! If you're in the area make sure to stop by!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,Love this place so much. You may have to wait over an hour for a table but it's worth it. Best soup dumplings in the city! The entrees are all excellent. It's one of my go-to places to take people from out of town.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,The dumplings. Do yourself a service and get one of these. The watery juice inside alone was so surprising and warm. I loved this dish. We got lots of food. Great sit down and communal dinner. They forgot an order we made. The room is really decorative and bright. Nice clean bathrooms.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,Everything is so salty and they don't even taste good.  There are so many other place that are way better everywhere else.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"While planning for our trip to NYC, one of the things we kept hearing about were the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai. And since it was freezing cold out, we knew we had to give them a try when we ventured into Chinatown.

We went around 1PM on a Thursday and we were sat right away. They started off by bringing us some hot tea, which was much appreciated since it was so cold outside. As for food, we started with the soup dumplings and then also ordered the scallion pancakes. There are 8 soup dumplings in one order, so it was the perfect amount to share for 2 people. They came out super fresh and steaming. And they were the perfect way to warm us up. The scallion pancake was also really good. They were perfectly golden and had a great crunch on the outside. We could have ordered another small dish to share if we wanted, but decided to explore and eat around more of Chinatown. But if you are looking to only eat here, then I suggest adding another dish to what you order.

One thing to keep in mind is that they are cash only! So make sure you are prepared. The prices are really reasonable and totally worth it. I would definitely be willing to come back to try more of the menu and of course to get their coveted soup dumplings again.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"The soup dumplings are worth the hype. I came to chinatown for 5 days and ate there 3 times simply to get the pork soup dumplings and scallion pancakes. The service is fast but not very friendly, and the entrees are quite average. However, 4 stars just for those amazing dumplings.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"For sure an adventure, not the best Chinese food I have ever had but very interesting. First off cash only so make sure you know that. Second it a scrum to get into this place so for sure plan to get there 30 minutes or more before you plan to eat and don't be surprised as you get seated for 10 strangers at a big family style table.  We were at a table for 10 with just the two of us. We had the soup dumplings of course and they were for sure the highlight. If I would were to go back I would have gotten two orders of those and perhaps just one dish more (for two people).  They are worthwhile as others point out, be very careful when eating as the soup is inside.

We had a sesame chicken dish that was very good and a broc beef that wasn't amazing but servicable.  This is an experience and due to buddy who lives in the city I found it.

As point out cash only and the put the 15% tip for you, frankly the service sucks so they probably were getting less so added in.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Ordered takeout from this place instead of standing in the line. However, I can see why this place has a line. The food here is spectacular. Definitely plan on eating here again.

Ordered the spring rolls, general tso chicken, dumplings, and shrimp fried rice. It did not disappoint as well! Everything was cooked to perfection and super flavorful without tasting salty or nasty.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's Shanghai was a decent Shanghai restaurant. It's definitely a place for people who are new to Shanghai cuisine, since there are much better places in Chinatown for xialongbao's and Shanghai cuisine.
The price was a little expensive for this type of restaurant, but the food was good at least. Highly recommend their Crab meat xiaolongbao (soup dumplings). We ordered the regular xiaolongbao, crab meat version, and braised pork shoulder.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"As we drove back to New Jersey in the Lincoln Tunnel, my wife asked me ""So, are you going to give Joe's Shanghai five stars?""

When she asked me this, we were blissfully full, having experienced wonderfully prepared soup dumplings and other delectable dishes. I was preparing to have dreams about this stuff. If these ratings were only about the food, Joe's would get 11 stars from me. But, alas... Eating out is about the entire experience.

I cannot say what hasn't been said here. The food at Joe's is phenomenal. Soup dumplings are the signature dish, and they definitely get there for the Yen. So does everything else, particularly the scallion pancakes, which were strikingly comfortable like the Jewish version ... and addictive like warm crispy tortilla chips and cilantro-laden cool Mexican salsa. The noodles were al dente and succulent like anything you might imagine from 'The Sopranos' or 'Goodfellas,' but in a spicy Asian sort of way. The only weak area involved the hot & sour soup. If anything, it was a boring half-hearted effort.

Service on our visit was quite attentive, and accurate considering we shared a communal table with three other parties.  And though the 30-minute wait could have been trimmed to 15 minutes with a little organization on the part of the hostess, I quickly forgot about the 30-degree outside temps when we were ushered indoors -- one step closer to dumpling nirvana.

But it's neither the half-ass hot & sour nor the disorganized hosting that irks me. Believe it or not, it's the whole cash-only thing. And the automatic 15 percent gratuity.  Sure, I brought cash. But I have to wonder why such a busy place won't get with the 21st century and accept plastic. (I could guess why, but I digress.) The automatic gratuity pretty much defeats the whole meaning of gratuity. In fact, it becomes a fee when it is part of the bill. But, I was going to give 20 percent, so Joe's Shanghai lost a few bucks on us in that department.

Hey, my principles aside, this place is marvelous. Fun. Delicious. I'll be back with plenty of cash next time I'm in the area. This is truly some of the best Chinese food I've ever eaten.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"How to do Joe's Shanghai:

Come during ""off"" hours.  I.E., not lunchtime or dinner time.
Be prepared to share a table if you are not a party of five or more.
Order ""soup dumplings"" or xiao long bao and a Tsingtao.  Don't order anything else, it's just mediocre.
Pour yourself some tea while you wait for your food.  The tea also washes down the oil.
Eat and drink.  To eat xiao long bao, put one on your spoon and either have the top or side of the dumpling.  The soup should spill on your spoon and this will help cool it because scalding soup in your mouth sucks.  When cool enough go ahead and eat.  Enjoy your drinks.
Pay in cash when done.  A service charge is already added so if you tip more, you're extremely generous.
Restrooms are in the back of the restaurant and are very basic.
Enjoy the rest of your day!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Their location recently moved to this new location at Bowery. We have always loved soup dumplings and we visit joe Shanghai every single time we visit New York. we always felt joe Shanghai is much better than Din Tai Fung with their amount of soup actually in the dumpling. It has been in few years so we were excited to go back to joe. Good thing we checked on google because we did not realize they had moved from their old Chinatown location. We arrived at 1:45pm on Saturday and had to wait for 30 minutes which we did not mind considering how good these are. We finally made it in and had to share a table which is always the case. The dumplings were good as usual but the service was very very slow. We ordered 3 baskets and it took over 30 mins. Plus, by the time we finished our last basket the last dish still had not arrive yet. We were very disappointed. I am not sure if it's the new kitchen and them working out the kinks but service was less than desirable.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,Came here with a large group (8) and was seated immediately. The soup dumplings and crispy fried shrimp here is a must try! The service here is always super fast and friendly.

Joe's Shanghai,"Ahhhh the famous XLB joint in NYC's Chinatown that been posted on some many foodie IGs that I had to make it out here to try it for myself!!!

Came here on a weekday during the odd hours between lunch and dinner hoping there wasn't going to be a large crowd and we got pretty lucky! Only a few parties ahead of us and waited for about 20 mins!

They do seat you at big circle tables with other parties so be ready for that. I didn't mind because this is popular back in the days for dim sum.

We ordered 2 orders of the XLBs because we wanted to save our bellies for other eats. The XLBs are without a doubt, hella juicy AF. Soupy af. But my parents mentioned that the meat itself was a little dense and I have to agree that the meat was too dense as in hard. It lacked texture. They can def work on that part. Nonetheless, worth a try if you ever visit NYC for it!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This is still the bomb. Explosive juicy bomb. Just order platters of the crab roe soup dumpling and satisfaction will be yours.

Joe's Shanghai,"3.5 stars

Bf and I have tried many different dumpling spots and were excited to try Joe's as we've heard many great things. The restaurant is located in an alley of CT. The tables are communal, meaning you will share a table with strangers whether you like it or not (if your party is big enough, I suppose you may not have to deal with this). Inside is a little run-down and dingy, but expected (still seemed OK to me).

We tried the crab and pork XLB, pork XLB, potstickers, and the fried rice. Love the size, juiciness and soupiness of the XLB. However I was not too drawn to the taste of the dumplings. I probably liked the pork more than the crab + pork combo, but I still think I have had tastier ones. Skin was not too thin or thick imo. I was able to use my chopsticks to pick up the dumplings with ease, no leaking. I appreciate the sizable portions--the dumplings are probably twice the size of standard XLB. I was extremely full by the end of the meal. I don't remember anything too special about the potstickers, but I really liked the fried rice. The fried rice was well-seasoned and the rice was nice and firm with a ton of egg.

Overall a pretty OK experience. There are a ton of people dining in, so expect a wait. But still a good place to try at least once if you're visiting.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"This place is typically packed so while we got to Chinatown, our group went to put our names down for a table. After we got our name in, we opted to go have our ""meal"" at a nearby noodle shop. After we had some noodles, we returned to Joe's.

Joe's is a fairly small restaurant with not too much seating. We came here with only one thing in mind; soup dumplings!  We ended up ordering some scallion pancakes as well.

The soup dumplings have by far been my favorite. We had an order of the pork dumplings, and the crab ones. They were both delicious, but the crab one was my favorite.

The scallion pancakes were probably the best I've had!

I can't wait to come here and try out other food options; the menu looked wonderful.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Awesome place if you are craving dumplings. There were a lot of people when I was there. Place is not too big. The staff was kind and attentive. Bit loud there but the food was good.

Wish there were separate tables.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"We stopped by here after the Lubar Festival parade. Waited 30 minutes for a table to our selves, as they wanted to seat us at a group table.

We weren't offered the free tea mentioned in other reviews.  We ordered both soup dumplings listed as appetizers: the pork and the pork/crab.  They were amazing and filling!  We also ordered the Shanghai noodle that a lot of others on Yelp have raved about, but we thought they were just ""good"".",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Everyone was friendly and enjoyed their own meal/conversations so it wasn't a big deal. If you wanted your own table, you could specify but it'd probably be a much longer wait.

The XLB was one of the best I've ever had! There's so much soup that it nearly filled my whole spoon. They're also cheap and come out quickly! I ordered two (8 pieces each) and it made us both extremely full. I'd high recommend trying their pork XLB - it's worth the hype!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Came here today and it was just alright. Our waiter was speaking to us in multiple languages (english, mandarin and cantonese) a little bit of everything. Which got me confused on what language to respond with. We ordered the cold appetizer, squid which tasted bland as if it was bought from the supermarket in little pouches. We also ordered, 2 orders of crab and pork soup dumplings. In one of the dumplings, it still had pieces of shrimp/crab shell in it. The wrapping was a little thick for my taste. There were a lot of waiters but very unorganized on who takes care of which tables. Decor was nice, clean, bright and new.

The BEST part yet, they automatically charge you ""service fee"" of 18% even if it was only for 2 people. Is this even appropriate to charge gratuity of 18% without the customer's consent? What if the restaurant didn't deserve that much? Would this consider robbing their customers?",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Two thumbs up for this place, this is the literal description of a hole in the wall! I would have never thought of eating here if it wasn't for the great yelp reviews and friend recommendations.

Restaurant is nestled in the middle of Chinatown, unpretentious but hard to miss because of the long line of people waiting to be seated.

Luckily for us, we got there at 11:30 am and didn't have to wait for a table. Tables are comunal which is great! You get to peak at someone else's order and get inspired!

Make sure you bring cash as they don't accept credit cards, we were planing of going to the ATM while waiting to be seated, but since we were sat right away, we had to manage to stay under $40 since that was all the cash we had!

What a pleasant surprise, the prices are extremely reasonable! We managed to get 2 orders of soup dumplings and fried pork dumplings for under $30! All 3 were amazing!!! Make sure you get the dipping sauces, they elevate the dumplings taste!! We ended up asking for sauce refills 3 times!

The dumplings were huuuuge! Couldn't fit a whole soup one in my mouth. We couldn't finish the 3 plates, we were too full! We managed to eat until we couldn't move, get drinks, have a great time, and all for a little over $30! Score!!!

We'll see you soon Joe's Shanghai",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"We were so impressed! Loved the pork soup dumplings--like a flavor explosion. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated on a Thursday night, not bad. The sesame chicken was the best we've ever had. Crispy and light on the outside, juicy on the inside.

Service was fast and efficient. Our friend got the Lo mein, and he loved it! They serve tea at the beginning of the meal, and oranges at the end to refresh.

The seating is communal, which is cool if you're down for that. About 7-8 to a table. It's loud and busy but so fun and a great atmosphere to really experience Chinatown in NYC.

Prices weren't bad at all. Highly recommend! We loved our experience here! We hope to go back next time we're in the city!

The restaurant is pretty small, and it's pretty busy here so don't be surprised if there's a wait. The only thing I wasn't a fan of, was that we had to share a table, which would've been fine if they had asked us first, but basically were just seated and told that we had to share our table with two strangers.

Joe's Shanghai,"It was not only my first time in Chinatown in NYC, but it was also my first time having soup dumplings! The line was kind of long (up to the door), but we got seated quickly, like within 10 minutes. We ordered scallion pancakes to share, which were really good. The highlight of the meal was the pork soup dumplings. It was so much fun to eat and try not to spill the soup. The soup broth was incredibly tasty and not too salty, and the meat inside was amazing to eat. The crispy beef was also amazing and was some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. The other people in our party ordered the General Tsos chicken and we were kind of confused because it was a weird orange chicken/general tsos hybrid. We are still unsure if we got the right dish, especially since they tried serving us the wrong dish before. The waiter also forgot our sides of rice and we had to wait 5-10 minutes to get it. Overall, the food was amazing and my only complaint would be the service, but I know they were trying their best since it was super busy. Also, the place is cash only, so make sure you bring some cash!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"The only thing that separates Joe's from other Chinese restaurants are their crab soup dumplings, so if you're coming here, you better get them, because they're that good.

I've been to the Flushing restaurant before where they really highlight their XLB, and was a bit confused coming to this place when I had to scour the menu to find them (they're under appetizers).  It didn't matter in the end as we ordered one each of the crab and pork soup dumplings.  Unless you really want to try the pork ones, I'd say just go for the crab, as they're so much more flavorful and unique.  The pork ones weren't bad, but they were nothing too special--especially compared to the crab ones.

Between the two of us, two orders of soup dumplings and a plate of string beans was the perfect amount for lunch.  Like with most Chinese restaurants, some of the menu items can be hit or miss, so just be aware that not everything may be as good as the XLB.

The place was pretty crowded for lunch on a weekday, but I swear Chinese restaurants have a hidden spell for getting any sized party to fit at a table no matter how busy they are, so you probably can get a table fairly quickly.  Overall, it's your standard Chinese restaurant that excels at their soup dumplings, but nothing else was that note worthy.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Every six months or so I just have to go down to Joe's. It is like a strong tug on my cravings, especially when the weather gets a bit chilly and the city seems kind of quiet. I especially love when it is a quiet Sunday with no wait. Just perfection.

Once you are seated (whether you waited 30 min, 10 or not at all), you will notice that you are not always at a private table. A party of two often can split a round table with another couple or two. It definitely gives it a different atmosphere but most of the time everyone is too focused on their own delicious meals to care about you stuffing your face. We normally will spilt and order of dumplings and an order of fried rice. The dumplings have a great flavor. The fried rice is not over oily or salted.  They come out quickly and are usually extremely hot. I would assume that you probably will not have tastebuds for the remainder of the day so make sure you order a nice cold beer to wash it all down. But man, it is exactly the thing you needed to satiate the hunger inside.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Be aware this restaurant is very popular so there is going to be a wait. When you get to the door you tell the hostess how many people and she gives you a card with a number on it. After standing outside for 30 min & everyone who came after us was getting called for a table of 2 we knew the hostess messed up & didn't call our number.

She made up for her mistake and rushed us inside but I was still pretty upset.

Seating is family style, you're sat at a table with a bunch of random people, which was a problem..

Caution- the dumpling have soup in them along with the pork or crab you order. We weren't aware my husband grabbed one not knowing tried to eat it whole & burned the entire inside of his mouth it was so hot he spit it into a napkin in his hand and the soup burned his hand too. Three other people at our table had the same thing happened to them. The crab dumplings were extremely fishy. The shrimp friend rice & the spring rolls were really good. (We ordered 2 springs rolls they were cut in half).

Would recommend, just be cautious of how hot the food is.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Famous cash only hole in the wall spot for soup dumplings in Chinatown.

Take a number and wait to be called to get a seat inside. Share a communal table with a bunch of other strangers. I went with my girlfriend on a Saturday for lunch and we waited about 20 min.

Known for pork & crab + pork soup dumplings. They are delicious. Also have complementary tea.

Fast service. Trying to get people in and out as fast as possible.

Also have a large menu of other delicious Chinese staples, however don't go in with any dietary restrictions because the menu doesn't have any descriptions of the dishes.

Joe's Shanghai,"Joe's Shanghai was one of those places that constantly popped up when searching for the must eat food in NY. Came here on a Thursday afternoon and got seated immediately. Ordered their famous xiao long baos and green beans. The greens beans were def passable, but def go for the XLBs. They were on the bigger side and had so much soup in it. Ohh also their bathroom was surprisingly super clean!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Joe's Shanghai,"Here's the thing. People go to Joe's to try soup dumplings, because most places in the country don't have them. And they are delicious. They are also made with lava inside, so punch a hole in them or take a little bit to let them cool, lest you set your facehole on fire and lose the ability to taste anything else. And you should taste other things, too, because Joe's has so much more than soup dumplings. Fried rice cakes with shrimp is another thing. Cold sesame noodles. Fried pork dumplings. About 170 other dishes.
Here is my one issue with the place. It is really popular, and as such, they can pull off communal seating and a really weird scheme for seating you and your group. My group of 4 waited about 15 minutes when we were called. Then, we were put inside in on-deck-circle, waiting in a totally in the way area for another 10 minutes, waiting for space to open up. We spent that time getting closer and closer to one another as people came up to the register for one reason or another, even though the wait staff will take your money at the table. Whatever. This would not work in a place less amazing.

The Margarita pie, and pizza special No. 2 are amazing, probably in the top 2 pizzas places we have ever been to. Pizzas are well packed and keep well. We drove for 20 minutes and the pizza was still relatively warm when we got home. This was a great experience and can't wait to to back when things open back up.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"We ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza, and side of meatballs. The pizza is thin crust and absolutely delicious.

Will definitely order from them again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I was disappointed with Grimaldi's before and realized it was just touristy and that was all, but I was actually pretty impressed with Juliana's. The restaurant isn't too big. It looks pretty clean and the oven is in the back in an open area.

We ordered the classic margherita and white pizza. They did half and half for us without extra charge which I was surprised to see. Usually, some places charge a lot more extra for half and half but this popular restaurant didn't really charge. Definitely get this if there aren't too many people in your party and you want to try different pizza. I liked both margherita and white pizza equally. The cheese wasn't salty at all and I could tell they use great quality ingredients especially the cheese.

The place is definitely worth a try and live up to its hype. But check it out on a weekday as on weekends during summer time tends to be over an hour wait at the least.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Living up the hill from this place the past several years and seeing the lines of tourists form seemingly everyday here, I always tried to avoid Juliana's.

Well, we decided to venture down and give them a try via pandemic take-out. There was a line, but they text you about 10 minutes after your order to pick it up. Efficient!

Medium cheese pie was perfect for two people. Cheese was light, sauce was sweet, crust was nicely charred. A simple, yet effective, coal fire pizza. Extremely popular among tourists, although I honestly would compare Juliana's pizza to Table 87's as they basically taste the same.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I've heard mixed reviews about this place but I finally decided to give it a try.

Me and my boyfriend waited about 40 minutes on a Sunday afternoon around 3:30PM. It seems they do not allow entry between a certain time, likely to clean and prepare for next wave of customers.

The host was friendly and seated us in an orderly fashion.  The waiter was quick to take our order and our pizza came out in about 10-15 minutes.

We ordered a medium half white and half margarita pizza to share. The pizza was thin but held together nicely. In terms of taste, the white pizza had a spongey consistency. The mozzarella was chewy and not what I expected. As the pizza cooled, the mozzarella only got chewier. The margarita pizza was ok but nothing out of the ordinary.

Overall, I would not wait in line again for pizza. The restaurant has a nice ambiance and is clean, which I believe adds to the experience of eating ""fancy pizza"".",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Juliana's Pizza,"Overall Score: 3.75 Stars (Expected More)

After waiting in line, we ordered a Marguerite pizza. Took 25-30' to come and it was barely warm! It was also soggy in the middle!! This from a ""World's Best Pizza""?

The pizza making operation is pretty cool, so the not hot and soggy pizza made no sense, however as we had no patience to wait for another one and we ate it!

I wouldn't rate this pizza even in the top 10 in the area and when you consistently boast hour wait lines, you should be one of the best.  This product is clearly not.  

Go wait in line at Lucali, that is worth it.

Juliana's Pizza,"As quarantine continues, my trekking to Brooklyn for NY-style pizza continues. I figured to go to Juliana's since it's the sister of the famous Grimaldi's which I absolutely adore. Unfortunately I was left rather disappointed (which is okay, it's a personal preference and I'm still glad I got to try it in these rather difficult times). The good is that the price point and service is spot on. It was $50 not including tip for a personal pie (which can easily be split amongst 2, maybe 3 people- and I eat a lot) and a large pie. You simply call, place an order, and give them your credit card info. When I got there I told the waitress my name and she brought my pies out and they were still hot.
Anyways, we got the special pie number 1 which consisted of mozzarella, pancetta, scallions and no tomato sauce and a regular pie with sausage. White pies typically aren't my go-to but I've been pleasantly surprised before. Unfortunately, this one fell short since there was barely any pancetta in it and I barely tasted any scallions. In addition to that, the dough was just off and the same could be said about the sausage pie (which was better but still wasn't amazing). Basically, it was chewy versus crispy and the texture of the dough and crust is what makes or breaks a pizza IMHO. No, the crust doesn't need to be as thin as a cracker but it just wasn't good. Even with a bottle of vino I was left feeling underwhelmed (and it's hard to beat pizza and vino for a casual dinner). Either way, I am glad Juliana's is still open during these times but their pizza is not for me- would much rather go for Grimaldi's next door because trust me when I say it's definitely better despite the same ownership.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I placed my order on their website for curbside pick up, received a text when it was ready, stood in the pickup queue and my order was brought out to me. I got the margherita pizza.

Definitely hit the pizza craving spot!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I thought I found my go-to pizza but if you are in Brooklyn, definitely try this place. I stumbled upon this place after an evening stroll exploring Brooklyn and just wanted a nice place to sit, keep warm and have comfort food and pizza sounded just right.

I had a large pizza with prosciutto and cheese and let me tell you, it is perfect to share with 2-4 people. The pizza was large but a good size and quality. The place will make you feel like you are at home and the place is really clean. If you are in Brooklyn, pay this place a visit!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Since the Covid-19 situation prevented customers to dine in, Juliana's has started to offer delivery and take out. You can order by calling them directly or via their website. I think this was a great move as it allows us to continue to support them during these rough times. The only consideration I would say is that you may experience long wait times before you get your food since they are often busy. Not a big problem though as you should just put in your order earlier. I highly recommend trying the classic Margherita and adding sausage. Juliana's is consistently putting out quality pizzas and the service is quite good.

Juliana's Pizza,"Ate here once last year and came back again today! Now that I moved to NYC, I'm definitely ready to go back whenever. Party of 4 came on Saturday night at around 7:30 pm and we only waited for 5 minutes!! Perhaps heavy rain and strong winds in the afternoon prevented people from going out, but rain stopped and we were ready to eat some famous Brooklyn pizza at Juliana's!

Here is what we got:
-Half Margherita Pizza (tomato, mozzarella, basil) with pepperoni and mushroom toppings.
-Half White Pizza (mozzarella and garlic) with sausage and sweet onion toppings.
-3 soft drinks and 1 lemonade

*We ordered 1 more Large Pizza of the same thing because it was just that delicious. I swear we weren't hungry; we had a heavy meal only 2 hours before!

There are additional charges to each topping you order (ranges from $2-$6), but it is well worth it. Both pizzas were EXTREMELY good; I prefer the margherita because it was more flavorful and we picked the right toppings for it. White pizza was good too; once you dip it with hot sauce, you will be speechless.  Reasonable prices--2 large pizzas with drinks came out to be $93 and it was well worth it!

Overall, this place isn't a tourist trap. They serve the best pizza in NYC and you won't be disappointed with their amazing pizza made from the freshest ingredients. Our server was also AMAZING! He was really attentive, friendly, and communicative. I believe his name was Damal? Have to go back and get his name again. Thank you!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"The pizza was good but nothing too special. Appreciated the great service though, especially for our largeish group of 8.

We had our last meals of 2019 (the decade!) here on NYE, after a brutal game of laser tag @ Area 53. I believe we waited only about 10-15 min outside before getting seated - not bad at all, especially for prime dinner time (7pm). Inside was way cozier than I had imagined and once we were all settled into our seats, we were warmly welcomed by our server who was an older gentleman. He was kind, patient, personable and funny even for a pretty busy night - I expected to get rushed but he was the opposite of that.

We ordered the following large special pies to share (8 slices per pie):

- No. 1 ($32: white pie w/ pancetta, white truffles in olive oil, etc.) -- Unfortunately the pancetta (Italian bacon) was just too salty for most of us. We agreed that we wouldn't really recommend.

- No. 2 ($30: white pie w/ sliced cherry tomatoes, garlic, etc.) -- Wow, the pieces of garlic on this pie were not a joke! There were legit huge, visible garlic chunks on each slice which made this pie pretty good. Not my favorite but not bad. I remember it being kind of watery.

- No. 4 ($32: tomato pie w/ arugula and prosciutto) -- I personally didn't have any of this one but it seemed like the crowd favorite. Everyone enjoyed it.

- No. 6 ($32: white pie w/ grilled chicken, guacamole, etc.) -- ""...Interesting,"" some had described it as... lol. I also didn't get to try this one but I'm guessing this take on a California-style pizza was a lil too eccentric for the group.

Perhaps we didn't really pick the right pies (maybe we missed out on No. 3, lol) and I'm very curious about their standard Margherita pie. Will need to check that one out next time. I can't compare to Grimaldi's just yet but again, standout, solid service with pretty standard prices.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I've tried and ranked a lot of pizza places in New York City and this is by far the easiest 5/5 star and my favorite pizza in all of NYC. The pizza is so spectacular, it made the wait for an hour so worth it.

I got the margherita pie with half of it with meatballs and half with sausage. Also got a half margherita pie and half white pie. My ranking would be meatballs, margherita, white slice, sausage. However, can't go wrong with any of them - definitely get toppings along with plain pizza to try the best of both worlds! The thin crust was also to die for - so delicious.

Juliana's Pizza,"This review is for Juliana's located at Time Out Market at Dumbo's Empire Stores at 55 Waters Street on the fifth floor.   Juliana's comes from the legendary Patsy Grimaldi known for its Margherita thin crust pizza.

This is a great location, come here and avoid the long lines and wait at the main tourist attraction pizzereria.  They use the same coal fired pizza oven and the views are much better as well.

I have had pizza around the world and Juliana's is truly the best pizza I have ever had in my life.  No pizza like this anywhere on the planet. I had the white pizza and I was over joyed with the thin crust and flavor. The Vanilla Egg Cream was  heavenly.  The cannoli was a fabulous ending.

I am still dreaming of my day at Dumbo Timeout Market and my amazing meal at Juliana's.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Finally made it out to Patsy Grimaldi's finale and it was certainly worth the trip to Dumbo. Literally right down the street from 'actual' Grimaldi's (which Patsy Grimaldi sold in 1998...apparent without the forethought of a non-compete clause), Juliana's boasts a nightly line just like it's older step brother. I was part of a part of four on a Friday around 6PM and just missed a wave of seating, but were seating within 30-40 mins.

The seating is pretty cozy, sometimes having to squeeze in between tables to get to/from bathroom trips or whatnot, but I'm all for more seating/availability overall, a necessary evil with limited space.

Drink-wise, Juliana's offers pretty thorough wine list (by glass or bottle) and several beers on taps, along with standard issue soft drinks/coffees and, of course, their famed egg cream.

Food-wise, while the menu does have an array of appetizers and some pastas...c'mon, you know why you're here. Pizza. And filling-up/wasting precious tummy space on anything else is shameful and amateurish.

Being a party of 4, we opted for a large margherita pie and a medium No. 1 specialty pie.

Margherita pie (I always try to get a 'basic' pie at a new spot; gotta try the base model without the flare) - friggin delightful! Chewy crust, but no flop, this was some top notch pizza; the 'Grimaldi' quality was evident.

No. 1 Specialty Pie (mozzarella, scamorza affumicata, pancetta, scallions and Oregon-grown white truffles in olive oil - i.e., sans sauce) - while I'm generally a fan of the saucy pies, the table was intrigued by this so we went for it. The pie was decadent and pretty good, but between the multiple cheese and pancetta, it was a wee tad bit (...kind of really) salty. Tasty, but maybe if this had some sauce to dilute, could have been a home run.

An overall experience that did not disappoint. Juliana's is certainly a 'must' on any pizza tour/list, if not just for the history lesson. After my limited first-time visit, I'd recommend sticking to the basics, which truly showcase the tradition of pizza excellence. Yum.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Grimaldi's is next door but had been told that Juliana's is better so I waited in line before they opened at 4.  

Oh my goodness. I'm not usually a fan of thin crust pizza because I LOVE crust, but this is by far my most favorite pizza spot hands down. The cheesiness of the N1 was stringy and the crust was not soggy at all. The crust was evenly cooked, which you can tell from grabbing a slice from the tray and the pizza not dipping at the end.

Try this place out. It's worth the wait!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"We arrived at Juliana's right before 4pm and people were already lining up at the door. (They're closed 3:15pm - 4:00pm to stoke the fire in their oven) We were seated right away and ordered the Margherita Pizza. The pizza came out super fast and was delicious. It was a little burnt on the bottom for my liking, but my teen boys didn't mind at all. We devoured the entire pizza and were on our way to our next stop within 30 minutes of sitting down. If you are in Brooklyn, I would recommend stopping at Juliana's. We were there during the Coronavirus outbreak and the staff was doing everything they could to space people out, and keep everything clean and they still provided great service with great attitudes.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

The place is not as big as I had expected and the tables have been squished quite close to each other! Well, I would go through this all for a good pizza!

The Margherita Pizza(extra topping - arugula):
I have a thing For the classic margarita pizza. Just the right purée and mozzarella plus basil. We decided to experiment a little and added arugula. This pizza was so so good! The crush isn't chewy. The pizza is thin and not sloppy at all. The arugula adds a nice crunch to it and blends well. The mozzarella is in abundance!

White Pizza(extra toppings - olives):
The white pizza with garlic and mozzarella is so good. We made one blunder. We asked for olives on our pizza. That made the pizza quite sour. I love white pizza with garlic and this was just perfect! This is a must order!

Pinot Noir Mark West, California - Our server recommended this wine with the pizza. All pizzas are loaded with cheese and it makes your throat  dry. The wine is semi dry and not too sweet. Was great along with our dinner! However, 12$ for a glass of regular wine is a tad too much.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I was surprised how tiny the place was. Nonetheless, I stopped in at an off hour (around 4, just after they reopen from a period of prepping their oven) and had no trouble finding a seat. The bar style seating enabled me to watch my pizza being made, and there was some entertaining throwing of dough and such.

I asked my waiter to recommend either peppers or mushrooms as a topping for my pizza, and got an answer that this would be like choosing between Picasso and Rembrandt. I went with shiitake mushrooms. The pie that resulted was a substantial diameter even in medium size. It wasn't so much that there was a clear hierarchy of tomato sauce with cheese on top and mushrooms on top of that, the ingredients were sort of mixed together. And they were fantastic.

Normally I try to save the slice with the best looking bubbles or char for last, but it was hard to choose because most of the slices had those qualities. The crust delivered a pleasantly roasted taste and just a hint of softness despite being thin, and the sauce and cheese were top shelf, made New York style with the addition of basil leaves and crushed oregano. The mushrooms were a perfectly good choice; they didn't detract from the flavors at all, but they added some substance. This was a top notch pizza.

I can't comment on its place in the New York pizza pantheon because I don't know enough (yet). But it's a damn good pizza.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"The pizza was good, a little well done underneath but I was fine with it and the kids liked the pizza too. It's in a tough spot being near Grimaldi's, but it seems to be very popular.  A lot of people stopped by to pickup pizza they ordered in advance. Do I think it's as good as Grimaldi's? No. Did I enjoy the pizza and would I eat here again? Yes. Only negative, they didn't have any chicken toppings today.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

If you are looking have a nice day/night out in dumbo this is a great spot to get a thin pizza that is delicious.

I came here 2hrs before closing on a Saturday and it was perfect as I got a spot right away infront of the pizza oven. This was the best as I'm waiting for my pizza I get to see the pros at work. It was really hot out so the waiter kept pouring the water which was great cause I was dehydrated.

We got the Marinara pizza to keep it simple and it hit the spot. It's a nice size pizza and was perfect for 2.

Juliana's Pizza,"I don't know if Juliana's is a tourist attraction or a Brooklyn staple but we were hungry and were in Brooklyn on our way to Brooklyn Bridge. We looked for pizza places and came across Juliana's. I thought there was a line formed outside and it was some kind of a place to grab pizza by the slice LOL. I am so glad that I was wrong because we were in line before the place had even opened. We were lucky enough to get in after standing in for maybe a little over half an hour. After us the line just sort of kept getting longer and longer. Now onto the pizza.

I had half margherita half white pizza. The margherita pizza was left unadulterated with no extra toppings. It was perfect with the mozzarella, tomato sauce (OMG), and basil. The white side had cremini mushrooms and garlic. The marg was perfection. The tomato sauce probably is made with some magical ingredients because it puts a spell on you once you have a bite of it. I knew I could never eat pizza anywhere else again. Sadly, I don't live in NYC so I will just have to keep going back for this treat. The white pizza was also pretty amazing. The mushrooms added so much flavor and the garlic really made the sauce tasted even more pronounced. I don't even know how else to describe it.

Our server was very busy so once he found us he apologized for the delay and was extremely hospitable for the remainder of our time there. It was immediately in that moment that I knew I was a Juliana's fan for life.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"So I gave into the hype and had to try this place.
Half margherita half white were the flavors of choice. For both sides of the pizza, the cheese had a very not cheesy texture. It's almost hard to describe. It makes me wonder
Is that just the way mozzarella is but if I compare it to pizza I've had in Italy, I can say it's not the mozzarella. It was a weird, spongey texture that didn't pull apart. Whatever that was, I was not into it. Whether this is legit and genuine, it just created a weird taste for me. It wasn't horrible. But it wasn't that great either. The crust was good. Thin but not too overly thin and still maintained a good chewy bite. Overall, it wasn't what I expected.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Juliana's was founded by the original Grimaldi's founder, after he sold the the restaurant and went into retirement. Grimaldi later came out of retirement and having lost the right to the ""Grimaldi"" name founded Juliana's after his mother.

I had high hopes from Juliana's hearing the crust was thinner and the sauce slightly sweeter than Grimaldi's. After waiting ~40 minutes my party of 2 was seated. The interior is cute and spacious. Waiters are fast and efficient.

We ordered the medium Margarita with cremini mushrooms and sweet onions. It's definitely enough for two.

We also ordered the chocolate and vanilla egg creams; basically chocolate/vanilla ice cream with seltzer. They're lighter, thinner and more than a regular milkshake. Super refreshing! I'd get this again.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I don't think I have ever been more hyped to try a place than I did for Juliana's. My interest obviously piqued because of the whole Juliana's vs. Grimaldi's pizza war, but all the reviews backed up the claim that Juliana's was one of the best pizzas out there. So on my trip to the city, you knew this was #1 on my list!

I did take my friend's recommendation and come here at 11 am to get in line before the restaurant opened at 11:30 am. I wasn't about to wait an hour or possibly longer in pulverizing summer heat. Ended up being part of the first round of tables, so it was worth coming early!

Despite my initial desire to get TWO pizzas (yes, it would've been for da gram), I thought better of it and got a split large pizza of (1) margherita with extra mozzarella and (2) white pizza with ricotta and sausage. Let me first say...damn I know how to make a FINE white pizza. Now that I'm done with the boasting, Juliana's is quite honestly THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD. The ingredients are just so unbelievably a step above any other pizza I've ever had. The tomato sauce is on point, the cheese is delectable, and the pizza dough is just that perfect level of chewiness and crispiness. Combine all that together and you have heaven in your mouth. I'm literally dreaming of this pizza while writing this review, so that should tell you how I feel about Juliana's.

Service here is excellent. Waiters give you time to make your decision without pressuring you, but also keep things moving along. And the pies don't take too long to come out. All in all, no complaints from me on this front.

As I ate the remainder of my leftover Juliana's on the plane ride back, the only thing I could think about was the next time I was coming here. I hyped it up so much in my head, and it delivered and then some. Can't wait to come back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,Amazing pizza. Thin crust from all angles. I like how they lightly season their food to let the flavor shine and/or accommodate personal tasting preference. Waited for about 20' in line but this was worth every second of it.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"A medium will take care of 5-6 individuals, however, with a huge craving, 4 pizza can be part between 2 individuals. The outside layer has an extraordinary taste and new fixings, you can't turn out badly with this spot. Coke bottles were presumably 8oz, so it may not be sufficient to wash everything down. The spot is little however situated a lot of individuals.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"def one of my must-drop-by spots when in NY
the pizza is utter perfection IMO
the crust has the perfect amount of crunchy/crispy/chewy/doughy-ness
while the sauce has enough zing but not too much
where it tastes bitter or overpowering
the cheese is probably favorite part
sweet, creamy, stretchy(!)

i skip the line and order it to go
and eat it around the corner near the water",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Phenomenal pizza! I always see a line for this place, but now I understand why. Thankfully the line moves pretty fast. I got there around 8pm on a weeknight and we were able to be seated in less than 20 minutes for a table of 2. One waiter was managing half the restaurant and he was doing a pretty darn good job. He took 3 orders at once and was able to get all of our drinks out simultaneously.

Our food came out about 15 minutes after ordering. We ordered the margherita pizza and it was great. The crust was thin and made a great crunch. The ingredients tasted very fresh. They have an open kitchen in which you can see the workers knead the dough and fire the pizza. There are 2 restrooms (both unisex): 1 upstairs and the other in the basement.

Would definitely recommend this place and I want to come back to try all their options.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I think it's unlikely I'll voice any opinion here that hasn't already been said ad nauseam. It IS delicious. It IS from the amazing/talented folks who brought you Grimaldi's. It IS super convenient and easy.

I didn't even have a reservation and came in for a quick order. Was seated at the bar by the super nice and helpful hostess. I ended up ordering the No. 1 specialty pizza which was expertly cooked. The vibe of the restaurant is homey and intimate, with images of the storied family lining the walls and a giant brick oven in the back. The tastes conjured by the artists are fresh, authentic, and always seem to hit the spot.

Come through fam, it's amazing.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"We started waiting in the line at 5:30 and we got sat at down at the bar in 15min. The staff were efficient and friendly

The bar has the best seats if you like to see how your pizza is made

We got the medium Margherita pizza and added sausage. They were generous with the topping. The pizza tasted pretty good and well balanced in terms of sauce, to topping ratio.

The only complaint I have is that I didn't enjoy the mozzarella. It was melted but tasted rubbery for my liking.

I would come back and try another pizza.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I don't have the foggiest idea how they got the notoriety for being the best pizza in NYC or possibly the universe, however, it hasn't helped them undoubtedly. In the event that you come here reasoning the pizza is going to transform you or it's going to some way or another be better than other great pizza. They utilize quality fixings and they have a decent wood-consuming stove. In any case, there are presumably 100 different spots that do something very similar and eventually, you're simply dwelling on silly trifles. There's just such a lot of you can do with pizza. I don't know ANY pizza merits sitting tight in line for quite a while. In the event that the line is long, head off to someplace else.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Visiting the homie and he recommended this spot. Here was our experience on a Friday evening.

AMBIANCE:
Parking: Brooklyn and a popping side, thus good luck with street parking, best taking public transportation to get here

Seating: Mainly inside with room for about 30 people. Groups or pairs.

Feels:
If you're looking for something scenic and delicious, you're in the right spot. You have a gorgeous view of Manhattan in a touristy spot. The restaurant itself is pretty small and intimate. For one of the semi-higher end pizza taste, this is your spot.

FOOD:
No. 1 (Recommend)
Love love love, quite simple yet delicious. The cheeses of mozzarella and scamorza affumicata was pleasant and gooey. Panceta provided some savory protein and the white truffle base was delightful. The crust was thin, crispy and not burnt....delicious!

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
Nice! Friendly people, good food.

TL; DR OVERALL:
4 Stars. The pizza was delicious, the service was great, vibes were pleasant. There may be hundreds of pizza spots in NY but this had a pleasant charm to it. I wouldn't mind coming back here....my oh my that cheese was so good.

Tips:
* Come early, this spot is no hidden gem.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"As good as it gets for thin crust coal fired pizza. We went for a late lunch on a Sunday and had no wait (line can be long in rush time). We ordered 2 large pies for 3 (yes, it was way too much, but we ate it all).

One was the margherita, nice and light. the other was the prosciutto (special) and had more flavor and more ingredients. Both pizzas were fantastic.

Service was friendly and the atmosphere is laid back. Would certainly recommend if you are looking for pizza in the Dumbo area.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"If there's a LONG line you know it's good right?! Well maybe...

We waited in line for over 30 minutes and got sat at one of the few tables outside for lunch. It was a nice day out so that table was fine but...all the hungry people in line beside us wasn't the best feeling. Still, I was happy to get a table.

Our waiter took awhile to greet us for our drink order but gave decent service after he did. They stay packed here and he had a lot more tables inside.

We ordered the Caesar salad with anchovies and olives added then the medium Margherita pizza. The medium was plenty for two. And it was delish! The salad is a large portion to share and the pizza is perfection.

Their pizza is cooked by a coal oven and I saw many people sitting inside fanning themselves. I went inside to use the bathroom and confirmed, it was hot! Outside seating may be best if you don't want to overheat.

Another thing to note....they close from 3-4. We were lucky enough to get sat before this cutoff but if you aren't then you'll have to wait an hour before they begin sitting people again..or give up your spot in line.

There is also another location very close in the TimeOut Market with the same food and no wait. I felt this location was more of an experience but next time I would just go there instead of waiting.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"BEST PIZZA EVER. And as someone whose main food group is pizza by a long shot, I don't say that lightly!

I found Juliana's just walking around Brooklyn one day, I typed ""pizza"" into google maps and it brought me here. It opened in about 15 minutes and there was already a line, so I jumped in and luckily was seated in the first round of people. I was seated at the bar and I got to watch them make the pizzas while I ate which was so cool! I ordered the margerita pizza and it was unbelievable. Perfectly thin crust, just charred enough around the edges to give it some crunch. The sauce was amazing, just the right amount of cheese, I seriously can't say enough good things about this.

I didn't live in the city at the time and I went home and talked about this pizza to anyone who would listen. When I moved up here a few months later I insisted on coming here before anyone else with my boyfriend and family. They were all equally impressed! Would highly recommend to anyone in any situation. You have to go here!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"This is definitely a must go when visiting Brooklyn. We had to wait almost an hour but it was 100% worth it!!

It was nice because there was a water container and cups for the people in line to drink if they're thirsty. I came with 2 other friends and we were hungry!

When we finally arrived to the restaurant, we were seated near the back which was really fascinating because we got to see the process of the pizza making. We ended up ordering the caesar salad which was very yummy because it wasn't too heavy...probably to prepare for the amazing pizza. For pizza, we shared a large and had half margarita and half white sauce! Between the three of us, we were full and satisfied with our order. I ordered a wine but they must have forgetter to give it to me but that's okay because I didn't even need wine to enjoy the amazing pizza.

Anyways, I am going here again! And recommending anyone reading it to go here. To this day, I still think about this pizza.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC. A must try pizzaria if you are in NYC, or visiting. The crust, the crunch, the sauce, the cheese....it was probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had in my life!

We came to Juliana's because our family members (NYC natives) invited us to dinner and advised us ""YOU HAVE TO HAVE JULIANA's""....We've had our share of pizzas so we were ready to add this one to our list.

The restaurant is so intimate, its life a legit room, very tight. However, it gives you that cool Brooklyn DT vibe. I liked it. We ordered 3 large pizzas, and meatballs....yea everything was straight perfections.

The meatballs were so classic, and the pizza was phenomenal. The crust was crunchy, chewy, with the perfect amount of salt, and the housemade sauce was tart and perfect. The food came out hot and fresh right out of the oven.

But wait, there's more! After your eating, head out the door to your right, on the boardwalk to see the perfect view of the NYC skyline. It makes for the perfect dinner evening!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Service was great!

Overall, this place is worth its hype.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"This is was my second time at Juliana's and there wasn't any doubt that it wouldn't be as great as the first time. Both times I was able to get seated right away which was a plus. Specially if the wait times can be long sometimes. The have an outdoor heater in case you do wait in the cold. One of the staff members came out and greeted us. Don't know if it was the owner or not but his presence was very much appreciated.

I ordered two pies and two orders of meatballs. The pies are cooked in a coal oven which takes a few minutes to be ready. The bottoms of the pies are subject to a little darker than usual but if you don't like that I would be cautious and see if you can have less on the cook time. I don't know how they handle that. We had one half pepperoni and half white and the second pie was prosciutto and arugula. Always super delicious and couldn't get any better than this. You get three giant meatballs per order and that sauce though. My guests said it was the best meatballs they've ever had.

Overall, I will always be coming back to Juliana's, one of my favorites in New York City. Keep up the good work.

When we got there, there was a line... As expected because if it's popularity.
We decided to order to go and enjoy it outside since the weather wasn't terrible.

We ordered one margarita pizza to share and it was delicious! Pizza so thin yet crust so crispy. So flavorful

Definitely worth it",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"To be honest, I wasn't that impressed with Juliana's whatsoever. Prior to coming here, I'd heard many great things about the pizza. I've been to Grimaldi's and Patsy's, which both serve better pies and have better service.

Let me explain.

From the beginning, the staff was borderline rude. I came here with my parents, as they were visiting me in Brooklyn for the first time. Unfortunately, the staff was not very welcoming whatsoever, and our server was quite snooty. He was abrupt and refused to work with us on a billing error at the conclusion of our dinner.

Regarding the pie itself, the ingredients were good for sure. However, a large pie is not very large, especially not for $30.  I'm certainly not saying it didn't have good flavor, because that would not be true. But to pay $30 for a large pie that was medium-sized, plus poor service - that's a little much, I think. I will likely not be coming back here.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I've at the very least dabbled in Brooklyn pizza as much as one can living all the way over in Los Angeles. But after trying out both the red and white pies at Juliana's I'm a firm believer that the hype here is well deserved.

Points of comparison for this review include:

Roberta's: 5 Stars
Emily: 4 Stars
Peppino's: 4 Stars
Franny's: 3 Stars

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Both the service and atmosphere at Juliana's are fantastic. These servers are genuinely top notch, and they contribute to what is a lively and authentic feeling atmosphere. Yes, the lines can apparently grow quite long, but they handle it with queuing outside and a refined system. My pie came out quickly, which was appreciated. Star.

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Literally today, while writing this review back in Los Angeles, I paid $25 for a crappy pepperoni pizza. At Juliana's, I paid $23.00 for a 'small' half and half red and white that was of comparable size. Point being, there's great value here at Juliana's. Star.

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Both halves of this pizza were exceptionally good. I realized I'm more of a white pie guy, and that's partially because the garlic and ricotta on that half of this pizza was exceptional. The only bad thing I have to say about the pizza is that while the crust had the right amount of chew, it was missing that unique flavor that you find at Roberta's. Just an observation. Single Star.

Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?

Juliana's is rightfully applauded, and I'd be excited to go back. Star.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Juliana's was recommended to us by our tour guide, and it didn't disappoint. Luckily we got there just before the noon lunch rush started and managed to grab a couple seats at the bar. It was a little toasty up front since we were close to the oven, but it was nice to see the pizzas being made right in front of you. Service was okay, with our waiter just seeming to go through the motions. Could have been more attentive, but the place was packed.

We decided to share the #4 special pizza, which was topped with tomatoes, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto. They definitely didn't skimp on the arugula or prosciutto! I like how the pizza was slightly charred and thin, but not too thin. Loved how you could taste the freshness of all the ingredients. A small is definitely more than enough for two people to share.

I also tried some of the Brooklyn style egg cream, which I thought was interesting. Not as sweet as I thought it would be. Reminded me of a Coke float.

If you are in the area and in the mood for pizza, check out Juliana's!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Everything was really good except wait for ever!

We sit inside which I recommend too because of noisy and ppl watching your food outside.

I put order a half white half margarita! It was a good choice! Pizza is oven baked and very fresh and crust was very Crunchy!!!

As an appetizer, they bring bread. We order a bottle of wine.

I suppose one pizze is enough for a couple ( not  hungry as a schoolboy, neither feeling peckish)!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

My friend and I stood in the scorching heat with no shade for a good 15 minutes and thankfully we were one of the first ones in line.

The pizza was definitely worth the wait - Italian style pizza that's thinner than New York style. A light crust with tangy sauce and mozzarella from heaven.

The only disappointment was the salad that was drenched in dressing, but the pizza made up for it.

There's also a location inside the Time Out market that offers a smaller personal pie.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Don't let the line scare you away!!!

This place is extraordinary!!! The line was long but we didn't wait more than half an hour to be seated. As soon as we were seated, a waiter came to us and took our order. Then another gentleman came and brought water to the table.
My boyfriend and I stood up to go to the restroom to wash our hands and by the time we came back to the table, the first two pizzas we ordered were seating with my sister waiting for us.

Their service is SPLENDID, and honestly, they are much faster than Flash.

We ordered two large pizzas: a classic Margherita and Special No. 1, thinking it was more than enough and that we would take a few slides home. Yeah right!!!! We were left wanting MORE, specially me and my twin sister, who convinced our partners to get another one.

I can't explain with words how good their pizzas taste. Their salsa is simply delightful. It was also my first time having pizza without tomato sauce and it was simply PERFECT!!!!!!
If you wish to understand what I mean with ""can't be explained with words"", go, review and rate!!!

Juliana's Pizza,"Came here on a Thursday afternoon with some friends after a buddy claimed this was one of the best pizza spots and a Brooklyn favourite. We got a large margherita pie and a large calzone which was enough for three people. The calzone had a nice and crispy outside without being too hard. The ricotta cheese on the inside was just oozing out and quite hot - most of it honestly falls out by the time the piece gets to your mouth so you really gotta try to be careful with it because the slices of calzone are quite fragile and somewhat falling apart.

Now for pizza. The mozzarella was really nice and chewy and made for some solid cheese pulls. It arrives quite hot but certainly not hot enough to burn your mouth, at least in my experience; you can dig in right away. Immediately the basil flavour just pops out at you and takes over your taste buds, followed by the marinara which was quite mild and one of the least sweet ones I've had. Other places seem to put sugar in their sauce (which I don't mind!) but this one appears to be a little more bare bones. The crust is lightly charred with a nice and crispy finish. We had a dope waiter as well and he made it quite nice with pleasant, attentive and non invasive service. All in all I would say I had an enjoyable experience.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

We ordered the margherita and the pizza no 4. My friends and I by far liked the margherita pizza more. It was good and the crust was nicely thin and crispy. Something about the arugula and prosciutto didn't mesh well with pizza no 4. It was not worth an hour wait in the cold. I also wouldn't say I liked it more than other pizza places in New York.

Juliana's Pizza,"Spent an afternoon enjoying the Brooklyn Heights Promenade when hunger got the best of us. Juliana's is surrounded by a Starbucks, Shake Shack and 2 other pizza places but by our cravings and the Yelp reviews, Juliana's won hands down.

Ambient on the inside, the menu was limited but equally hard to decide from. We opted to go traditional and simply enjoy a good NY style charcoal-fired pizza. We ordered a Matt's Mix salad with spinach, tomatoes, peppers, olives and onions with OO and vinegar. I'm not a pepper person but the freshness of all the ingredients could be tasted in every bite, and those peppers tasted like salad candy.

With our hard time deciding we went for a half Margherita half White pizza as per recommendation from our server Trimell, who knew we were first timers. Both were amazing but the Margherita was my favorite. The freshness of the tomato and basil was everything. The pizza was thin in bread but not overly crunchy with just the right cheese to sauce ratio. Since it was two of us sharing a 16"", we passed up on eating too much of the crust to make sure we got through the delicious topped pizza part of the pie.

Shout out to our server Trimell, epic in service and attentive without being annoying. Had charm and interest in ensuring we had a good time and experience.

I thought the pizza was wonderful but do not think I'll be returning just because of the wait. From what I hear and read, this wait is typical. However, if you have the time definitely come here and get the classic cheese pie. I will say once we got inside, the service was very quick.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I don't know what all the fuss is about.
The pizza was just OK in my opinion.
So was the service.
The guys make your pizza with no hair nets or gloves which creeped me out a little.... am i the only one ?
Anyways it's hella expensive, three meatballs were $14.00 just for starters.
Pic of the receipt so you guys can see for yourself.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"My husband insisted on driving a whole 45 min just to get here on our trip because he heard the pizza was excellent. Traffic getting here is a nightmare. But we finally get to the restaurant and be prepared for a massive wait/line! When we got in, we ordered the salad that comes with chick peas and avocado for an extra charge. After asking for extra dressing, I found the salad to be delicious. We also ordered a meatball app. It comes with three large meatballs that were very good. Now for pizza you have limited options. You can build your own but are only allowed 2 toppings. From the list of pizza options that come pre-set with toppings, only one of them has tomato sauce. So we chose to build our own with mushrooms and pepperoni. The pizza was sooooo good. It's piping hot with an excellent flavor. At the end we ordered the cookie/ice cream dessert which was good.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,This spot was recommended by SO many people when I told them I was going to Brooklyn. The line was extremely long but we went ahead and ordered the pizza as take out and it was literally done in 20 minutes while the line to get seated was a 60-90 minute wait. The menu is limited and they actually have a lot of veggie options and less meat options. We ordered 2 large pies and it was the perfect amount for the 6 of us (we had big eaters!).  The #1 was my favorite!! It had thick pancetta and fresh mozzarella that was phenomenal. It didn't have any tomato sauce which at first I thought was slightly weird but it worked. We also ordered #4 which was another meat option with arugula and lots of mozzarella as well. You can't really go wrong with a NY pizza but this place was home run. It was little more upscale than you average NY pizza joint at about $30/pie. Worth every penny!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I love pizza. I eat pizza a lot. I've eaten a lot of pizza in different styles but Juliana's is the best I've had hands down. It was extremely busy but they were efficient and the waiters attentive. We had amazing pizza, great service and will definitely be back as soon as we find ourselves in Brooklyn again. I just wish I had taken a picture but I was honestly just too busy eating the deliciousness to think of it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"We waited 30-45 minutes in the Snow for this very popular place. We ordered a custom half and half margherita. They have their classic pizzas, which you can add a max of two toppings to, and their specialty pizzas which accept no modifications. The wait was a bit difficult, but there was a party of 50 before us. The staff was friendly and did their best to move things along and get us to our table.

The pizza tasted coal-fired, but it was not evenly crispy. It was good, yet not the best I had in NYC. I would recommend adding more flavors to their menu or even maybe a build-your-own option. We also had an IPA from their beer menu, which was decent, and a Chianti, which was very good. Also, some kind of covering for people having to wait in the rain or snow would be helpful.

All in all, this is a very popular place, I would allow yourself time for the line and getting in, and check out their menu ahead of time. If you're a pizza fan, you owe it to yourself to try different pizza shops in NYC and see which ones you like the most.  That said, the table next to us was having a large and impressive looking calzone,  I would try that if you're hungry.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Have been waiting to come to Juliana's and finally had a free weekend and made it happen. As most know, this is a famous spot in NY (for the pizza people at least). Funny to see the pizza ""war"" in person with lines from Juliana's and Grimaldi's running into one another.

We probably waited about 35-40 minutes to sit down, which personally was not too bad. You just need to make sure you are in before 3:15 (if it is around that time) as they stoke the fire I think from 3:15-4 so will not be seating people in between that time.

The pizza was great. Thin & crispy as I love it, with great sauce and cheese ratio. We ordered the meatballs for an appetizer which were pretty good and then a pepperoni pie with half ricotta. Truly enjoyed it and would recommend. Worth the hype.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Pizzas were always have been a great deal  for me, especially, when you are dying from a midnight hunger. I wouldn't elaborate much, but I feel spilling out some heavy beans on their delicious pizzas would justify my mid night cravings. The best is their Margherita! oh damn! It was heavens. The base of absolutely spongy, you know, like the cheesiest it can get. Their toppings...just wow... tomatoes and pepperoni! I wonder where do they get it. It was nicely diced and presented which made my hunger go wild! I definitely recommend.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Pure perfection. The best pizza there is. Simple, fresh ingredients, coal fired brick pizza. Patsy Grimaldi is the pizza master of New York. A Brooklyn staple.

The lineage of this place goes back decades via different business names but this is the spot you should visit.  The quality of the pizza is superb.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Delicious pizza. Fresh ingredients. Nice waiter. Fast service.  Good experience.

Juliana's Pizza,Hands down some of the best pizza I've had. My friends and I stopped in for a quick snack after walking around in Brooklyn and shared a medium Margherita pizza. The ingredients were so fresh and the mozzarella was excellent! Definitely would love to come back when in Brooklyn :) The staff was extremely friendly and service was great too. We came by on a Thursday late afternoon (4 PM) and there wasn't a wait for a table but it the restaurant was also semi-full. People just seem to enjoy good pizza at Juliana's at all times of the day!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Been there before the corona outbreak started...long queue to be seated. It is located just next to the Grimaldi' Pizzeria and walking distance to the Pier. During a good weather day, I will prefer to sit outside than inside. After all the hype, I tried the margarita and white half/half and a large No.6. Honestly the craze is due to the simplicity. Simple and fresh ingredients that is what it is. You don't feel uncomfortable after eating a meal. The pizza crust is amazing not like the local pizza stores. For me quality fresh ingredients, simplicity is the key to Juliana's. Honestly it is just a pizza but it is about 3-4 times the price of a normal dominos or papa johns. This, it is not affordable for everyday meal but the price is probably due to the brand value and quality simple ingredients.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Great place. We love coal fired pizza and this place is a gem. Came here after watching sunset at DUMBO, which was dinner time. The wait outside surprisingly wasn't bad as the line moved fairly quickly. When we got in line we were about 20 people and 5 groups back, but were seated in less than 30 minutes. Service on the inside was great as well. Timely and attentive as well as fun.

We have been to other coal fire pizza place right around the corner and learned of the interesting connection between the two. Having eaten at both I prefer this one. It has more of a local feel to it than the other place, as well as top notch service and great pizza.

Pizzas come in two sizes and both are cut into 8 slices. Our group of three found the smaller size plenty big enough. We ordered the margarita pizza and added Kalamata olives and pepperoni. It was a great choice. Pizza came hot and fresh with the characteristic light char on the bottom of a coal fired pizza. It was delicious.

We washed it down with some egg creams. They also were really good. Can't go wrong with either but I think I enjoyed the vanilla one a little better.

Rounded out our meal with a slice of NY cheesecake drizzled with raspberry sauce.

Great service, pizza, drinks, and dessert made for a great meal. We will be back next time we're in Brooklyn.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Really delicious pizza. Took a subway over to Brooklyn from Manhattan, and grabbed a delicious pizza and meatballs at this place. Short line waiting outside to get in, tight tables, but that didn't bother us.
Service was friendly, ambience was nice! Food was delicious.
Bummed that we couldn't get the brookie bridge, they were out of vanilla ice cream. The black cherry ice cream was so amazing. Took the ferry back to Manhattan, which was great and super fast!
I'd definitely go here again.
Bathroom line can get a bit long. Go before you ""have"" to go!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I don't always come to NYC, but when I do i eat at Juliana's

Huge fan of Grimaldi's and wood fired pizzas, but Juliana's is the place I compare all pizza's to. I came here 4 years ago and it hasn't changed one bit. Food and service were outstanding.

We ordered the Arugula Salad(with goat cheese and walnuts) to start, refreshing and delicious.
We ordered a large arugula and prosciutto pizza (#4 I believe), sooooooooo good!

And we topped off the night with two Brookie Bridges, one with vanilla the other with raspberry ice cream. Holy moly...

We left stuffed and satisfied.

Until next time!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Juliana's Pizza,"I'm in NY for the first time and multiple people have recommended that I go to Juliana's for their pizza. I got to the restaurant just before 6pm, so there was no line up yet. The line started to form up outside as I was eating, so I was glad I arrived early.

I thought the pizza was good, but it wasn't the best that I've had. It could be because I prefer Neapolitan pizzas with a doughier crust. I liked how the pizza at Juliana's was thin so I wasn't super full after sharing the medium pizza with a friend. It's worth a try, but there might be others around the city that are less touristy.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Braving the cold December weather, I brought in my visiting friends to this Juliana's to satify their curiosity over New York pizza. We ordered pizza #1*, pizza #6*  and pasta with meatballs. I especially enjoyed pizza #1 its a bit salty because of the pancetta but then that is how it is supposed to be. The guacamole on pizza #6 sealed the deal. Meatballs were good but not that great, but overall everyone was satisfied!

*no tomato",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Juliana's Pizza,"Ordered the Margherita pizza with added pepperoni and it's definitely one of the better pizzas I've eaten. Star of the pizza really had to be the crust, which is perhaps the best pizza crust I've ever had-- perfect crunchiness and thickness. All the ingredients tasted fresh and the pepperoni was really good. I'd get there 15 min before opening, since the place fills up really fast and people line up outside before it opens. All in all, if you're a fan of pizza, I'd say it's more than worth a visit.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I thought this was pretty average pizza for New York - especially for Brooklyn. Given the high ratings on Yelp, I was definitely a bit underwhelmed. It almost feels like this place has been overhyped by tourists.

My girlfriend and I ordered the margherita pizza to share. The flavor was not bad, but I had to add some salt and red pepper. The dough was also chewier than what I usually prefer.

We also ordered their cannoli for dessert which I also was not a fan of. It tasted more artificial than I would have liked.

My girlfriend on the other hand really likes this place though so I will probably give it another try. For some reason this just didn't hit the spot for me.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"The No. 1 Pizza was a thin crust white pizza with bacon, smoked cheese, mozzarella, and olive oil. The Italian bacon on it was absolutely delicious. The large size was perfect for 3 people - no leftovers and everybody's bellies satisfied!

We were lucky enough to get seated around 4:30pm on a Friday without any wait time - there was an open table right by the door! However, by the time we left, well into dinner time, there was a sizable line of people waiting outside.

The pizza was really good but not out of this world (a little too much oil for my taste) and the dessert was alright. Maybe if we had gotten one of the more special sweet treats, like the cannoli or ring ding dessert, we would have been more impressed. Additionally, the restaurant is pretty crowded when it comes to indoor seating, which is pretty normal!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Love how the pepperoni curls up. Just the right amount of toppings for the pizza to come sizzling hot to the table. Excellent salad and superior dressing. Nice open kitchen concept allows you to watch the Pizza preparation show. Busy place. You wait outside for a table. Heat lamps and a canopy make the wait acceptable. Restrooms inside.

Stopped by today at 4pm when the restaurant wasn't even half full to drop $30+ dollars and then some on a pie to go. Couldn't be easier profit right?

Instead, the hostess tells me it'll be more than a half hour wait to somehow make a pizza that takes a single minute to bake. I should also note to management that she also doesn't tell me about the Time Out market outpost as an alternative. Pity because they do make the best pizzas.

Luckily, we were seated at the bar immediately. We came in for an early lunch, but at around noon there was a line forming out the door. The service was fantastic and attentive. Waters were constantly refilled and our friendly server showed us that small was actually large enough to feed two people. We ordered the margherita pizza topped with extra toppings (prosciutto and garlic) for an additional cost. Pizza was prepared fresh in front of our faces to our table and into our tummies.

Juliana's Pizza,"Delicious brooklyn pizza! Busy almost any time of the day it seems. There was a line even at 2:30 on a weekday. Worth the wait, it moves quickly!

Freshly made to order pizza. Pies only!

No. 1 - the truffles called us and Margherita. They have two sizes and the three of us split the medium. We were stuffed! The pizza was delicious - thin crust without being too chewy. It was not too salty as well after the pizza cooled down a bit. Ample toppings and cheese. The truffle in the No. 1 came out very nicely. Probably can't choose a favorite between the two - one is a restaurant special and the other is a classic well done.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

And definitely don't be scared of sitting at the counter, where you'll get to watch them make the pizzas!

It may seem weird to order a salad at a place where pizza is the reason for coming, but do yourself a favor and get the the caesar salad WITH the olives and anchovies added on.  Best salad I have ever had.

The pizza... wow. Can't go wrong. One of my faves in NYC.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Make sure to say specifically you would like to sit at one of the 2 tables outside or else you will be kicked out. Tried that but because we already had it ordered from takeout my friend and I were rudely told to eat somewhere else. Even though the waiter cleaned the table in front of us as we were hovering over it. Embarrassing, maybe? The pizza made up for horrible communication.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Juliana's Pizza,"BEST WHITE PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!

Enough said.

However, the Margherita was not as good as I was expecting, but maybe my expectations were too high... Definitely worth the hype though, and would gladly come back here over and over again.

We came on a chillier late Fall weekday night, and there was plenty of seating. The ambience is on the casual side, but the credit card option is a plus compared to next door at Grimaldis.

My boyfriend and I came here for the first time together, but he thinks the Margherita next door was ever so slightly better.... oh, how the debate never ends. To each their own!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"YUM is the only thing that comes to mind when talking about Juliana's. After a long day hanging out in DUMBO, I wanted something light and satisfying. Although the wait time was about an hr long it was well worth it. The menu was full of creative options but I kept it simple with cheese, sausage, and pepperoni. The crust was thin but not floppy, the cheese had a nice pull to it, they were generous with the toppings, and most importantly, the pizza wasn't greasy.

I loved that they use a brick oven to make their pizzas, you rarely see that these days and it definitely played a part in why our pies came out within minutes.

The restaurant is small and they really pack you in there. Unless you got a table for two against the wall, you were sharing a table with strangers. Luckily were seated right before they closed to prep for the afternoon rush so it was only a tight squeeze for a little bit. Other than the wait time to get into this place, it was amazing.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Simply the best pizza of our whole trip throughout the northeast. Service was friendly and quick!

Juliana's Pizza,"Deserving of solid three stars and is worth checking out if you're in the area. I don't really like pizza but I finished four slices of the margherita pizza. We ordered the white pizza & margherita pizza combo but I wasn't a big fan of the white pizza.
We showed up around 9pm on a Sunday night and ended up waiting in line for about 30 mins. I hardly ever wait in line for food. Like ever. If I stand in line to eat, it better be fking amazing and I honestly wasn't dying for it, hence the 3 stars. Service was good, casual vibe, and I was surprised that people kept on walking in to eat after 9:50 despite the restaurant closing at 10pm.

Worth checking out. I wouldn't wait longer than 30 mins",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Always go to the long line and the long wait restaurants, so you know it's the best one in town, like this one! We arrived when the line wasn't that long but long enough to wait for 25-30 mins. There's no turning back. Must try this! Said I!

After getting a table, it was quite the best one too, table for two not far back but right next to the host near the entrance. This is good because not a lot of traffic here. We decided to get a Caesar Salad with anchovies and then we picked a large size #4 pizza with arugula and prosciutto. It was also recommended by our young waiter, Anthuro. He's the best, very respectful and knew what he's doing. The anchovies was the white anchovies and this was good because of all the anchovies we have tried in our lives, the white anchovies makes perfect Caesar salad. It comes with olive too woohoo! After that, we received our huge pizza. It's huge! No kidding! There's another one I'm not kidding, which is... we finished everything in one night. No leftover! Sorry pizza box and paper bag, there's no job for you tonight! We loved it so much and we're feeding the poor, us! Of course we had some desserts too! Cheesecake and Brooklyn Seltzer! Amazing!

Since we enjoyed this restaurant, we thought about coming back soon. We came back after two days and had it to go! No kidding! This time we had a margarita pizza and it was fantastic! I urge everybody to try at least once and combine this with your sightseeing.

Juliana's Pizza,"Definitely the best pizza I've ever had. ( No I am not exaggerating). Really the best. The quality of the dough and ingredients are unbeatable, and it is such a classic and delicious NY style pizza. It's not too heavy since the ingredients are fresh, service was good as well and our food came out hot and fresh.

I got two large pizzas to share. The first one I got just Margherita which was so delicious and classic. Less is more sometimes, and this pizza is delicious. I could've eaten a while one myself despite how huge it was.

The second pizza's toppings were Meatball and Ricotta. This was great also, while the Margherita is my favorite, this is definitely my second . Such a delicious combo that compliments each other. I highly recommend

Overall Julianna's is the best pizza I've had, and the best in New York IMO. The crust/dough is amazing & the ingredients and flavors are fresh and delicious.You have to come by when you are in the area, split two large pizza with your friends and thank me later.

I can eat this Margherita pizza all day. If you like thin crust pizza, this is a must try. The pizza is oven baked and is super duper fresh. 

When I took my first bite, I was in disbelief. It was super fresh and the crust was very crunchy! However, if you do not eat the pizza when it's fresh out of the oven, it does taste a little underwhelming. Would highly recommend getting the pizza fresh and eating it then and there!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I was skeptical when I saw the line outside despite the cold. I decided it was worth it giving a try. We waited for about 20 minutes - the line moves pretty fast. We ordered a classic cheese pie and a pepperoni. It is solid pizza. We had a bottle of wine with our pizza and it was overall a very enjoyable experience. I didn't feel rushed and the service was very attentive. We were lucky enough to sit right by the pizza oven, so we got dinner and a show. We also had a chance to talk to the owner, a very sweet guy. I would definitely recommend coming here, as I prefer Juliana's over the neighbor.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Listen, Linda. This was my first pizza in New York. I didn't know what to expect because I do not like thin crust, nor do I like margarita pizzas. I say margarita because it's one of their most popular. We waited for over an hour for this as well. It was super hot outside that day. There is a good amount of seating, but still a small little place. There is also open kitchen so that takes up some space as well. But when you get inside.. it's like a whole different universe. It's like you can't remember waiting in the line. The people making pizzas are quick and they get ready quick as well. I waited for the bathroom in a line and just watched. They whipped like 10 margarita pizzas, so that made me determined to get it since so many people were ordering it. When it came out and I took a first bite. I was in disbelief. I had no idea that the 2 things I don't like for in a pizza just blew me away. You can absolutely taste the freshness to the ingredients as well, which I think played a huge role.

You can also do half and half. But you can't choose a specialty pizza for it. They are the create your own pizzas mostly.

Highly, recommend the spot. Margarita pizza all the way!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Great service, great pizza and amazing cheesecake!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Excellent coal fire pizza in the heart of Dumbo. Some things to know. There is always a line. Expect at least an hour, probably more depending on day, season and weather. They close 3:15 to 4:00 to clean the ovens so if you get on line at 2:30 you are in for a long wait. There are other things on the menu besides pizza but nothing worth waiting in line for. They have a few interesting beers for your beverage enjoyment. And don't fall for the offers to get off the line for immediate pizza at Ignazios around the block unless you have a screaming child or are about to pass out from heat or cold. This isn't a regular trip but a worthwhile experience and pilgrimage for the pizza lover.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I enjoyed my late evening dinner at Juliana's. My fiancé and I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni. The pizza was extremely fresh and cooked to perfection - the freshest mozzarella! We also got a glass of Pinot Grigio which was a nice taste. I would definitely come here again. This time around the line was reasonable and the wait was tolerable. Inside can be cramped. But we lucked out that after ordering the offered us another spot where we weren't in the middle. The service was great, quick and attentive. Look forward to visiting again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Came here half an hr before the restaurant opened to line up and there were already people ahead of us. We got in with no problem and had the prosciutto arugula pizza and it was delicious! However, I'm not sure I would line up for this again, next time maybe takeout is a better idea.

No complaints on service and the pizza came out pretty fast. Would recommend if never been here to give it a shot; worth the try at least.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"When in New York, pizza is a MUST, particularly at Juliana's. Long story short, this is Mr. Grimaldi's new pizza restaurant. I had pizza at a few different places during my visit to New York City, and I can say the best pizza I had was from here. Although this isn't your new age kind of unique pizza place with atypical pizza ingredients, they make great traditional pizza.
Pricing
Pretty standard from places that I went to around NYC. My fiancé and I got a medium margherita pizza for $21, but it only costs $3 more for a large at $24. If you have a big enough party, I would definitely agree that getting a large for $3 is so worth the price. Additional toppings to your pizza vary from $2-$6 depending on what you want.
Food
Amazing. I was most certainly not disappointed. They make their margherita pizzas similar to how other people would with the tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil, and olive oil, but something about their pizza was different than everyone else's. They definitely added more fresh mozzarella than some other places, which I really appreciated. The crust was very crispy, the cheese melted amazingly into the pizza, and their olive oil drizzle  was the equivalent to a cherry on top of the sundae.
Service
Service was great. Mr. Grimladi was working when I went with my fiancé, and he made the effort to talk with us and asked if we needed anything.
Overall
Great pizza, and great experience. I would say this should be near the top of your pizza adventures if you are going to NYC, you won't be disappointed!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"We arrived on a random Saturday afternoon at 1:40pm to a line out the door. The line was almost to Grimaldi's next door.

My party of 3 basically got in line and started looking at other pizza joints to check out within walking distance that didn't have such long lines as these spots...

Well we had a 20 minute wait and were seated at the bar. FYI, if given the option to sit at the bar, say yes. You get to watch them make all the pizzas and oversee all the action. It was great!

As for the pizza itself... We ordered the small margherita pizza with half pepperoni on it, and it was delicious. The crust wasn't too thin but not super thick. Everything was perfectly cooked. Not greasy. Great size for us 3 girls - about 2.5 slices each.

Note that this place closes at 3 so the kitchen staff can clean the oven.

If you come to Brooklyn, make sure you stop by. I have bookmarked this spot so I can come back every visit!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Before beginning our full day of fun and exploration, my friend and I ordered a small margherita pizza topped with pepperoni. Nothing makes me happier than lifting a slice off the pan and seeing the cheese stretch like there's no tomorrow. Each bite of that thin crust pizza with marinara, mozzarella, and basil was delicious. One small pizza is the perfect amount for 2 people.

There are three classic pizzas: margherita, marinara, and white. You can then build upon these pizzas with any toppings that you desire. These toppings come at an additional price. There are pizza specials with toppings already picked; you cannot make changes to these ones.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"This is very good pizza, but it is way overpriced and I can't believe this section of Brooklyn now... this whole area ... It is a tourist trap :) !

I had the margarita pizza. Very good, really... much better than many pizzas I've had. The Waiter was cool, the pizza was provided fast, and I would say this is a super profitable business.

For all the tourists, or any pizza snob like me, on your way back to JFK, and after you have had this pizza, try New Park Pizza on Cross Bay Blvd before you catch your flight.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,Came here on an extremely busy Saturday afternoon. The wait was too long that we called in a pickup order which would be ready in 2 hours. We went to Brooklyn Bridge park while we waited for our pickup time. We got a small (15 inches) half margherita and half pepperoni. Pizza was baked in a coal oven and it was amazing! Hot and fresh. Must try!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"We just left St Ann's Warehouse and I was craving good pizza. Thought about Grimaldis but saw that Juliana's had much better reviews. Well, ended up being disappointment after disappointment:

1. A dozen beers on tap and not a single dark one (Id be ok with either black or red or brown). Nada.
2. Toppings: well options are not mind blowing to start with. However asked for extra mozzarella, mushrooms and garlic and... were told that we can only get 2 max! WTF?! It's not like they're free!?
3. Mushrooms were both tasteless and hard to find on the pie if you know what I mean.
4. Mozzarella was cheeeeeeewy. If I knew would have paid extra to remove it not to get extra.
5. But the punchline was the grass supposed have been basil I think. It gave me nothing but annoying strings stuck in most of my teeth.

Did add an extra star for friendly staff...",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"One of the best pizza experiences of my life.  Waiting outside for an hour wasn't ideal but worth the wait for a table in this fantastic pizza spot.  Was seated in a corner table in the back near the kitchen.  Ordered two medium pizzas to split between three: one margherita and one white pizza.  Both were fabulous.  We didn't think we would have room to pack down both pizzas but somehow found the room for these wonderful pies.  We ordered a Brookie Bridge to share for dessert and was not let down in the sweets department either.  Staff was great and even the owner was walking around lending a hand, and stopped to chat with us for a few minutes. Also, although not requested we got a birthday celebration from the staff for my wife which made the night all that much better.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Atmosphere: Cute and small interior with limited seating. We coincidentally got to Juliana's right before they opened, and there was already a small line outside the restaurant. We hopped in line and were seated in the first round of people.

Service: Friendly service! We received our food pretty quickly considering that the restaurant was full.

Food: We ordered a small Margherita pizza, and it was the perfect size to share for two. The crust had a delicious crunch to it, and the sauce was flavorful. The cheese was a bit too chewy at times, but otherwise, we had a great pizza!

Overall: Pretty solid pizza place. Juliana's is a bit on the pricier side for a pizza, but we'd say that it lives up to the hype. If you can beat the wait, definitely stop by Juliana's.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Checked out Juliana's for the first time today for lunch (Tuesday, April 2). I was bracing myself for a lengthy line but there was no wait when we got there around 12:15 p.m. By the time we were finished with our meal, a decent line had formed outside the restaurant. We found parking in an underground garage on Furman Streer near the Squibb Park bridge.

I was informed that our stroller had to be parked outside by the front door. Ours is a super compact fold so I merely folded it up and set it beside us against the wall. Just a heads up for those traveling with large strollers. High chair was a sturdy plastic one that kept my 13 month old from pulling in his legs and twisting around in his seat.

The menu is straightforward. We ordered the Margherita pizza with pepperoni and ricotta. I felt like the large was big enough for our group (3 adults - 2 women, 1 man) to be satisfied. We also ordered the spaghetti alla puttanesca for my 13 month old. No kid sized servings available. Flavors were simple yet fresh and delicious. The meatballs do have cheese in them so they're not dairy free friendly.

There's one restroom and no changing table. Service was good. I'd imagine that you could simply grab an order and enjoy it in Brooklyn Bridge Park when the weather is warm. I'd come again!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,Best pizza in NYC period !!! The Margherita pie is awesome . I have been going to this place for years and they never disappoint. A must try if you are visiting brooklyn for authentic pizza by the pie,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Tis pretty effing delicious.

Waited in line starting at 3:35pm on a Saturday for their 4pm opening and was only the third party in line. We were seated immediately when they reopened and ordered a half Margherita half White with Mushrooms & Sausage pizza. The Margherita was good but the White w/ M&S side was divine! I liked how there wasn't too much crust...the white sauce had the perfect amt of garlickyness, and the shiitake mushrooms added a nice touch.

With the gazillion pizza options in NYC, this is def one of the best ones, and I would not mind lining up  again to try this.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Really enjoy the pizza here. Ignore all the feuding, this place is a little better than Grimaldi's, but they're both pretty good. Yeah it's touristy, and sometimes if the line is long I just eat at shake shack rather than wait in that line, but the food here is good and they move fast. The space is a little tight, so if you want more room Grimaldi's has room to stretch out.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"These pizzas are insanely good (read: fresh mozzarella, tangy and slightly sweet tomato sauce, crispy roasted crust that's just thin enough). It's also a plus that it doesn't take too long to wait and eat. Ladies- there are under seat hooks for your bags!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Usually there is a huge line here and that's pretty obvious from the queue marker outside the restaurant. The servers are very aware that the tables are uneven and make sure there is support underneath constantly so the tables don't wobble.

My opinion is that a margherita pizza is the one pizza that you can easily compare apples to apples for pizza places.
I loved the cheese they used. It melted nicely and mixed with the sauce and basil, unlike other places that still have kind of a ""cake"" of mozzarella cheese and it doesn't spread much.

We got a large and the two of us still ate it all :)
Only downside was that it got cold really, really quickly. Like our second slice was already cold.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Totally worth the wait,  which really wasn't bad.  White pizza is amazing! The meatballs were the best!  Tried my first egg cream",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I usually come take my friends here who are visiting after walking the Brooklyn Bridge. Although I wouldn't say this is the best in Brooklyn, it's a solid choice and still delicious without having to trek 30+ minutes. There's usually a line around 6pm so try to avoid the dinner rush! I truly enjoy the service of the place and I believe I've seen the owner chilling and talking to customers. I usually do a basic pizza and add on maybe 1-2 toppings. It's great. Nice crust with a bit of a crunch, fresh cheese, and great flavor from the tomato sauce but still subtle. I enjoy this place over others in the area and it's such a short walk from the bridge or the park in dumbo! I highly recommend for anyone visiting or craving a pizza.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Do I dare to say, best pizza in New York?! YES!!!

When you have to wait in line outside the restaurant to get a seat, you already know this must be the spot. I had read about Juliana's prior to visiting Brooklyn and am so glad I did...this place is amazing!

We arrived about 10 minutes before the restaurant ""closes"" for 30 minutes for lunch and got in the fairly long line outside. Within a few minutes we were greeted by the owner (maybe manager) of the place ad assured he would be able to get us all in before they close. After about 15 minutes of anticipation we were seated in the cute restaurant with the delicious smell of coal fired pizza filling the air. Our server greeted us promptly and quickly returned with 2 ice cold beers, we ordered a large margarita pizza and within about 5 minutes it came to the table. As a self proclaimed pizza snob I take my pizza pretty seriously and this pizza did not dissapoint! It was perfectly crispy on the base, the thinnest crust I think I have ever had and the perfect mix of fresh mozzarella, delicious tomato sauce and basil.

Between the two of us we devoured the whole pizza and left happy and extremely full. We will definitely return when we go back to Brooklyn!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"When you talk pizza, Juliana's is synonymous with perfection in terms of quality and customer service.

When we arrived from a beautiful boat ride over the Hudson, we were immediately greeted and seat.

Our server was magnificent but most importantly informative of the menu and beer.

We ordered Peronis to begin the night and this was the best beer I have had in the longest.
Smooth and crisp with a beautiful glass to compliment.

We ordered the large margarita with half pepperoni and half sausage and meatball pizza.

The pizza was thin, crispy, and made to perfection. The meatball melted with each bite, the sausage had bits of fennel and the pepperoni was phenomenal.

We finished our night with a canoli and cheesecake which completed our dinner. The canoli was filled with stuffing and crunched with each bite. The cheesecake was fantastic with the strawberry glaze that was drizzled upon it.

Overall, this is a must stop when finding the best pizza of Brooklyn.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,We got the tomato mozzarella pepperoni pizza here and the pizza was slightly smoky and so delicious. It's a little pricey but can be split between two people. It is amazing New York pizza and worth the wait!! It also accepts credit card unlike Grimaldi's next door.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Juliana's Pizza,"I was visiting NY a few weeks ago and was determined to get my hands on some pizza in Brooklyn. A subway ride and a walk in the rain later, my husband and I finally made it to Juliana's Pizza. We came on a Friday night around 8pm and the line was out the door... and for good reason! The service, the pizza, the dessert were ALL absolutely amazing!

Our server was the sweetest old Italian man. He quickly took our order and made some great suggestions. We ended up getting a small Margherita Pizza to share between the two of us, and it was more than plenty of food. The pizza itself was pretty thin and not as doughy as I expected. Nevertheless, it was delicious! The flavoring was all there! After our meal, our server talked us into getting the Egg Cream dessert, which to me was like a chocolate soda. DELICIOUS!

What a great experience! I'll be telling stories about my mission to get pizza in Brooklyn again and again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"This was one of the worst pizzas I've ever had.  We went for lunch to try to celebrate a birthday.  Unfortunately, Juliana's was the biggest disappointment of our trip.  Overall terrible pizza and service.

First we waiter 40 minutes in the rain, which would have been fine if the pizza was worth it.  We ordered a number 2, but we got a number 1 instead.  We tried to get the attention of our waitress, but she didn't check on us once.  She brought our drinks and then our check, and nothing else.  Compared to every other restaurant in the city, servers usually check on you 3-4 times, I don't expect this, but at least check up on us once and make sure our food is alright.  I wasn't a fan of the wine, we were cold, tired and hungry so we just decided to eat the nasty pizza and get out of there.

The Number one was disgusting and practically inedible.  It was like salty cheese bread.  Not only was it gross and the server didn't even attempt to fix this error, but we waited for so long and the pizza was pretty expensive.  I can't say anything nice about this pizza.  I'm sure other choices are good and the ambiance is nice, but the number 1 was disgusting.  Extremely disappointed by this experience.

If you want good pizza in Brooklyn go to Luccali, di Fara (original location), Joe's or Best pizza.  All of these places are far better than Juliana's.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,One of the best pizzas I've had.  Pizza was thin had great texture and was fresh and tangy at the same time.

Juliana's Pizza,"Best pizza I've had anywhere ever!
When the place we intended to go to next door was closed for renovations we ended up here. I'm so glad we did because the pizza was nothing short of spectacular. We waited quite a while to get in but it was 100% worth it! Ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. Thank you, next.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Awesome NY style pizza by none other than Patsy Grimaldi! My husband have wanted to visit this pizzeria for a very long time now (frankly, ever since he was disappointed by a visit to Lombardi's) and we got our chance when my aunt and uncle were visiting town. After a visit to One World Observatory we crossed over to Brooklyn and my husband queued up while I took my aunt and uncle to the Brooklyn Bridge. By the time we were finished we were near the front of the line.

We ordered two different pies, one a white pizza with pancetta and the other a tomato sauce with sausage. Both were excellent! Definitely what I would recommend if you're after a NY style slice! Would come back again for sure!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Really cute place. Waited about 15 minutes with my fiancé on a Friday night. The tables are really close together, so our table of two was literally 2 inches from being a table of 4. No big deal on that though, but I wouldn't recommend for a quiet dinner. The pizza was really good. We really liked the sauce and crust. The service by Mitchell was horrible though. After taking our order, he didn't stop at our table a single time after passing by no less than 6 times. We wanted crushed red pepper but no Mitchell. We wanted another beer and drink but no Mitchell. We had to flag him down for a check. It's good, but in a pizza city, we'll go somewhere else next time.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"After a long walk down the brooklyn bridge and strolling around the DUMBO on a sweltering hot summer day we were looking for a place to grab a quick bite. Then we see Juliana's with a long line and people swarming the block waiting for their turn. With all the rave reviews it has got we decide to go & line up. After a long 1 hour of wait, the moment of truth finally arrived. Our opportunity to experience one of the best pizza's in the DUMBO.

We ordered the large Margherita Pizza with sweet onions, mushrooms, roasted peppers and the large white pizza with olives, mushrooms and roasted peppers. You'd think we'd be tough to please after waiting so long in the hot sun and then waiting some more for pizza to arrive. But we fell in love the moment cheese hit our palette. The sauce is KING! I thought the cheese would be overpowering on the white pizza considering there is no tomato sauce but it was just the right amount. The margherita pizza had the right amounts of basil and tomato giving that sweet but savory taste.

A must in DUMBO. Definitely worth dedicating a day for.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Juliana's is absolutely amazing.  Among the top brick oven pizzas I've had and that's saying a lot!  The crust was perfectly baked, thin and chewy.

Juliana's Pizza,"Very good pizza, line was long, there was a long wait, crammed seating.. The dough was thin and chewy in some areas, and took a very long time to get the food and drinks.

Juliana's Pizza,"Was at Juliana's pizza on a Sunday. The place is usually considered a competitor of Grimaldi's Pizza right next door. Both places had long lines, but a word of mouth around the neighborhood was telling us that Juliana's pizza is way better than Grimaldi's so we decided to give it a shot. It was a party of two and we waiting on line for about 15-20 minutes or so. We sat by the wall on the right hand side as soon as you walk in. We were greeted by the host who was very kind and professional although she was busy taking care of the crowd outside she still managed to keep her professionalism and attention to the customers. A young server helps us taking our order, apparently he was very busy which we understand, they want people in and out. He rushed us to order, so we just ordered meatballs and a medium pie. The meatballs were perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of garlic and parsley in it, a juicy and tender flavorful meatball with a very well made sauce, I decided to cut one and add it to my slice of pizza and I've got to say: PERFECT COMBO.
The pizza was thin crust and was well made. The medium pie comes with 8 slices so we had 4 slices each, they are very thin so won't really fill you up as I thought it was. We asked for parmigiano cheese and the waiter was a little resistant about the request  although we wanted cheese on our pizza he replies :"" are you sure?! This pizza usually doesn't need cheese, the parmigiano ruins it""
We just ignored his opinion and still went for the parmigiano and it was excellent on top of the pizza so we were confused of what he was tried to prove. ‍. Overall we only saw our waiter when we asked for cheese, we had to ask for straws to the buss boy who replies "" I can't, you have to ask your waiter""
For straws?!  strange
So I decided to get up and ask the host who was the only polite staff that we've encountered and she brought us straws in a heart beat.
I definitely recommend this place if you'd like to try their pizza. It's different from others for sure.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"It was very disappointed. They ran out of many food options. It was a Friday and had no food for lunch. I mean Pizza was available but no meatball or chicken. I was confused needless to say.

Pizza and Salad was good but a bit pricy for the selection. I'd probably come again but not anytime soon.

They do not seat you unless every in your party is ready. Nor do that take reservations. We got lucky and sat immediately around lunch time and we had a large group 6 people.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"The pizza at Julianna's in certainly worth the wait.  Being my second visit, I knew that we'd need to wait for a table however we were seated within 20 minutes.

This famous Brooklyn pizza institution is popular for good reason. Fresh ingredients, prompt service and the ability to add your own favourites to this famous Brooklyn staple.

We ordered the Margarita with fresh basil.  To this, we added pepperoni, fennel sausage, mushrooms and extra mozerella.  Melt in your mouth perfection, with minimal crust.

A bottle of Napa Valley Cab was the perfect accompaniment to aid digestion.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Juliana's Pizza,"When in Brooklyn, it is a rite of passage to have Juliana's Pizza. You'll be in line 45 minutes or more. You'll wonder if you should go to the other pizza places in DUMBO, but my YE recommendation is to stay in line. This is New York pizza at its finest!

A short New York pizza history lesson. This pizza spot is named after the daughter of Patsy Grimaldi. He's the guy who started Grimaldi's pizza, then sold Grimaldi's to a guy named Frank Ciolli. Then Patsy Grimaldi came out of retirement and started Juliana's Pizza with the original brick-oven recipe he learned from his family. I've been told you'll see him at the front on many days ringing customers up. He wasn't there the day we went.

Juliana's only sells whole pies, no slices. We had the cheese pizza and white cheese pizza. It took about thirty minutes for the pizzas to arrive, but we really didn't mind. We had good conversation and enjoyed the atmosphere!

Once the pizzas arrived...our chatty group was quiet because we were all busy eating!

5 stars kid. Remember, stay in line! We didn't regret it and hopefully you won't either!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

I went there on a Tuesday afternoon and luckily only had to wait about 20 minutes for a seat at the counter (so cool because you get to watch the process!) Both the hostess and my server were extremely attentive and welcoming. Now, for the pizza. I had a medium half classic margherita and half marinara with pepperoni and it was HEAVEN! Both halves were absolutely perfect. The margherita was one of the best (if not THE best) I've ever had and the garlic and pepperoni on the marinara side was just the right amount. Next time, I'll repeat the margherita and also try the white pizza. I'll be drooling until then...",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

We ordered two of the Caesar salads, a spaghetti and meatballs, margherita pizza, marinara pizza and a bottle of wine.

The pasta was perfectly cooked and the pizzas were amazing as well. To top it all off, the waiters brought out a cheesecake with a raspberry syrup to wish me a happy birthday.

All in all, highly recommend if you're in the area and have the time to dine in here. They don't take reservations or do take out, so more the reason to try!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Ok. The pizza. Wow. Just wow. This is some GOOD pizza. I never knew what good pizza could be like until now. Juliana's has deliciously thin pizzas that have the perfect consistency of chewy yet crispy pizza dough and superbly fresh ingredients. Each ingredient can be tasted as noticeably high quality. I was able to scarf down half a large pizza without blinking. A beautifully made pizza, one I'd recommend for all to try.

Highly recommended, I will definitely be coming back another time.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Now this is pizza. Delicious, hot, did I mention delicious. Juliana's has excellent service and as a solo diner, it was a really lovely experience. This is hands down, the best pizza in NY. Do yourself a favor and head to Juliana's.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"I was there this past November! Amazing! My usual place to go Is next door  to Grimaldis, however after reading a bit of history on Grimaldis and discovering that the original owners sold Grimaldis but then decided to open again and name it Juliana's, I thought if my favorite pizza place of all time to go to when I'm in NYC is Grimaldis and the original owners opened Julianas, well it has to be just as good or better? So I went for it, boy was I not disappointed!!! Just as good, if not better then Grimaldis!!! I was pleasantly surprised and completely satisfied!!! I took my girlfriend who was in pizza heavenn! She made a bold statement as she took many bites of our pizza, "" the best pizza I've ever had""!!! She doesn't say that about anything often, so her taste buds were won with every tasty bite!!! We went in the afternoon on a Friday, there was no waiting! As we sat, it started to get crowded. Our new favorite place when visiting NYC for sure! I wish they had one in Miami!! We'd be there at least 2-3 times a week!!! For those Grimaldi lovers, give Julianas a try..... and ohhhh they take major credit cards, no need to pay high rates on an atm any more because of the ""cash only"" at certain pizza places!! Enjoy, you'll be pleasantly surprised!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"If you're looking for great pizza, look no further. This place is delightful and the venue is ideal. I ordered a pepperoni pie and an order of meatballs and it was delicious. Although they have many other great options, I kept it simple. Loved it and will definitely return soon.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"This was my first visit to Juliana's. It was 11:20am on a Friday when I got on line to get in. Grimaldi's had their own line as well. I got in quickly and ordered a medium Margarita pizza also, quickly, as to not get stuck behind everyone else's orders. I enjoyed my meal at the counter while listening to slow rock tunes and looking back to see the full room on occasion. It's hard to compare pizzas of the same style but I would give the edge to Grimaldi's. If Juliana's should have a shorter line on any given day then I would come here since there's not much difference in taste. An advantage that Juliana's has is the Vanilla Egg Cream. I've never had one before. It tasted unique but in a good way. It can be a little expensive to get at both places. There was an even longer line at the time when I left.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Food incredible as always! Pizza is always 10/10!
Trimell C was a great server. So attentive and kind. Absolutely coming back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Amazing pizza, made fresh to order and you can even grab a seat at the bar to watch it all in action. Our waiter was an older gentleman and he was the sweetest, took our order, made sure everything was good and even recommended dessert which was delicious.

The only reason i gave the place 4 stars and not 5 is because when the cooks are making the pizza, they are not careful with cross contamination of using the same hands for raw meats and veggies. I understand its faster but they could keep that in mind a little bit. And the same knife was used to cut the pizza. If people are watching it being made, these things matter more than if it was brought out from the kitchen.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"We had a group of 7 and we were seated immediately when it first opened. They won't seat you until everyone has arrived. The place was full by 1150 and the next wave of seating wasn't until an hour later.

Our group split three large pizzas.

Margherita pizza was my favorite. It's just thin, crispy, and fresh. Wish there was more basil.

No. 1 was a white pie. I thought this was good, but probably my least favorite out of the three cause it was just cheesy with a bit of bacon. I personally like Artichoke's more.

No. 4 was a prosciutto arugula pizza. I really enjoyed this pizza as well cause I'm a fan of prosciutto and they didn't seem to skimp on it.

Service here was efficient. The pizzas all came out hot and they were quick to clear the tables when we finished each pie.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Gosh I wish I could have access to this pizza everyday. It's so dang good. We just got the margarita pizza and though that pizza is simple, it packed a huge taste! The crust is just so good too. I  usually am not a crust eater but I found myself still munching on the crust even when I was full. Don't be discouraged if you see a long line out front, they are pretty quick with serving everyone so the turn over doesn't take too terribly long. With that said though, if you have all day to pick a time to eat then I'd try to choose a time that's not a prime time for people to eat so that you find a shorter line.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"NEW YORK PIZZA!

Since we came on a weekday for lunch, the wait was only about 8 minutes. They had cold water and cups outside to make the wait bearable in the heat.

I shared a medium No. 3 Pizza Special (mozzarella, sausage, broccoli rabe and garlic).
To be fair, the pizza wasn't life-changing, but the thin crust, simple toppings, and real cheese made for a filling, delicious lunch. Despite us being so close to the kitchen, our pizza came to us just warm instead of piping hot / fresh which is why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. In terms of portions, the medium was perfect to split between 2 people.

Overall, it was clean inside and service was pleasant. I wouldn't mind coming back again if I was in the area and the wait wasn't more than 20 minutes.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Cold is my kryptonite ... it's makes me grouchy so I was off to a rough start here when we were asked to wait outside in the 22 degree cold.  It was 1:30PM so it wasn't crowded at the time and there was no one waiting inside ....  we eventually made it into the vestibule about 5 minutes later and then we were seated about 10 minutes after that.

Once I had thawed, I was mesmerized by the pizza making.  And the pizza itself was delight in my mouth.  The three of us shared the arugula salad and a large margherita pizza with sausage and pepperoni.  The ingredients were all fresh and delicious.  The hubby LOVES pizza and if this place were closer to home, he'd be 20 lbs heavier.  Service once we were seated was terrific.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Definitely a bit hyped as everyone says you need to try julianas/grimaldis when in NY. I stopped by on a Saturday morning and arrived maybe 15 min before opening and there were already about 8 people in line. By the time they opened, there were enough people in line to fill the restaurant.

We got the margherita pizza and added toppings since the other pizzas didn't come with sauce on it. It was good. Not too crispy and thin and not too thick and doughy. The crust was delicious though.

Spaghetti with meatballs- It was okay, just your average spaghetti with meatballs. Probably a better choice for kids. Also you really can't mess up a dish this simple.

Arugula salad- VERY refreshing. Highly recommend that one if you want to add some veggies to your meal!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,Originally planned to go to Grimaldi's but it was closed for reservations. Upon walking further my girlfriend and I kept smelling this delicious smell and could not tell where it was coming from. We realized it was Juliana's Pizza. Waited about 30-45 minutes to be seated but the service we received was 10/10 wish I could remember our servers name but he always provided us we places to see and things to do while we were visiting Brooklyn. Pizza came out with in 10/15 minutes and will definitely go back.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"It was worth a try to wait for the huge line. I wouldn't wait for a long line but my mom and brother were visiting and they wanted to try here.

We ordered half Margherita and half White pizza.
We added mushroom, onions and extra cheese(definitely a good choice).

It didn't look that special but it was beyond my expectations. So so tasty seriously.
It was the best pizza ever!

The dough was crispy and fresh. The pizza sauce was delicious especially that white pizza!!
It was chilly outside when we came here. So we couldn't take pizza to go.
But next time, I will order to go and enjoy their pizza outside so I don't have to wait for a line.

I will come back!! Highly recommended!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"BEST COAL FIRED PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD!!! Don't be intimidated by the long wait, it is definitely worth it. We got into line around 3:10PM, but they closed at 3:15PM so we waited until it opened at 4PM. We weren't in the front, but we were seated by 4:10PM.

The inside of the restaurant is so cute! It gives an old school feel with the music and photos on the wall.

My boyfriend and I got a large half Margherita, half white pizza (pictured). We finished it all!!! It was delicious! We definitely could've gotten another pizza.

The service was pretty good, given how busy the restaurant was. Overall, we will definitely be coming back when in town!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Waited for around 30 minutes to dine in on a Wednesday morning and I can say it's totally worth the wait. The margherita pizza could easily be among the top three I've ever had. It may seem simplistic but the combination of flavors from the basil, oregano, slightly sweet tomato sauce, and rich mozarella just work so well. I like that the pizza is not salty like most others i've tried. The dough is thin, well-charred, and has a nice crisp at the edges and a slight  yeast-y taste which complements the toppings well. I highly recommend the margherita pizza!

Portion-wise, a large pie could comfortably feed two (7 slicesand only costs $3 more than a medium.

I also got the arugula salad which was good and but perhaps not great. It serves as a refreshing palate cleanser between pizza slices.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Couldn't choose between Juliana's and Grimaldi's, but I chose Juliana's and didn't regret it a single bit. The wait time was out the door, but it went by pretty quickly. Of course, it was packed inside, but the service was still pretty good.

I recommend the margherita pizza! It is a classic! Simple yet delicious taste, not overwhelming in any way.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Great pizza!  I went on a Thursday night and the place had a line. My wife and I looked at the online menu while waiting and ordered right as we were seated. 10 minutes later we had our pizza.

We ordered the margherita with house meatballs, which were really good but overpowered the pie. Most of the menu specialty options seemed to favor white pie, and the cheese definitely seems like the main thrust here.  

The sauce is good, but seemed to take a backseat to the meatballs. I'll give five stars because the choice of meatballs was ours, and the fundamentals of great pizza were all here. These guys also blew me away with the quickness with which we got our meal.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Juliana's Pizza is a notable pizza joint in DUMBO area. They serve quality thin NYC style pizzas. Service is very accommodating and friendly. The venue has a decent amount of seating and it fills up quickly. I came early and didn't need to wait in line, but there was a queue when I left. Great pizza joint if you can beat the line!

Ordered:
Margherita pizza - standard, and well prepared with a good crisp. I hate soggy pizza.
No. 1 - a white pizza (no tomato sauce), comes with bacon and extra cheese and I think olive oil. I normally don't like white pies, but I thought it had a good hearty richness and bacon goodness. The cheese wasn't super overpowering either.
No. 4 - prosciutto arugula pizza. This was my favorite. Great balance of cheese, tomato sauce, and generous amounts of arugula and prosciutto",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"There are lots of ""best pizza in NY"" joints in this city, but this is the place I send friends and locals when they ask for my suggestion. Juliana's has an excellent product and I like that when I go in there I'm often greeted and have been served by Pizza Legend Patsy Grimaldi. The restaurant is clean/bright and food is excellent.

I once saw Patsy grab a pie out of a waiter's hands and bring it back to the kitchen because it didn't meet his exacting standards. He apologized to the guests for the momentary delay with a free appetizer while the kitchen ""made the pizza right"". The pizza looked fine to me and so I don't know if this was just ""dog and pony show"" trickery, but it made me feel like when my pizza showed up it was going to be to the highest of standards.

If you're coming and there is a line you might want to see if you can eat at the bar. If you're coming on a weekend I'd come right around when they open so you don't have to wait at all. I always tell people to over-order and bring the leftovers home.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,The food here is  absolutely amazing!! We ordered the meatballs and a couple of starters but we really went overboard and ordered 3 different pizzas for 5 people. Let's just say it was so good that we ate everything plus we took advantage of the samples being given outside. I have never eaten so much in my life but I regret nothing. If you're ever in the area you have to eat here. You won't regret it.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Juliana's Pizza,"I walked the Brooklyn bridge today, from the financial district. Once exiting, I headed straight for Juliana's. Guys, there was a freaking line at 1pm. Seriously, a crazy line. I was standing in the scorching sun. The good news? It moved fast. Waited only 10 minutes or so. Such a quick line.

I ordered the small margarita pizza. Added sausage and pepperoni to it for an additional $7.

Folks, this pizza is overrated. Out of all the pizzas I had while in Manhattan, this one is the worst. Would I come back? Heck no. Prob will go next door instead, as that pizza joint was poppin too!

Pics are attached. Super thin pizza but super crappy taste too. Ya sucks. The pizza wasn't even piping hot. It was just mediocre warm. Blah!! Can you imagine eating a pizza that doesn't even taste hot?

Oh well that's all. Not worth your time eating here.

Also, there are 2 restrooms - one upstairs and one downstairs.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Lively place.
Try their egg cream.
Don't skip the salad.
Elegant, lightly dressed *fresh* as though freshly picked.
Pizza- not one bite disappoints.
Calzone: enormous, creative, delish.
House Chianti: perfectly chosen.
All in all, I highly recommend.
Juliana's is an event.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Juliana's Pizza,"Almost went next door but at the last minute we decided to ""linner"" here after a long few hours exploring the city and walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.

This is a nice little restaurant, not a by-the-slice kind of place. Of the specialty pizzas on the menu, the #6 looked very intriguing; however daughter wished for a simpler, more traditional pizza so we went with one of the classics. I added roasted peppers on half (Note: they still charged full price for the added topping even though it was just on half.) Something to consider if you're adding or creating your own pizza.

The pizza was really, really good. Not what I consider ""New York"" pizza, but I'm not sure that's the aim of the establishment - it's coal fired pizza.

The place is cozy and super cute. Our food was $30 with tip for a small, so not cheap. But we ate it all and left full and happy.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"On our trip to NYC I wanted to take a trip to Brooklyn to try the famous pizza. When we pulled up via Uber, the line was down the sidewalk. It was in the 30s but I figured it must be good if people were willing to freeze. About half hour into my wait, my fiance pointed out the name of the establishment. It was NOT where I intended to go. But A quick google search taught me it was a competitor so I decided to stay put.

The pizza was perfectly thin, we got half with cheese and half pepperoni. We also ordered beer and I love that the beer is served in it's appropriately marked corresponding brewery glass. It was a nice touch. Service was top notch. I bagged up my leftovers and finished it off hours later. It was still great, even cold. I am so glad the driver made the mistake and we ended up at Julianas! I deducted a star for the inconvenience of the long line and nowhere to stay warm while waiting.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"If you're in Dumbo and want pizza, you must go here! There will inevitably be a line and it will probably take you forty minutes to get through. Honestly, you're pretty much going to have to wait to get into most restaurants anyway so, from that perspective, it's really not a big deal; that's also how you know it's quality. I came tonight, on a Monday, and still had to wait forty minutes and when we left the restaurant at 9pm there was still a line the same length- so you really can't get out of it. There aren't reservations so you know that whoever is ahead of you in line is literally everyone who is ahead of you, which is nice.

Their pizza menu is good; each pizza comes in a small or large size but it's only a $3 difference between sizes, honestly get the small. We ordered two small pizzas among four of us and it was more than enough. The smalls truly look like a standard large pizza. If you share the pizzas it'll be a really cheap meal, if you come by yourself or don't split then the pizzas are kind of expensive. Definitely come here though, you won't regret it!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Was here recently for a team holiday lunch, definitely see why this place is so hyped! Before they even opened, there was a short line outside waiting to get in.

We had 15 people so we ordered quite a few pies with some meatballs and dessert. All the pizza was freshly made and delicious! Margherita pies are my favorite, and this was definitely one of the best I've had. Their cannolis are great too. All the staff was incredibly nice and accommodating for our big group. Wouldn't hesitate to come back here again when I'm back in the area.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"We only had to wait 10 min. to get seated at 11:30 AM on a Sunday. If you are looking for a ""traditional NYC pizza,"" this place is not it. I would recommend Joe's or Gotham's pizza instead. Overall, it really depends on what type of pizza you like. Considering the fact that it was charcoal pizza, it was pretty good. The best thing about Juliana's pizza was their fresh tomato sauce. Their dough was a little salty for my taste. Overall, I would have been majorly disappointed if I had to wait over 30 min.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Juliana's Pizza,"YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT IN A LONG LINE

We tried to get a quick bite at Juliana's but the line was so long we did not end up getting seated due to our schedule. HOWEVER, they came out with a whole fresh pizza as a sample while we waited, and I got to try the most delicious pizza I have ever had. If I had all the time in the world, I would have waited until the end.

I took a star off because the wait system seems inefficient. On a Monday afternoon/evening, a line that we told would take 45 minutes, moved maybe 20% by the time it was 40 minutes. It would also be great to have a to go line if people just wanted a slice or a box to go. The line was so long that it met the line for Grimaldi's next door. A friend of mine who lives in NYC told me that the owner of Juliana's used to be owner of Grimaldi's, but sold it a while back. When he wanted to buy it back, they refused, so he opened a Juliana's. So if you're looking for the original Grimaldi's pizza, it's really, Juliana's.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Great pizza solid 4.5 stars. Thin and crispy and fresh sauce and just the right amount of cheese. Dried Italian herbs may be a hot or miss for some. Worth the long wait but not the best pizza. Sorry.

Salad was quite ordinary and lame. Worth half the price.

Calzone is served without sauce - you have to order the saicenseparate. No big deal - but it is meat based Ragu sauce and we are vegetarian. We asked them to give us whatever sauce they have - pizza sauce for example. They said that they cannot do that and there was no other alternative. Really - no tomatoes sauce at a pizza joint! After a minute of dumb staring, we gave up and ate the calzone sans sauce - a good one btw. Packed the rest.

Time for dessert - cannoli. It was a bit of a let down too - something you get from a store ... hmmm

We say just come for pizza, skip the salad  and have dessert elsewhere as there is plenty to explore around",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants

Juliana's Pizza,"Hands down one of the best Margarita pizzas I've ever had. For the life of me I can't believe that people would choose Grimaldi's over this place, especially when Patsy Grimaldi is greeting and seating people right down the block at Juliana's. Both places have long lines and I would say you will not be disappointed if you stick out the line at Juliana's.

The dining room is nice, and all of the staff we encountered were pleasant, helpful and made us feel like it matters that we were there. (Sometimes when you go to places that are packed there's an air of you're lucky to be here so take what you get)

If you want a taste of New York pizza history I highly recommend Juliana's",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Eating at Juliana's was a great experience. Our waiter/service was top notch and couldn't have been any better.

As someone who cant resist a nice bowl of spaghetti and sauce, I had to start with the spaghetti alla puttenesca. It was simple and absolutely delicious. In fact the next time I go back to Juliana's, i'll most likely end up getting it again.

For entree's I split two small pizza pies with my table of four. We ordered the Margarita pie and the #4 special pie. Perfect amount for four people, and probably some of the most delicious coal fire pizza slices you'll find in Brooklyn. I enjoyed the margarita pizza more than the #4.

Highly recommend this place.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Five stars to the best pizza I have ever had in my life BUT BE AWARE of burnt crust. We ordered Margherita pizza. The first time around we tried the pizza the flavor was on point except that I was tasting the bitter burnt crust of the pizza dough. I told our waiter then the manager came and said I agree with you so they took the original burnt pizza and sent another pizza for our table. The second time around was perfectly cooked. The dough was airy, chewy, and on the thinner side and the tomato sauce was as if it was just picked from the garden, the cheese was not salty and perfectly melted on top of the pizza. Simple yet mouth watering. I still dream of going back for another one of their pizzas. I am pretty upset though about the fact that since this is such a highly rated restaurant many of the customers sitting by our table were eating burnt crusts. They are known for their pizza so they have to perfect the amount of time they cook their pizzas. Also I saw that the coal was on the side of the pizza so it's not that the pizza is sitting on top of the coal and getting burned on the bottom. If you happen to go let them know that you will not accept a burned pizza. That's what I am going to do the next time I go there. Other than that you will not be disappointed eating there.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Juliana's is hands down the best pizza I've had of the eight restaurants I tried in New York City this weekend, and possibly anywhere in my entire life. The white pizza is absolutely TO DIE FOR. Great springy crust, buttery garlic flavor, and excellent cheese. We also got half regular margherita with pepperoni. The topping was on the sparse side but really high quality. Every aspect was really flavorful.

The atmosphere is high class but the servers are not uppity. They even invited me to take close up pictures of the oven and of the cooks making pizza dough. They also have cannoli and pasta dishes but you should really order the pizza if you're here. The pizza was pricey IMO but it was probably normal for NYC (around $30 for a small pie, but small is actually a generous size).

I hear there's often a line for this place. I don't believe they sell slices, so this is a dine in establishment. Either way it's worth your time. Put Juliana's on your pizza list!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"You can feel the love.

I mentioned at length in my Grimaldi's Yelp review on how Grimaldi's over the years lost their touch as you can tell their quality dropping, especially once they moved to their new location to make a double decker restaurant to house more tourists (have to be honest).  Luckily the original Grimaldi's owner reopened a new restaurant at his original shop location, now with the name of Juliana's.

The immediate difference that I would be able to tell at Juliana's is the love that goes into each pizza.  You can see the pie being made in front of you and put in the oven as you wait.  At Grimaldi's something takes your order, they go away, someone new comes to serve you and has no idea who ordered what.  Julianas still has that family type environment.

The pizzas are great.  Had the #1 and #4.  Old school style, they don't let you substitute.  They want you to enjoy it the way it was intended to be made.  Though the pizza may not be as amazing as what Grimaldi's used to be 10+ years ago (at least the memory of what it used to be), it is still one of the best.  In my ranking of NYC pizzas (see below) it is currently second only to Di Faras in terms of whole pie restaurants.  You wont be disappointed, and you'll feel like you had an authentic NYC experience.  Whereas eating at Grimaldi's today, you'll feel like you're eating at a Planet Hollywood.  Well a better example might be Buca Di Peppo, but you get my point.

A couple of things Julianas has over Di Faras is that it's closer to Manhattan - not just because that's where I live but because it's less of a hassle to take visitors from out of town when they visit.  The other thing is that at certain parts of the day (2pm ish) there may be no wait, whereas Di Faras there is always always a wait.

FYI here is my own personal rating system and ranking list of some other pizza joints in NYC

5=worth a trip, something you'll crave
4=worth getting but only if you're already in the area
3=only worth it if it's free/discounted, not worth paying full price
2=would not even eat it if free, waste of stomach space
1=the place should shut down

The places are listed as best/better first if they share the same rating (I.e. Di Faras better than Julianas, etc.)

5's (whole pie) - Di Faras, Juliana's, Keste, Emily, L & B Spumoni

Juliana's Pizza,We got the #6 special. It was SO GOOD. And service is fast. Everyone was super nice and friendly. The pizza fills you up more than planned. We also shared the meatball appetizer (we were starving) and the flavor and texture was perfect.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"It's worth the hype.
Well, I take that back. It depends which place you go to. We had to decide between Grimaldi's or Juliana's. We ended up reading a few reviews online (some here on Yelp) and ended up choosing Juliana's.

We ordered their Margherita (small) and it was more than enough food. We had heard this place can get pretty busy, but we were here on a Thursday afternoon for lunch and it was pretty empty. We were seated right away and given water right away. We ordered some bottled drinks (diet coke) and then our pizza came out not long after.

The pizza was my kind of pizza. First off, I love a good thin crust or classic NYC pizza. So this fit the mold for me. The sauce was slightly sweet and we got a nice cheese stringy 'tude which I hope most pizzas have! Our server was nice, attentive and kept our drinks refilled!

I honestly don't know what the difference is between here and Grimaldi's. I think they're both probably pretty similar, but next time I'm in the city I'll need to try Gimaldi's to see ;)

I can say with certainty that we had a fantastic pizza experience at Juliana's.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Be prepared to wait in an out-of-the-door line near the river in NYC weather. But I'm telling you it's totally worth the wait. Their pizza is super thin, crispy, fresh cheese and tomato sauce. My favorite is just a classic margherita with fennel sausage. The meatballs are okay.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/julianas-pizza-brooklyn-5?osq=restaurants
Juliana's Pizza,"Be prepare to wait on the line for good 20-40 min depending on a day but its completely worth it and we have never been disappointed. Pizza is always good, service fast and friendly and the prices are ok.

Barn Joo 35,"I was in NYC this past weekend & my boyfriend and I came here every night for 4 days. Near Times Square, it's a convenient location & was beside our hotel. The convenient ""live wait"" times on yelp made it easy to get seats. You can add yourself to the wait list while exploring the streets of NY.

Service: Amazing! We were actually embarrassed that we came here 3 nights in a row..on the third night the manager sent us free Truffle Rice cakes & free Yakult because he noticed us from the previous nights! Also it seems that it is team service here which is always more efficient and faster in my opinion. The entire staff is so kind and ready to help. The management team were clearly aware of their customers , floor and staff. Very integrated.

Food: Excellent: the only thing we were dissa in was the Truffle bulgogi wraps , we couldn't taste the truffle and it kind of la led in flavour. Other than that , their Salmom Ceviche, peanut /walnut salad and soju cocktails were impressive and affordable.

Ambience: casual and modern place. Love the two floors and doesn't feel too cramped unlike other Korean tapas places I've been (esp in Toronto).

Overall I 100% recommend. If my boyfriend and I lived in NYC we would absolutely come here very often",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"My experience at Barn Joo 35 was not great.  

My cocktail was fine (Midtown Forsythia, $6 during Happy Hour.)

We ordered a hotpot, the Korean Army Stew, which was very disappointing. I thought it'd be a better version of what it sounded like, but the bowl was really just a hodgepodge of bad/cheap ingredients like pieces of wiener (""pork sausage"" according the menu), and what seemed like canned beans & other stuff, etc., along with some veggies and ramen noodles.

I think we may have ordered the worst item on the menu, & their other foods must be better & possibly worth a try, but at the same time, I'm flabbergasted that they'd serve that ""army stew"" like that at all. We did ask for guidance on the menu, so I wish the waiter would have steered us away from ordering that hot mess.

Otherwise, service was good. Ambience was good. Food was a joke -- on us.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Came here on a chilly, busy Friday night. Place was packed as expected but many other places were full so it seems you can count on the place because of capacity? Overall the food was alright but overpriced.

Let's start with the fried asparagus. I believe we got 5. This is when appetizers become a pet peeve. $10 is a bit much for what it is, but NYC. Why give an odd number if the appetizer is meant to be shareable? The next app was the Nacho Belly - pork belly, soy bean paste, tortilla chips and some other things that were pretty much garnish. Better than the asparagus and a more fair price, still I wasn't overly impressed but nice presentation. Again questionable share-ability if more than two people.

My main entrée were the NY Bites. Strange name compared to some of the other offerings. Not bad. I don't get the hub bub with everything being truffled though. The entrée was very meaty and I didn't feel cheated here so this gets a thumbs up.

Had cocktail which also was pretty good, but more impressed with presentation than the drink.

Overall though with high NYC prices for just passable entrees makes feel like I'm playing tourist coming to a place like this. I'm sure there are more fitting Korean spots. I'd probably come back for the same circumstances - other venues full, out with friends and I'm real hungry but that's about it.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Came here for lunch. We went around 1 and the place was relatively empty with only a few tables taken. As we ate it did get more crowded but still not too bad.

The service here is a bit slow and at times felt a little ""set it and forget it"". If you eat with two people you get a relatively small table, which can be a bit annoying with larger menu items like the Farmer's Meal.

We got the crispy chicken buns, the tuna poke and the farmers meal. The crispy chicken buns were my favorite, they tasted like Korean Katsu with the sauce Korean katsu sauce in a bun.

The poke was interesting, it was more of a cross between a chicken salad (the kind you get on a sandwich) and tuna than a more traditional poke mix. My boyfriend called it a ""midwestern poke"".

The farmers meal was okay. We got it with kalbi, but they serve it in cubed form and not LA Kalbi form. It was kind of fun to eat at first because of the wrapping but food wise was rather boring.

Cool place but probably won't be back. Seems like a good place to go for happy hour though.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Walked in 15 mins after I joined the waitlist on Yelp (this feature never gets old)

They seated is upstairs right away and were very prompt with everything.
We orderedd to bbq for two - the meat was extremely good quality but it lOoked and was a miniature meal. Tad disappointed with portions.

Tried the fried dragon roll which was extremely  delicious. I could actually  taste every little detail in the roll.

Also ordered their famous buns and the baos just melt in your mouth and the meat inside was bursting with flavors

We got our complimentary sake with check in.  They were so nice they didn't even associate us to show the check in. The sake was yummy!

Will defInitely go back and try more things on the menu",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"not to be biased but this placed had captured me since the first time I walked in. I almost never did this, but I've known this place will rate 5 before I even tasted the food.

ambience was perfect for casual lunch. average noise, not too loud. excellent service - swift, polite, amiable, and nothing weird.. cosy interior. we LOVE it. the menu has a good variety but it all revolves around Asian fusion.. we ordered Korean Taco (Bulgogi) which comes with Truffle Fries, Tri-Color Sashimi Salad, and Crunchy Tofu.

all the food was aesthetically pleasing. Beautiful plating. And comes in real decent filling portion. Honestly I've been to way too many overpriced restaurant with portion so small u left the place hungrier than when u came.

The sashimi salad was uber fresh and delicious! bulgogi was perfectly cooked, tender, well-seasoned, and all the components blend well together.. truffle fries was fragrant. crunchy tofu was incredible, i assume it was coated with sweet gochujang sauce and the batter was cornstarch or potato flour. every single other dish from other tables looked amazing as well. I would love to come back and I highly recommend this place",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Decent, but a bit small portioned. The soju looks small, but it will get you drunk! I shared these three dishes with my date, and it was decent! I thought the taste of it was on point with the army stew!

Dishes: 4/5
Environment 5/5 loved the tree and nature feel upstairs
Alcohol: 4/5 decent tasting and surprisingly strong.

Overall, I had a great time, bur food wise it could be a bit better since we have k-town right next door.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"My first review of 2020 and I want to star it with a 5-star gem!

Found Barn Joo on Yelp while looking for some good eats near the Empire State building on. Saturday night. It was easy to make a reservation on the app while we were walking toward the restaurant 10-15 blocks away. I was surprised there was availability for a part of 5 at around 6PM. The place was packed when we got there and because we weren't going to grill at the table, they lead us up to the, get this, 3rd floor. I couldn't believe how many tables they had.

All the staff we interacted with were welcoming and friendly, from the hostess, the gentleman who lead us to our table, our waiter, and I believe the manager.

We ordered so much food because everything sounded good. Fried asparagus, crispy tofu, popcorn chicken, veggie pancake, truffle fries, vegetable hot stone rice, and beef cube steak.

I also tried their sunset cocktail - Suntory whisky, juice, and bitters.

A wonderful dining experience with delicious food and superb service! Thank you Barn Joo!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Fun place to grab a bite and a drink. My boyfriend and I came to visit on Tuesday night around 6PM. The place was pretty crowded and loud, but we got a seat! The service was great as was the food.

We came for happy hour, so we each got a soju drink. I got an aloe one and he got a sour, both were quite good although very small.

We ordered 5 garlic soy wings (you have to order in orders of 5). They accidentally left out a wing, so they gave us 5 more wings on the house. Super nice people and great service. The wings were also REALLY GOOD (Not sure if this was because we were pretty tipsy though).

We got the crunch tofu, which I enjoyed as well. Nothing special though, but a solid dish nonetheless.

The truffle fries were also okay, but a good thing to munch on and tasted exactly how truffle fries should.

Finally, we also ordered the uni bibimbap. I liked how there were lots of eggs in the dish, and a lot to seaweed. I honestly feel like they could have skipped the uni because there wasn't a lot of it, and you could barely taste it. Otherwise, this dish was really good!

We ended up finishing everything - granted I was SUPER FULL - but had a great time. It's definitely a good place to go for a fun happy hour or dinner with friends.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"I honestly have never heard of this place until a friend invited me to a group dinner. I literally took a few looks a the food photos and I already had 4 things I knew I definitely wanted to order.

We went during the week, reservations made. I am prob going to suggest reservations if possible especially on nights where the flow of diners will be high.

The seats are a bit close to each other which made packing away our winter puffy coats a bit of challenge. Maybe if they had wall hangers that would be helpful.

Our server was prompt to get our drinks. I used my Yelp check in to get a complimentary shot of Soju. Yah!

Luckily, my friend were all on board and we ordered as a unit in terms of what we were going to eat.

Truffle Fries
Crispy Chicken Buns- comes with delicious sauce.
Japchae with Beef
Crunchy Tofu
Bulgogi hotstone
Tuna Mayo
Wings with soy garlic
Fried Tiger Roll.

Drinks- Hibiscus Lemonade (very tasty).
The serve brought over some complimentary Soju shots, not sure the name but they were very good.

We all enjoyed everything.  If I had to choose the least favorite, prob because I was so full on the other items, were the Japchae with Beef and Bulgogi Hotstone. Also, the day before I hate a similar dish to the Japchae so maybe my palate was just plateaued out.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Small space and packed with lots of customers. I'd advise to get here early on a weekend.

Funny enough, they said our table was gonna be a 30 min wait so we ended up chilling at a place nearby and ordered some drinks. Turns out the wait was only 5 mins, wonderful I better down this mai tai in 30 seconds.

Anyways I'm feeling pretty good going in, ordered the soju sampler which came with little lights to illuminate my drinks and show off their vibrant colors. They were all very tasty.

Ordered the fried tiger rolls and the bulgogi. Bulgogi is on par with some of the best I've had, very flavorful and they captured that sought after smokey taste as well.

There menu is extensive with tantalizing options, will order more again",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

Barn Joo 35,"A very busy Korean gastropub that takes some unique dishes and some Korean stalwarts and serves it on very small tables. The space is busy, with a wait on a Wednesday night. The service was very abrupt, seating us and the server dropped water on the table and disappeared for a while. Super noisy restaurant, though, very hard to hold a conversation across the table even as small as they were.

We tried:
- Crunchy tofu - not great, could have done with being less hard and dry, though the kimchi to the side was cool and refreshingly light
- Fried Tiger roll was too creamy/thick paste like in consistency. Also oily.
- The Popcorn Chicken done in a fryer basket was probably the best dish of the night, didn't even need the sauce.
- The japchae was ok, seafood version is lightly spicy, and I like the mini squid/octopus pieces
- The hotstone bowl of bulgogi was again ok, but lacked the variety of veggies that I'd get elsewhere and had too much rice.

Overall, so-so food, too noisy to talk, and too busy for me to come back.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Solid lunch option in the busy midtown area. When I do have time to run out for lunch to actually sit and eat, I like to come here. Their hot stone bimbimbap is filling and they have options: chicken, pork, and even tofu. They have some cool dishes, like Korean Americans fusion tapas. They also have really good cocktail drinks.

However the seating is very tight. Came here on weekdays during lunch hour, it's crowded. Came here on a Sunday for a early dinner, and it was packed.

I can see why Americans really like this place, but I think it's because they haven't tried authentic Korean food at better places. I mean..I had better sizzling hot stone bowls for much less than $18.00. Everything is way overpriced, but it is the city and it the food is ""instagrammable"" so I guess that makes it ok..I would still come here as it's conveniently located near my office and the service is efficient.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"This time I was confused when checking in with the host for my table. Like last time, I got on the waitlist, but instead of getting seated when I got the text saying my table was ready, I got to the restaurant and was told I needed to wait another 20-30 min. I was confused if the yelp waitlist was just another waitlist to get on before the official one? Idk.

They opened up a speakeasy on the 3rd floor for us to sit in as we waited. We ended up just staying there because you could order much of the same food as downstairs. We got the nacho belly and spicy charred chicken tapas along with a bulgogi stone bowl. They also honored the check in offer of fruit flavored soju shots. The food itself was tasty. The chicken was really spicy.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"I went here on a Friday night around 9 pm and had to wait about 30-40 minutes for a party of 2 off of the yelp waitlist.

We got the soy garlic wings appetizer, fries, and a bulgogi hot stone pot. All were tasty. Price is a little expensive for my liking so I'll usually share when I go here.

The union square location is definitely more comfortable, and accommodating for larger groups. This location is not really a comfortable setting, tables are very close for comfort. Best to come here with a small group.

Service was good, was able to get the attention of my waiter promptly each time. Overall, I like the food but I think there are better places in the area with similar food.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Came here after having been to the union square location years ago. Tried out the Farmers Meal, which came out on a beautiful spread, with plenty of food -- miso soup, kimchi, bulgogi, rice and lettuce/shisho wraps. I've been looking for a place that has these wraps for awhile after having some on a trip to Korea. Unfortunately the food was just okay, due to a lack of flavor and depth. The plate needed to come with more kimchi since the wraps otherwise tasted a bit bland.

Some friends tried out the fried chicken baos and the truffle fries which were good, but not amazing and a little pricey given the portion size. Overall I don't think I'll be back. There's so many other places to eat in ktown.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Quite disappointed with this meal after coming across so many recommendations by online platforms for Barn Joo. What I think we need is more Asian food writers commenting on Asian food, not white writers who claim an affinity for Asian food, but will not/have not been to Asian restaurants that might have less comfortable seating or do not have Western ideals of ""service"".

Barn Joo serves Korean tapas featuring traditional Korean dishes with a twist. I appreciate restaurants that attempt to modernize traditional cuisine, but a lot of these ""twists"" were unnecessary (truffle essence) and/or not well-executed (not-crispy fried chicken).

My favorite dish amongst what we ordered was the crunchy tofu, but mostly for the caramelized kim chi on the dish. The breading on the tofu itself was too thick; I craved for the lightness of Japanese agedashi tofu as I struggled to rip apart the tofu skin with my teeth.

1. Fried Tiger Roll (tuna, salmon, avocado, kani, chili mayo, eel sauce)
2. Crunchy Tofu (fried tofu served with caramelized Kimchi)
3. Crispy Chicken Bun
4. Galbi-Jjim (braised short ribs, carrots, dates, chestnuts, truffle essence with glass noodles)",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Came here on a Monday night after work for a quick meal with friends. We have heard so much buzz about this Korean gastropub we just had to try it! First off, the location is great, especially if you commute via train (it's a 10 minute walk from Penn).

Make a reservation, no matter what day of the week. The restaurant is two levels, and it started filling up around 6pm, as they have a happy hour menu. The four of us were seated, and our waiter brought us water and menus.

Their food options were so unique and trendy. We opted for a few appetizers, because they all looked delicious. We ordered the crispy chicken buns, calamari and Parmesan fries. Boy did the appetizers not disappoint!!!  They were fresh and super flavorful!

For our meals, we all ordered something different. I opted for the NY Bites, which was smoked beef and potatoes. It was alright, nothing be excited about.

Once i was time for dessert, we were excited. We ordered the cheesecake with fresh fruit, a churro bowl with vanilla ice cream, and the chocolate lava cake. They were delicious, and a big serving.

All in all, the food was okay, but the appetizers took the cake. The prices are on the higher side, but that's expected for a trendy, fresh Korean gastropub. Would want to try something new next time!! Service was great!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"2.5 stars. Weak for a Korean lounge. The truffle fries and fried tofu were okay but their popcorn chicken and army stew was weak. Definitely do not recommend the army stew because it lacked flavor and was a small portion for $30+ dollars. Ingredients were super cheap and they couldn't even afford to put in an entire ramen noodle. Maybe we ordered all the wrong things? But this definitely didn't satisfy our cravings for some dirty Korean food.

Also, last call was at 10PM for food even though they closed at 11PM? Pretty much felt rushed to finish and they were cleaning up by 1030.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"I was going to give Barn Joo 35 three stars because something intangible left me....unsatisfied. And I can't quite pick out what it was. The restaurant staff was wonderful, very knowledgeable, patient and quick.  I had the bulgogi hot stone bowl, chicken buns and truffle fries. The food wad presented beautifully and very Instagram-worthy. It ticked all the boxes! But I had much higher expectations from a restaurants with as many raving yelp reviews as Barn Joo. I think the issue was that the food while presented beautifully, tasted meh and overall was heavily fried and lacked essential flavor.

I'm told the union square location is bigger and better but have never been.

In the end, I gave barn joo four stars because my husband thought it deserved five and so we split the difference :))",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

This is not your typical Korean spot. It looks and feels more western than Korean. The food is true Korean. We all had rice bowls. Two spicy pork and one seafood. Perfect portion size for lunch. Piping hot, no make that lava hot! Favors are definitely designed for the American taste. I think they could push the flavor up a little. More veggies would be a nice add. Service is friendly and attentive, and fast.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"There's been a lot of buzz around Barn Joo and I was excited about finally having the chance to give them a try. Since they're very popular, they won't seat you until the entire party has arrived. This can be an amusing sight to see, as folks anxiously wait for their companions to arrive before the tables are snagged. We didn't have a problem for a party of 2 at 5:30 on a Tuesday. We had the seafood pancake and bulgogi hot pot (and a side of rice, not included with the bowl). They're definitely pricey for the portion size, but the food is so so good - high quality ingredients packed with flavor.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Came after Phantom of the Opera and it was fun fusion for sure! Last call was around 10:30pm so it worked out for us, the service was also quick at that time. Started with the chicken wings, and they really were the perfect texture, doubley crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. We ordered soy ginger and I wanted there to be a bit more sauce/flavor, but I would get the spicy version next time.

Next, we had the truffle rice cakes and cheese, which was so good! The combo of creamy cheeses and rice cakes was unique and yummy, it came out gooey and bubbly.

The bulgogi came as a mountain of meat, which was great. It was smoky and yummy, but didn't come with rice, so just be aware. Definitely a big, shareable entree.

Lastly, we got the spicy charred chicken, which wasn't our favorite. I love spicy food, but this felt spicy for the sake of spicy, and not for flavor per se. My friends couldn't take more than a few bites (so be warned, actually kind of spicy!).

This was too much food for the three of us but we had a good amount of leftovers for later. The ambience was ~hip~ and fun and there was a cool moon light that lit the place up. Would recommend.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"The wait wasn't too bad for 7pm on a Saturday night. We were seated upstairs, it's loud and noisy both downstairs and upstairs but filled with lots of energy.

Started off with crunchy tofu, veggie japchae, nutty green salad and a ginger limeade.

We both walked all over and walked back and forth on the Brooklyn bridge so we came with an empty belly and parched too.

The limeade ginger was so refreshing and nicely quenched my thirst.

The crunchy tofu was nicely crispy and soft on the inside, lots of flavors, the fried kimchi garnish was a good balance to the crunchy tofu.

The veggie japchae was delicious, nice peppery kick and lots of great veggies.

The nutty salad was topped with sweet crunchy almonds and the dressing gave it great depth and flavor pops.

Wondering imagining how we could get one of these in Michigan, would be so great in Ann Arbor or in Detroit and would be a frequent haunt for me for certain. There's nothing like it in MI at all. Maybe some food for thought to the owner. ;)

It's a Monday night and we are back for more. We were seated right away, upstairs too, downstairs seems too chaotic for me. It's before 7pm.

We ordered the limeade ginger again, the crunchy tofu, nutty greens and this time trying out the truffle fries and the popcorn chicken.

The crunchy tofu didn't disappoint and were just as good as Saturday night amidst the hustle and bustle of the weekend frenzy.

The popcorn chicken was also nice and crunchy and went nicely with the smoked sriracha BBQ sauce.

The nutty salad was as good as I recalled from Saturday night, but I did have to ask for more dressing as it was rather sparse on the coverage the first round.

The truffle fries didn't meet my standards for truffle fries tonight. They smelled of truffle oil, only faintly when they were brought to the table, but I couldn't taste the oil in any of the bites and the fries were over done for my liking. I like a nice golden yellow tint to my Idaho spuds. My hubby will eat any spuds since they are potatoes after all, but not me.

I will be back again for some more crunchy tofu, nutty salad, popcorn chicken and some more adventures here in the future. Until my next visit NYC and Barn Joo.

They have multiple soju drinks that you can get in a flight and man are they tasty! The chicken wings were cooked perfectly. They were crispy and flavorful. The chicken fondue was delicious. The chicken was good enough to be eaten alone. The fondue was just the right portion. The pork buns were amazing, the perfect bun!

Barn Joo 35,"Love tha ambiance of this modern Korean fare.  Reserve thru Yelp so we did not wait.  We sat in the back near the kitchen it is a tad bit more quiet.  

We ordered 5 dishes for the two of us.  We had a tempura based roll with an aioli.  Then a soft shell crab deep fried with home made tartar and a hint of truffle oil.  Then we had a bulgogi stone bowl followed by a crispy fried chicken bun and lastly their homemade vegetarian dumplings.  

Highlights were the soft shell and the chicken bao.
The sauce on and texture of the bao made the dish.  The soft shell crab I would order it again then had a way to keep it crunchy without getting soggy.

The restaurant was very loud inside, but decorated nicely and the staff was friendly as well. We ordered steamed pork dumplings to start that were flavorful and the perfect texture (also the sauce was delicious). We also decided on the bulgogi hot stone bowl and the chicken hot stone bowl. Both tasted great! The meat was tender and full of flavor and went so well with the rest of the veggies that come in the bowl.

We ended our meal with some cheesecake for dessert. It was a bit more savory than I am typically used to, but it went perfectly with the fruit and ice cream that it is served with! I would definitely come back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

Barn Joo 35 is a trendy and yummy Korean ""tapas"" spot without all the rush of tourists and overload of foodies door-busting. Went on a Sunday evening with my parents and my husband on a visit to Koreatown. Keep in mind the dishes are tapas-sized, so it's probably best to try multiple small dishes. I think we ordered 4-5 dishes altogether, which fared well amongst us all. But in all honesty, I can't recall all the dishes we had, but the ones that stood out were the Garlic Soy Chicken Wings (super tasty), Bulgogi and Jap Chae. We also ordered the deep fried gyozas, which just felt a bit too heavy.

The tapas sizes compared to the prices being on the heftier side and the fact that I can't remember all 5 dishes that we ordered qualify this place four stars rather than five. Just felt like we could've gotten more bang for our buck, with a bigger wow-factor!

Service was business, as I don't remember anything totally remarkable about it!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"One of my all-time favorite dinner spots in all of NYC. This restaurant is kind of on the outskirts of Koreatown which is nice because there's not as much foot traffic. While I usually bring dates here, my parents had been bugging me to bring them somewhere different than what they're used to. As a kid, we never had anything more than the chinese restaurant down the street so I was super excited to bring them here. My mom was a little reluctant at first but after I ordered everything she realized we were in the right place.

We ordered table bbq ribeye- super fresh, it would've been nice if the little stove's heat was more even as it felt like I was cooking a lot of it on one side. Either way, super delicious. We also ordered some tapas dishes: fried asparagus, 2 orders of crispy chicken buns, fried dumplings, roasted veggies and soy garlic wings. My parents were ABSOLUTELY blown away by the buns and all of my choices are what I generally go with so I wasn't surprised at all. Came before 6pm so got the wings half off which was nice. You can definitely end up spending a ton of money trying everything here but I 1000% recommend it if you're looking for something different.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Your very crowded Korean fusion with a long wait. The wait was about 30 minutes on a Friday evening although we join the Live waitlist so make sure you book a week in advance. The place is really crowded, very very crowded, but there is a second floor.

We had the kimchi pancake, bulgogi stone pot, galbi-jjim, litchi and aloe soju cocktail. The good: litchi/aloe soju cocktail, kimchi pancake. The kimchi cake is thicker than your usual Korean pancake loaded with kimchi, you immediately notice it's homemade and very unique. We loved both soju cocktail with uniquely cubed ice and blueberry in each. Both were not very sweet, but the balance between juice and soju was perfect. Another highlight was the rib stew (galbi-jjim). We loved how the ribs were very tender and the carrots/radish were well stewed. However, the rice noodle was placed at the very bottom and unfortunately did not absorb any sauce and therefore looked and tasted awful. The bulgogi pot was as expected, good but nothing to write home about.

The service was on par with other trendy Korean places in midtown. Price was also reasonable for the portion.

Barn Joo 35,"I heard about this place for a while but finally had it now!

Please note this place is a Tapas Restaurant, so you know to not be as surprised as my friends and I when we saw the tiny plates.

It's another dimly-lit Korean cuisine restaurant serving alcoholic drinks and Korean dishes, which there are plenty of in Midtown. But personally, this might be slightly better in that they look out for their Yelpers with free shots upon check-in! The shot was pretty delicious too, nice and fruity!

The food is a hit or miss. Personally, I really enjoyed the $1 Happy Hour wings. The Soy Garlic wings were fried just right and were delicious, especially given the price.

I thought the Truffle Rice Cake & Cheese was going to be good, but it was too heavy and mochi-like. I understand why this dish would be tiny.

The Crunchy Tofu was not what I imagined. It was sweet, and just covered in that sauce.

I would definitely go back here for the Happy Hour wings but avoid the tapas.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"This place was amazing. I've been eyeballing it for awhile but never had a chance to stop by. They don't take reservations so I joined the waitlist via Yelp. I'm not sure if it's a Yelp issue or a Barn Joo 35 issue but it was confusing that I mentioned to the hostess that I was on the waitlist and she had to check-in me in even though I hadnt received a notification yet. I'm not sure what would have happened if I just waited at the bar next door and never checked in other than the waitlist. Not a big deal.

I waited for about 45 minutes before my table for two was ready. We were seated immediately when I approached the hostess. The restaurant was extremely busy but the staff was on top of it. We never waited an unreasonable amount of time for anything. My friend and I had a few beers and soju and then the bulgolgi, chicken wings, pork dumplings, popcorn chicken, sides of rice, and a few other things and all of it was excellent. The food here is incredible as is the cocktails.

Service was on point and was very attentive. This was a great experience.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Came here for the star factor! Upon entry, we decided it's trendy and hip with its rough plaster exposed concrete wall on one side and reclaimed wood on the other it's bigger than it looks with a second level.

We ordered crispy tofu which was tasty but found the hard outer crust on the tofu way too thick and hard, the side of caramelized kimchi was tasty. We also ordered the barn special chicken boa, which I highly recommend! Soft squishy white roll stuffed with fried chicken and shredded cabbage! We also ordered a spicy pork stone bowl which is sizzling hot, is a mixture of whole grain rice, veggies and spicy pork (not that spicy), a bowl of hot soup and your choice of truffle fries, which we got or your choice of salad. The plates are perfect for sharing which is a great way to enjoy the variety of dishes here and avg price is about $15 per plate. It's also

Barn Joo 35,"We have been to the union sq location before and this was our first time here.There was a wait time of around 45 min and we waitlisted on yelp before reaching there.When we reached the place there was still a wait of 15-20 min but we were seated at the bar.We ordered a few drinks and chicken wings.Our table was ready by the time we finished our drink.The garlic parmesan chicken wings were yummy.Perfectly crunchy and sticky on the outside and juicy on the inside.
We ordered fried chicken bao,kimchi udon mad chicken hot stone bowl for our mains.
Everything was soo delicious.The service was quick and efficient.

Barn Joo 35,"A fun spot with excellent cocktails and Korean-influenced tapas and a modern moon/barn vibe. I made a yelp reservation for 3 people around happy hour and when we arrived, we were seated right away. For drinks, while I only tried 3 of their 5 soju cocktails ($6 during happy hour), they were so refreshingly delicious that I would say yes to all of them.

Then from their dinner menu, we shared 6 dishes. With farm-to-table ingredients, fresh flavors were obvious in every bite:

TRUFFLE RICE CAKE & CHEESE had the yummy comfort of mac-and-cheese but with chewy pasta rice balls.

ROASTED VEGETABLES- Get this!!!!!!!!!! Veggies never tasted so good! (Brussel sprouts, carrots, baby potatoes, topped with maple toasted almonds and chives.)

HOTSTONE BOWL OF BULGOGI (soy-marinated ribeye)- hearty downhome goodness with rice and sautéed veggies.

WINGS- A must!!! The Hot & Spicy and Soy-Garlic options were both so good!

KOREAN ESCARGO- steamed whelk sautéed with clarified butter and a spicy veggie salad was a little overdone but the flavor combination was good. I worry about inconsistency so I wouldn't get it again.

With legit drinks and mostly good food within such a vast menu, I'd definitely return.

NOTES/TIPS:
**Happy Hour 4-6pm Mon.-Fri.
**While they're open daily, they don't open til noon.
**Good service in that we were in-and-out within one hour but we had to ask for the check.
**Restrooms are downstairs and not wheelchair-accessible.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Trusty yelp lead me to Barn Joo 35 since I needed a place to eat in the Midtown area not far from the Port Authority or Path. 4.5 stars with hundreds of reviews?!? You know I have to try it.

It is a cool spot where you can get tapas style asian food. It was a good start to the meal with some solid drinks and a nice vibe. This is where things went south and really hurt their ratings. They made us close out mid-meal and continued bothering us to sign the check. Very unprofessional. I understand they want to get the checks so the servers can close out but you can't badger a customer to sign the check.  Be considerate that the customer will sign just be patient.  Horrible service.

It is a shame because the food is good here. The Chicken wings with fries were good. The wings had an awesome crunch to them and the flavor was on point. The ""spicy"" wings are also not that spicy. The vegetable dumplings were ok. Not sure what veggies are in there but I couldn't figure it out and it had a weird flavor.  The best thing we had were the crispy chicken buns.  I would definitely reorder those!

Overall, if the server didn't pull that stunt then I would have considered 4 star but no chance they get that now. Good food but no way I feel comfortable giving more than 3 stars.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Stopped in for a quick dinner and it didn't turn out to be so quick. We were here right before the HH / specials deals were done - tried the wings, and they were really dry unfortunately and underwhelming in terms of seasoning. The place is very cute but I do find that the seats and tables are annoyingly shaped where I can't hang my purse or coat comfortably anywhere. I think there is a small coat rack in the front but that's not my style. I don't mind coming back to try other things since their specials are always changing. I also wasn't full but I felt that I've already spent enough money for the meal.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"HAPPY HOUR HAPPY HOUR HAPPY. All I need to say!

Drinks. Oysters. Wings. In.

Barn Joo has two locations, one of 35th street (this one), and union square. If you are interesting in their oyster happy hour, then it will be at their Union Square location.

Their food is very good. I suggest getting there before happy hour starts because it does get PACKED. If you happen to get there 20-30 minutes before, they tend not to sit you down..and it is last round for those sitting already.

They have tons of different menu items to chose from, and great cocktails to choose from. Pretty cool spot of Korean tapas. The service is really quick, and they are really attentive. Which is good, because even though they are busy.. they are still providing great service.

I did get their table Korean bbq, which I didn't think was worth it given the amount of meat they give you and for the price. When they say it is a small table kBBQ, it really is a small table bbq.

Definitely a place to check out after work for drinks and tapas!

Major plus; Yelp Reservations and Yelp NoWait!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Went to this place for lunch and I LOVE IT!

Their hot stone bowls were amazing. I had the eel bowl and that eel was the best I've ever had. The meat was fresh and the skin was so thick. It was delicious. Their wings and fries are amazing as well.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"This Barn Joo is pretty big. I went in with my friend but our party wasn't full yet so the busy receptionist said to tell her whenever the third person arrives. We decided to wait outside and the lady had a chance to catch her breath, she came out to tell us that we could be seated upstairs with a more limited menu (third floor) which would be more private and quiet. We saw the menu and decided to just get seated while waiting for our friend. It was actually perfect for us because we didn't come for kbbq, we came for some bibimbap and it was more private/quiet? Sign us up!

We got to the third floor and was seated immediately with menus in front of us. After our friend had arrived, we were able to order almost immediately with our appetizer of fries coming out shortly after our order. Our bibimbap also came out fast too (though there was a slight confusion because the waiter asked us if we wanted brown or white rice and when one of my friends asked for brown, the waiter said it only comes in white rice? Which is funny because why give us an option if there really is just one? LOL)

Overall, the food was good but a little overpriced. Would I come back? Probably not in the immediate future but it was definitely a good experience to finally try Barn Joo.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Ordered tuna mayo, roe hotstone, and omurice. Superb. An odd blend of creative yet traditional, bold yet conservative. I saw omurice in a Korean drama and I finally know how good it tastes. My wife really liked the tuna mayo.

Barn Joo 35,"We came for dinner on a weekday and there was no wait.

Popcorn chicken was really good. It's a large serving size.
Nacho belly appetizer wasn't all that great. I felt like it was a bit dry and an odd combo. Forgettable at best.
The seafood kalguksu soup was amazing. Lots of noodles and seafood. The soup was flavorful and the noodles were chewy. Perfect for a cold winter day.
Galbi-Jjim is marinated but also has a bit of truffle on it. Meat quality is superb and the glass noodles were delicious.
Korean army stew is filling but has lots of processed meats. Tasty but not a fan of all the processed food.

Loved most of the dishes. Service was fairly prompt as the food came out quickly.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Had a hard time finding this place.  There were protests of some kind all along 5th Avenue, forcing us to get out of our cab and walk/run the rest of the 10 blocks it took to get to the restaurant before they would be forced to give our table away to someone else.  Needless to say we made it there with about a minute to spare, although we were a bit sweaty and out of breath.

When we first walked in, it immediately apparent like a cool spot for a bite to eat.  It had that ""hidden gem"" sort of feel.   Very casual,  but very authentic Asian vibe to it.  Not that touristy, Americanized version of Asian Fusion places you usually see.  

Checked in through yelp right away, and was pleased to see I actually got a free shot of alcohol.  It was really good too.  Some sort of orange liquor.  We sat down in mildly uncomfortable chairs, but the menu looked incredible.  Really great looking hot pots and raw seafood, but I had my eyes on the tapas section.  I love trying a bit of everything.

First we had the dumplings.  Out of this world.  Perfectly crispy outside and delightful flavors on the inside.  Next we had the chili shrimp.  Fried tempura style and had a nice kick to them.  The chicken wings were also pretty outstanding.  They had this honey-based sauce that I wish they would sell by the bottle.  They also had a bit of a kick to them.  

My girlfriend and I have become a big fan of Bao now so we had to try their fried chicken and pork buns.  The buns themselves were perfectly soft and wonderful.  The pork ones were good, but the fried chicken ones were our favorite.  They had an extra element of crispiness that really contrasted well with the softness of the buns.  

My main dish was the Spicy pork, and I couldn't have been happier.  Spice level was about between mild and medium, my perfect sweet spot for spiciness.  The pork itself was really perfect.  Probably my favorite dish of the night.  

Surprisingly, they had more desserts than your typical Asian place.  They had such goodies as cheese cake and molten lava cake, but I decided to get the churros.  Didn't think an Asian place would make such great churros, but they were awesome.  Even came with delicious ice cream.  A great end to a great dinner.

Never would have found this place if it weren't for yelp.  So glad I did though.  Feel like I was lucky to experience a meal here while on my short trip to NYC.  Anyone who lives even remotely near here should give it a try.  You will love their food.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

What we ordered:
Truffle Rice Cake & Cheese - a unique twist on the traditional spicy rice cake dish Koreans love with added cheese
Fried Soy Garlic Dumplings
Spicy Charred Chicken - again, the cheese on top was a great touch

The food here, although slightly overpriced, was amazing. I loved all 3 of the tapas we ordered, and there is plenty more on the menu I would like to try next time I come. The interior had a very nice pub vibe to it as well - would definitely recommend to a friend!

Barn Joo 35,"I came to Barn Joo 35 on a Wednesday night after a long day. We got there around 6pm and there was plenty of space but the restaurant filled up closer to 7pm.

We got the Truffle Corn and Cheese ($10) and the Kimchi Udon, which I believe was a special that was around $14. Both dishes are on the smaller side, more tapas style. Two dishes as satiating but definitely, I would not consider being full after sharing the two. I would say maybe aim for 3 dishes (1 entree and 2 tapas) for a group of 2. The Truffle Corn and Cheese came in an adorable mini skillet. The rice cakes were in this fun and unique ""boba shape"". The Kimchi Udon was good as well. It had a good flavor and it wasn't spicy.  

Overall, a pretty good place to grab food after work. The menu here have ample dishes to share so definitely come with a small group to sample their menu. I would say the ideal size for this restaurant is 2-4.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

Barn Joo 35,"Dear Barn Joo 35,
I was drafting a review in my head while waiting and had to erase my brain and start over after you gave yourselves a redo.

Thanks for turning what could have been an extremely shitty experience into an extremely great one. After a kitchen snafu that brought me a non-veg dish instead of a veggie one, you went above and beyond to make things right, and my replacement dumplings were delish. The tofu and mushroom hotstone bowl was so flavorful and even though I had to get seconds on the spicy sauce, I was able to make it completely to my taste, as spicy as I wanted!!!! YUM. I wanted to finish but couldn't, and the stoneware was so hot it took me a drink and a half to be able to eat it (but, it was warm until my last bite!). The jalapeno margarita was divine, not sweet, just the right amount of spice, so props to the bartender. It worked perfectly with my dish!

I would highly recommend you and even though I'm not a big rice-eater, would come back in a heartbeat. Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for making things right, it's the acknowledgement of a mistake and the attempt to correct that means so much in this ever-changing world of restaurants, customer service and the ability for online platforms to make or break a biz, so I respect you for coming clean and earning my trust!

Barn Joo 35,"Barn Joo is a real gem.

I used to work in the area and would occasionally come for lunch with my coworkers. I always get the lunch special - two buns or two tacos with a side (salad or truffle fries... it's obvious which you should choose) for $16ish. The fish buns are to die for - super crispy and flavorful. The truffle fries are good too, though I will say the meal is about 70% fries (by volume).

When I dine in, I usually do the dolsot bibimbap with bulgogi, which is wonderful - the rice gets crispy in the hot stone bowl and the beef is really well seasoned.

It's usually quite busy, so I'd recommend getting there on the earlier side for dinner - I've been able to walk in at 6pm without too much trouble.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"We live in Manhattan and dine in Bar Joo's two restaurants frequently. We usually go to the one in Union Square, but visit this location several times a year.

Our last visit on 12/29 Sunday is unexpectedly a very bad one. The host, a young lady with a thick Korean English accent, who's in a white top shirt and worn a pair of black glasses, is rude to the level that's undiscreditable. She was the only person wearing a different shirt that we assumed she's the manager. It was raining and very cold out. We were a group of 7, with a baby in stroller but the baby wasn't counted. There were other big groups waiting. She constantly rudely spoke to us customers waiting for tables to move, spikily looked at the stroller our baby was sleeping in, even asked us go outside to wait - seriously?

We were only willing to wait because we were told it's only 10-15 minutes wait.

Its understandable that 15+ people waiting in it's tiny door area is blocking the way, but there's no place to wait since it's rainy out. All the groups just stayed and waited and this seemed to really bother her.

Her attitude was impatient, spoke with sharp short rude sentences, and bossing customers around. No one said anything but she's indeed making a fool of herself. Everyone was the same, just wanted to wait for a table, sit and eat.

We were guided to our table within 15 minutes. While we were getting ready to sit down, this rude lady ran over loudly questioning "" do you have 7 people? Is that including the baby?"" She's giving us a very ugly face and also being very nasty to the two waitresses who took us in. I had to tell her yes we do have 7, not including the baby. Also, at this point I have no more tolerance for her obnoxious attitude and had to firmly telling her directly that her attitude is rude and unacceptable. We would appreciate if she talked to us with some respect.

She didn't say anything back but angrily and embarrassedly walked away.

Really? This is a manager's attitude? Walked away without an apology?

The rest of the meal, it was also not fine. The waitresses kept on forgetting giving us utensils, soup without a spoon, not refilling water after requesting multiple times.  

Also, even though it's a Korean restaurant, they don't give you more kimchi to go along with the food, Which is unheard of and against Korean dinning culture.

And because we were a part of 7, we got charged 20% tip automatically. We are very generous in tipping. But this kind of low quality service doesn't worth to be tipped, and we had to pay so much for be disrespectfully yelled at with completely incompetent services.

This restaurant has a severe problem in staff training. Even the food is pretty good, it doesn't worth our time and energy to be rudely treated and not being able to even have water to drink.

Go to the one in union square. It's 100 times better operated and a lot more food options.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"I had an early dinner at Barn Joo 35 last month with a couple of friends, meeting up before 5:00 on a Monday in advance of a nearby event. This put us there during happy hour, which seems like as good a time as any to eat here. No wait, and plenty of food and drink on special.

The place was comfortable with a bustling but relaxed Korean drinking hole vibe. (It reminded me of Atoboy, actually, to the point that I wondered for a second if it had taken over the same space.) Service was great, not least because one of my friends knew someone in management, who sent us free chili shrimp.

I'm pregnant, or I would've been all over the happy hour drink specials. I was able to partake in the food, though. We ordered six Barn Joo soy garlic wings, which were actually a little blander than expected but still good, especially for a dollar each. We also got the crunchy tofu, a sophisticated version of dubu kimchi, one of my favorite Korean bar dishes, with fried tofu and caramelized kimchi. We ordered a taco sampler, too, which came with three tacos--spicy pork, beef, and chicken, I believe. I got the spicy pork, and that was quite tasty, a Korean taco with guacamole, pico de gallo, and sour cream.

We supplemented our happy hour orders with a couple items off the regular dinner menu, as well as the complimentary chili shrimp. The galbi buns were solid, pillowy buns with thick slabs of sweet Korean barbecue and a bit of slaw. I also enjoyed the uni bibimbap, a flavorful rice bowl with a few pieces of sea urchin and a lot of colorful, crunchy roe, as well as pickled radish and some greens. I'm glad we got the chili shrimp, too, as it was delicious--fried shrimp served with a sweet and spicy chili sauce.

I had a lovely time at Barn Too 35. I liked the food, service, and atmosphere, and would recommend it for happy hour or any other time you might want contemporary Korean fare in a fun, casual environment.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

The service was quick and friendly and I was quickly seated. They have all different kind of bibimbap but I got the one with bulgogi which was a great choice. It has the flavor I loved and it was good mix with all veggies. I left the restaurant very full and happy.

The signature Soju cocktail, Purple Rain was a light, fruity drink. I would definitely come back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"First time at this location. I loved the other one but this one does not compare! I brought my friends here for lunch and we all left disappointed. We didn't even want the leftovers because nothing was that good.

The jap chae was really bland. Truffle fries lacked truffle flavor. Soft-shell crab was underwhelming. Crunchy tofu was ok, but did not taste like kimchi.

In conclusion, we ate, but reluctantly. I was pretty embarrassed I brought them here",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"The aesthetic of this place is really cool! It's designed like an actual barn with shiplack walls and ambient lighting. There's a big moon in the center of the restaurant!  

Service was fast and friendly. We did the sample of the signature drinks which was $27 and included a good sized portion of four different alcoholic beverages. My favorite was the purple rain and me and my date ended up getting two additional rounds of purple rain afterwards thanks to the sampler.

We're pescatarian and there was a lot of options on the menu for us. They had a special for a umi paella which was well seasoned and had some complexity to the flavoring without overdoing it. We started with that and then order the fish bao buns, soft shell crabs, fried tofu, and roasted vegetables. We liked everything. The roasted vegetables had really tasty almonds on them and it was a mildly sweet and savory dish and the roasted tofu was really good overall. We're from Maryland so the soft shell crabs were our least favorite(we have very high standards for this in Maryland lol) but it was still good.

The fish bao buns were so good we ordered them twice.

Highly recommend this place if you're looking for Korean and Korean fusion for a date night or a gathering with friends.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Really good, cute little location. I went during happy hour and the prices were really good. Wings were good and rice bowls were bomb as well (not sure which one I had though). Small, kind of packed location but a good spot for happy hour",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"I went for a lunch on a Friday afternoon. The place was full, but got a seat right away. Lychee soju, which I got for Yelp check in, was delicious but tiny though. Crunchy tofu was an excellent appetizer. May be my favorite thing there. For entree I ordered omurice with salad. By mistake they gave omurice with truffle fries, but gave salad later. So I got both salad and truffle fries with omurice. Salad seems to me like a rip off compared to truffle fries. Truffle fries was really good with good truffle flavor, especially with the orange sauce (tasted like fry sauce) it came with. My recommendation is to go with truffle fries with omurice, instead of salad. Chicken Katsu was really crispy. I wish they could have poured a lot of curry on top of it, rather than giving a tiny cup of curry on the side.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"My boyfriend found Barn Joo on Yelp last year when he was in town for work and hasn't stopped talking about his meal here, so naturally I had to take my family this week while in town. H O L Y C O W it totally lived up to the hype he created!! We showed up at 5pm with a party of 8 and were seated right away. Our waitress was awesome - informative, confident, polite, and attentive. We got an array of appetizers and happy hour drinks, including soy garlic wings, truffle fries, fried veggie dumplings, a tiger sushi roll, and crispy chicken buns. Wings were just $1 for happy hour which is a steal because they were big and perfectly cooked. The dumplings were huge and overstuffed, the fries and spicy mayo were amazing, the sushi was FANTASTIC, and the crispy chicken buns were ""the best I've ever had"", according to my mom's post on Facebook. And she would know, since she lived in Korea.

For dinner, we pretty much all got hot stone bowls except for one person, who had a mussel and oyster hot pot - HUGE portion and huge pieces as well, absolutely worth the money. The hot stone bowls had wild rice instead of white, which threw me off at first but ended up being a great texture. The mushrooms in the vegetarian bowl were amazing, and my chicken was cooked perfectly.

I would highly recommend Barn Joo to anyone looking for a good happy hour, good tapas to share, or great Korean food.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"This Korean gastropub is located in midtown Manhattan (Koreatown), on 35th Street near 6th Avenue.  They serve some great fresh oysters and other pub fare and some nice drinks.  The place is a bit dark, but in all, a nice atmosphere.  I liked it very much!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,Pretty good.  Tried the fish Katsu and it was crispy and well done. A bit too much breading for my taste but still yummy.  The fried rice that came with it was great.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Two of us came here around 9 PM Friday night. Koreatown usually gets pretty packed around this time, but we were lucky to get seated without a wait. The ambiance was hip & lively and the service was fast. It's definitely a great place to eat for a fun date night or with a group before going out.

Their food is tapas style with a few shared mains/entrees.   What I love about this place is that their menu gears more towards trendy/fusion rather than traditional. It allows me to try new fun flavors while still satisfying my Korean food craving.

It was hard to narrow it down, but two of us decided to order the fried tiger roll and truffle rice cake off the main menu, and the fire chicken fondue and uni bibim paella (for 2) off their daily specials. This turned out to be the perfect amount of food. I didn't expect the sushi to be good but it turned out to be a yummy appetizer. The truffle rice cake was also really enjoyable. The truffle flavor is mainly in the cheese, and was really satisfying without being too overpowering. I enjoyed having it with the bread, which was light and crunchy, but it did become a little too heavy to finish when we ran out. My absolute favorite was the fire chicken fondue. The fire chicken flavor was amazing, and I couldn't get enough of the cheese. The only slight disappointment was the uni paella, which after devouring the previous dishes totally lacked any seasoning or flavor, which sucked because we had such high hopes for it.

Overall, Barn Joo 35 is a really cool, trendy place that I'm definitely coming back to with friends to try the other tapas I missed!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"This restaurant definitely deserves a high rating. I've dined here 3 times and each time has been a wonderful experience.

I highly recommend the tiger roll ( get the bigger portion because you are going to want more!) and the fried asparagus on the appetizer list. The fried asparagus is so unique in texture and is breaded so perfectly, it is absolutely divine. The tiger roll creates some beautiful flavors in your mouth. It's light, but filling.

I have also had the steamed bun bulgogi ( classic and delicious) and I've enjoyed the stone bowl for bibimbap.

I haven't been disappointed with anything so far, and I look forward to trying more items out on their menu.

The service has always been great and I love the atmosphere of this restaurant, very tasteful.

4.6/5",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"This place was a great fast, interesting dinner in a cool space that definitely added a hip feel to my wife's and my 10th anniversary trip to New York. The space was done in a cozy, pseudo-industrial way with low lighting and lots of warm wood tones. The atmosphere makes it a great date spot.

The food is Korean small plates and you should expect to get ~2 per person for dinner. We got the chicken buns, the crispy tofu, the dumplings, and the bulgogi hot stone.

The chicken buns were stunning with tons of complex flavors going on all combining to just be a delightful experience all around. We would get them again in a heartbeat.

The crispy tofu was good, but it over emphasized the sriracha for me without other flavors to balance things out. Not that it was bad, but next time I'd probably try something else on the menu instead since there were more things I wish I'd been able to try.

The dumplings were good, but much more fried and crunchy than I expected. The sauce that came with them picked them up a level though. I'd probably get them next time.

The bulgogi hot stone rounded out the end of the meal as well as we started with the chicken buns. The first bite was a bit bland, but stirring everything up with the gochujang sauce turned it into one of the best bulgogi rice bowls I've ever had.

It's worth noting that the place was pretty packed and there was a good line when we showed up, but we'd used the Yelp service to wait in line online and so were seated essentially immediately.

We also shared a drunken tiger cocktail that interesting and good, but not as good as the food.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Go at lunch and be treated to the Farmer's lunch of miso, brown rice, pickled radish and kimchi and your choice of entree and a basket of cucumber, lettuce, shiso leaves and a mild pepper. We selected Galbi, bulgolgi and spicy pork.

The bulgolgi was on par--tender, moist and satisfying. The spicy pork had a lovely gochujang slice and flavor burst. But those succulent cubes of charred grilled Galbi dominated the meal. It was so good you dont really need the gochujang on the meat.

The miso was rustic and the restaurant is not likely to refill your kimchi.

We also ordered an Uni Bibimbap. Nutty, creamy lobe of properly temped perfection accompanied by colorful roe.

All of this for $18 per set??? Lunch is where it's at!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Very yummy. I am impressed with Asian food and gastropub being not only serviceable but delicious. My friend and I came during lunch and the line wasn't too bad. We were seated within minutes.

Menu is reminiscent of traditional Korean food with an American twist. Fairly simple front and back layout and prices were fairly reasonable.

Ordered
-Hot and spicy pork dumplings (3.5/5). Golden fried crispy. A-ok. The first dumpling was good but should've low-key ordered the soy garlic version.
-Crunchy Tofu (5/5). Super tasty and went well with the caramelized tofu.
- BBQ Chicken Hotstone Bowl (4/5). Have had this dish at many Korean places but this was one of my favorites. It was hot, the rice was cooked and turned to perfection, and the red chili sauce provided was complementary and delightful.
- Banana Pudding (4/5). Not a fan of desserts but it did taste good. The ice cream was cold but melted in your mouth with a hot bite of the banana bread.

Enjoyed Barn Joo and would recommend it for lunch or for some late night dranks and munchies.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"This may not be the most authentic of K-Town experiences, but you should've known that from the moment you saw the words ""Korean gastropub."" And that doesn't mean it isn't a good time.

You've got to decide if you want:

1. The more affordable, more banchan, more Korean experience.

2. A meal that may cost a little more, but will deliver more attractive plates, more items that appeal to an American palate, and in my experience, far, far better service.

If you want the former find a different spot, preferably a place that only exists on the second floor of a building around here.

If the latter is your style, you're right where you need to be. Just know that if you have Korean friends they will be appalled at the prices, whereas they're pretty standard for a Manhattan dinner out.

Don't be ashamed, either; both types of Korean meals have their place. This is an excellent introduction to Korean food for people that aren't as familiar, and even if you are familiar, Barn Joo has a lot of upside.

Namely, the food is excellent and well-presented. I have eaten and enjoyed wings, pancakes, traditional Korean truffle fries, galbi, tacos, that mac and cheese-esque thing, bibimbap, japchae, and more.

If I were you, I'd wash it all down with shots of soju and beer backs, but that's just because I'm not as into the soju cocktails.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Overall, really solid Korean food with a bit of a flair but lacking a bit of spice. My favorite were the seafood japchae noodles- they were full of flavor and had a copious variety of seafood in them. The hot stone bowl with bbq chicken is a must try but the chicken was lacking some much needed flavor. The miso soup it came with was phenomenal and so were the truffle fries. Really unique menu options and great spot for a night out with friends! One negative is the service, it's kind of slow and the staff isn't super friendly or attentive.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,Came here with a large group last weekend. They would not seat us until our entire group was there. We were seated upstairs at a couple of tables pushed together. The space was kind of tight. The seats were extremely small and it was very noisy. The service was pretty good and we enjoyed our complimentary soju cocktail shots with our Yelp check in. I ordered the beef bulgogi bowl  served over rice The dish was OK. Nothing to write home about. It looked nothing like the colorful photographs online. It was all brown. I had to add all of the gochujang sauce to give it some flavor. I've been to South Korea and I've eaten at some other Korean restaurants in the area. This place is really just average..,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

the tables in this place are seated so incredibly close to each other that you can literally touch elbows with your neighbor and join in on their conversations. also the tables are tiny, so there is very little space for the food when it arrives. very attentive wait staff. food was delicious. wings were fantastic. army stew was a nice portion.

Barn Joo 35,"Came to Barn Joo 35 for their happy hour (Monday - Friday, 4-6pm) as a group of 4. We took full advantage of their HH menu. The wings are $1 each, minimum order of 5 wings, and you have the choice of soy garlic (the best) or hot & spicy. The wings are perfectly crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The basket of truffle fries ($5) is nice to share. The fries are thick, crispy, and you can definitely taste the truffle. All of the soju cocktails ($6 each) are great. We ordered Midtown Forsythia, Aloe Elixir, and Passionate Barn Joo.

The restaurant gets very busy so I recommend making a reservation through Yelp. Service is great and food gets served quickly. Check-in on Yelp to get a free soju shot!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Came here because I was craving Korean fried chicken. I also liked the fact that it was a tapas place and wanted to try different things.

We got the korean seafood pancake, 6 hot and spicy wings, bulgogi hotpot, tuna salad, and lastly truffle fries. Honestly, none of the food was that great. My favorites would be the tuna salad and the wings, but they weren't super special either. The portions are incredibly small and really expensive for the price. Truffle fries didn't taste like truffle fries at all.

Lastly, service was decent but not amazing. Probably wouldn't come back again.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Overall, everything was good, but the food was super salty. We got ribs and bulgogi, neither of which came with rice, which was strange to me. You can get rice on the side, but it surprised me when the food came out as just a big plate of meat. The truffle fries were also fresh and piping hot, but between the fries and the meat, everything was overwhelmingly salty! We drank the whole pitcher of water quickly and I was still thirsty. The soju cocktails tasted great, especially the passionfruit, but were weak in terms of alcohol. This place has good happy hour discounts until 6 PM ($6 a soju cocktail), but I wouldn't pay regular price for a weak drink.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"I came here on a Thursday night with a friend for drinks and some appetizers. I ordered a Seoul Mule, which was pricey but very large.

Barn Joo 35,"A Korean fusion restaurant a few blocks up from the rest of K-town. Went on a Saturday night and, as expected, there was a long wait. Luckily, you can join the live waitlist on Yelp, which saved us a lot of time!

We tried the kimchi jeon, the bulgogi dolsot bibimbap (hotstone bowl), and the spicy pork bbq. The food was decent, but everything I tried I had a better version of elsewhere. Portions also tend to be on the smaller side for the price and they don't give any banchan (side dishes). As a Korean American, I need my free side of kimchi! Somewhat surprisingly, the bread pudding dessert was absolutely delicious and I would definitely order this again.

Unfortunately, the service was very slow, although I can understand given how packed it was on a weekend night.

Would possibly check out again for their happy hour deals (M-F from 4-6PM), especially for those $1 oysters.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Notes:
- very perceptive waiter
- came around 9:45
- 10% off when you pay in cash

Went to go watch Aladdin and afterwards decided to eat at Barn Joo to try out the uni bibimbap. We arrived around 9:45pm on a Thursday and was seated immediately. As for the branding, it's a modern twist with some vintage objects through the restaurant and mainly serve Asian fusion. I'm not a big fan of Asian fusion or gastropubs. Barn Joo is definitely an exception.

I heard good things about the uni bibimbap but I couldn't have expected such variety of flavor and texture with each bite! The waiter was very perceptive and attentive. He ensured we never ran out of water and stayed hydrated, which sounds simple but so many restaurants get this wrong. So compliments to the waiters.

Last but not least, unlike other restaurants that penalize you for paying with credit cards, Barn Joo chose an innovative approach and gave us a 10% discount for paying in cash. Other restaurants that do something similar usually just cover the tax. Barn Joo went a step further which I really appreciate.

If you're in the area, definitely worth checking out. Also, if you are interested in more foodie adventures, follow me on Instagram at @dailymealhabits",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

I have been to another location 2 years go in union square and I liked it better. This one is smaller and the staff is not that polite and friendly. Very straight face and just like wanna get the customer order. I didn't feel welcomed there. The food is mediocre and didn't taste anything I had before in the Union Square location . Btw, this location is at 35 street and 6 th ave. I only liked the jalapeño margarita.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Barn Joo 35 is just a short drive from Times Square, and well worth it. We stopped in on a Tuesday night and the house was packed. We're not very familiar with Korean food so we asked our waiter for suggestions. He suggested the appetizer Chili Shrimp-which was amazing. It had a light crunch, the shrimp was fresh and it was sitting in a mildly spicy sauce. We also had the pork dumplings which were a little better than ok. For our main dish, we had the Hotstone Bowl with Bulgogi, brown rice, veggies and a different mildly spicy sauce. Delish! All of the above was paired with great service. I see why Barn Joo 35 has great reviews.

Barn Joo 35,"A very unique twist on Korean tapas!

Came during happy hour and ordered drinks, fries and their wings and it was great!

Also got their kimchi cream udon which was absolutely delicious as well as their fire chicken fondue and creamy truffle rice cake.

The only thing I wouldn't order again is the chicken fondue. I mean the flavors were great but the cheese was a fail, tasted too gritty and it seemed like it started out as a roux and then just threw some cheese on. But that's just my opinion.

Other then that, all of the other food tasted great accompanied with an iced cold beer.

Would definitely recommend!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"I came by on a busy Friday night. Most other places were packed but there was space for our party here. The place is 3 floors so there's lots of room but come before 7pm on a Friday if you don't want to wait long.

Crunchy Tofu: very crispy, spicy, portion seemed smaller than the Union Square location.

Roasted Vegetables: heavy truffle seasoning, average.

Softshell Crab: 1 whole crab, crunchy breading similar to ""fry"" japanese style. Pico de Gallo and tartar truffle sauce was pretty good.

Galbi Buns: everyone agreed that these were not galbi. It had the consistency closer to a burger/sausage than galbi. The flavor did not taste like galbi sauce either. Least favorite of the night.

BBQ chicken: relatively large portion. Flavor was average and nothing special though.

Seafood pancake: I've had pajuns in dozens of places. This is probably one of the worst I've had and it was tiny.

Spicy pork hot stone bowl: large portion. I was told it was good.

I've been to the Union Square location and unfortunately this location just doesn't measure up. The portions seem smaller and the food quality is not as good. It's a good backup option in K-town but definitely not my first choice.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

Barn Joo 35,"I have been told millions of times that NYC is a cultural melting pot, embracing all kinds of people from different cultural backgrounds. One of the most important aspects of culture is food culture, which I also believe is most tangible and helpful to people to have a first impression on an unfamiliar culture. Here in Barn Joo 35, I felt so lucky to get to know Korean cuisines in such an unforgettable and pleasant way.

Uni bibimbap(highly recommend): it brings you a taste of sea and mountains. Topped with fresh colorful veggies, it amazed me at the first sight! Together with seaweed, salmon roe and sea urchin, a special savory multi-layers taste made me think: where am I? Maybe in jeju island?

Bulgogi(highly recommend): you heard hissing sound as soon as you mixed everything up in the hotstone bowl. The smell of barbecued meat and brown rice whetted my appetite instantly! The highlight was a sunny egg on top. After throughly stirring up, any grain of rice was washed with yolk, my favorite combination!

Crunchy tofu and charred chicken: tofu tasted really like its name--crunchy! A melody of deliciousness! We actually wanted some fried chicken but the cheese chicken cooked tender and tasty too.

Tip: check in to get free cocktail shot! We tried lichee and aloe before our meal, just to quench our thirst.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Perfect spot for late night cravings. I love Korean fusion so when I saw the high ratings, I had to check it out. Try to put yourself on the waitlist through Yelp-- went around 9 pm and had to wait ~15-20 mins. It seemed to be constantly busy in there.

Started off with two appetizers, the crunchy tofu and pork belly nachos. Highly recommend both! I got the eel stone pot and my bf got the bulgogi one. We both think they were delicious. Ate it so quick I burned my tongue! Portions are smaller than expected but it was just the right amount of food for me. Paid around $70 for all of this. Btw, you get 10% off if you pay in cash.

The japchae and the tiger roll are so satisfying and accessible for anyone regardless of if you are a spice fiend like me or not. Pair it with great service and it's a really pleasant and delicious experience.

Sure, it's a loud and cramped little space -- but don't let that deter you. I've had two intimate and fun dates with my boyfriend here, marveling over the food and atmosphere, and we've decided it's our favorite food spot in NYC.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Was pretty disappointed in this spot given its great Yelp ratings. I ordered a few items and rated them out of 5 stars:

Tuna Mayo: 3.5 stars. Good, not great. I would have liked the mayo to have been more of an aioli rather than just straight mayo to make a poke/tuna salad mashup. I also thought the tuna was diced too small so it's natural flavor didn't stand out as much. But I loved the sweet drizzle of honey on the bread.

Soft shell Crab: 1 star. The panko crust was so thick and overwhelming that I didn't get any sense of what I was eating aside from fried batter. Not pleasant.

NY Bites: 3 stars. The meat and potatoes were cooked perfectly, but something just felt odd about the soy-based marinade. Too much sweetness fighting against the umami. This dish went unfinished.

Bread Pudding: 3.5 stars. It's not a super moist bread pudding, but the ice cream on top more ham makes up for it. The almond streusel on top was good but felt like a little too much at times. Overall, a good, not-too-sweet dessert.

Service was decent, although I had to wait about 30 minutes for the bread pudding--I think the waitress forgot for a while.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Had dinner here with friends and associates while attending a conference in Manhattan. Lively spot with nicely done Korean dishes. Had Kimchi pancake and hot stone bibimbap bowl with bulgogi beef. Enjoyed every delicious bite! Service was friendly and expedient. With six in our group, twenty percent gratuity was automatically added to our bill. We each needed to pay separately, so we asked for the bill to be split. Our waiter told us he could only run four credit cards for one check. Fortunately, a couple of us had enough cash on us.

The tuna mayo, garlic soy wings, and volcano eggs are definitely must-try's!! We were in a bit of a time crunch, but our waiter (Jun) was awesome at getting us seated, fed, and out in record time.

We'll definitely come back when we have more time to enjoy the food. I want to try everything on their menu!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Came here with my boyfriend and his mother and really loved the atmosphere!! I love the wood, trees, and lit up moon that really creates a nice environment for a good meal.
However, the food was pretty middle of the road. We got a lot of things to split for the table.
Bulgogi Hotstone Bowl - eh, this was just okay. Bulgogi is my favorite, I always try to get it when it's on the menu. This was probably the  most ""meh"" bulgogi I've ever gotten.
Truffle fries - good, but nothing exciting. The fries have a ""truffle essence"" on them that definitely comes through flavor wise. They're not bland, just not great.
Pork dumplings with soy garlic - this was probably our fault. There are two options for sauces and we went with the nonspicy one. However, I assumed that it would be a dipping sauce where it was actually cooked on the dumpling. They were good, just not what I was expecting.
Chili shrimp with sweet and spicy chili sauce - one of the best things of the night! Perfectly breaded, nice and crispy, with a hint of heat from the sauce.
Popcorn chicken with BBQ sriracha sauce - another one of my favorites. Very simple, but the portion is HUGE.
Wings with soy garlic - delicious and crispy! Very, very good.
Galbi bao buns - the absolute biggest disappointment of the night. Bao buns were *the reason* I was excited to eat here, and I didn't even finish half of one. It tasted like a more dry puck of a burger. 0/10
To drink: ginger lemonades. Nice and refreshing!

All in all, I really loved the ambiance. (Although I haven't mentioned it, the tables were pretty close to one another. I can see how when it gets busy you can potentially be rubbing elbows with the table behind you.) The food was pretty good, but for the price of everything, I won't think very worth it.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

Flavor but again not great. Wouldn't rush to go back but would say if your in the mood for Americanized Korean food you will love this place",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"So far I've been to barn joo three times. The first time 3/4 dishes were GREAT (tofu, mushroom bibimbap, and fries - japchae was eh). Attempt number two was less of a success. BUT they redeemed themselves on trip number three.

Some positives:  
-vegan and non-vegan options
-yelp wait list (so I've never waited long)
-incredible mushroom bibimbap: great flavors and super crispy rice

The time that was not so great:
-They put an egg in my bibimbap after I requested it be vegan. They then brought out free fries, but they were kind of burnt and very oily (the first time I got them they were good thkugh). When they finally brought out the bibimbap again, the rice wasn't crispy at all -_- I think because they rushed. Half of the reason I love that dish is because of the crispy rice, so this was greatly disappointing.
-I always order this raw  veggie bowl (with lettuce and peppers and etc.) And they have a pepper in there that is hot as f*ck, but it just looks like one of those non-spicy korean peppers, so you bite into it and it really messes you up. It's bad. I really think they should warn you when they bring it, but they never do. It's 'mouth burning I need milk' hot, so not cool in my opinion.

Anyway other than the above, I like this place and will keep coming back.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Been here many times as they have a nicely catered happy hour menu that I like to go with friends on a Thursday/Friday after work.
Truffle Fries - standard truffle fries you get around the city, really flavorful
Truffle Rice Cake & Cheese - really rich with the cheese and loved the touch of corn on it
Crunchy Tofu - this was really nice and delicate and having the caramelized Kimchi was a nice touch
Wings - got the soy garlic and they were amazing, something I would definitely get again. Wings were savory and had a nice crunch to it
Calamari & Nuts - didn't know what to expect from a wasabi buttermilk battered calamari but it was definitely something I enjoyed. It had a nice kick to it while maintaining the integrity of the calamari to not be overpowering, finished with roasted peanuts complimented it nicely as well",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Bathroom 2, Food 5

The bathroom is small. Nothing is automatic. It's decor is nice and if you're Elon Musk you can enjoy the anatomy of the moon in full 2k resolution while you release your bodily fluids. If you find alphonsus before you finish you win the game. Theres only 1 bathroom so there is a little bit of a wait as well.

The food is excellent. You dont go in expecting anything. You go in expecting anju and a few drinks  and it exceeds the expectations so it gets a 5. It's a little pricey for simple korean tapas but everything is pricey in k-town. The service is amazing too so 1+ to the team.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

Bulgogi bimbimbop
Pork fried dumplings
Crispy chicken buns
Soft crab shell
Banana pudding

Cons:
waited about 35 mins even after checking in/on the yelp waitlist
felt a bit cramped
Small tables and basic not so comfy chairs",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Great food, yummy appetizers.
We sat at the bar and had this spicy jalapeño drink, that burned so good. This is a busy restaurant so make reservations early. We didn't and since we didn't have the time to wait, we opted to sit at the bar where the drinks were promptly delivered and the bartenders were kind and informative.

This review is for the bar.

Usually bars can be hectic, bartenders are often distracted, running back and forth - helter skelter. Not the case here. Our bartender was very personable, walked us through the bar bites and bar menu. Made suggestions for drinks and made sure we were satisfied, he seemed ready to switch something out if we looked disappointed. He must have read us well because every suggestion he made was on point.

I can't remember the food. Lets just leave it at that. Good thing we walked. Don't drink and drive!

I would definitely come back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,Been dying to come to this place and so happy we did. Came here for pre concert dinner and caught happy hour. Drinks still 14 dollars but I was still happy after 3 drinks . Place is so hip and chic playing great club music and has a fantastic menu. We went for the tapas.  Ordered so many different ones I can't comment on all of them but wow one better then the others. Dumplings best i ever had. Fried ones are more like empanadas. Omg tacos insane. Pork belly buns oh my. Soy garlic wings ffffing amazing they like crack. Fish buns wow so much flavor chicken buns just as good. There's nothing on menu not good. I should of waited till morning to do this review i am a bottle of Tito's deep right now.  Ended the night with churros that we're to die for with chocolate lava that was sinful.   Place is always packed and have  tiny chairs and it's loud as f... but dam worth it for what they have.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Went last week for a quick bite after a work social and put our name on the wait list and 2 out of 3 of us were there but they would not seat us until the full party which is fine if the restaurant was busy but why they could not seat us when the restaurant had a few open tables? I would have given them 4 stars but because of them not willing to adjust their policy, I downgraded it by a star. We ordered the Japjae, soft shell crab and a sushi roll. I didn't try the sushi, but the noodles and crab were pretty good.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"I enjoyed Barn Joo the 2/3 times I've been there but the third trip totally put me off. A really big peeve of mine is when restaurants don't adhere to the time they advertise not only on yelp & google (which I can understand might not be updated/accurate) but even on their own website. I'm from out of town and was really excited to come here with my friend (would've been her first time here) as our first stop to eat. We arrived to the restaurant on Thursday night at 10:45pm. Their menu says they close at midnight on Thursdays. However the door was locked and even though there were still people eating inside, the staff just shook their head at us and signaled they were closed. I think this is way too early  especially when they should be open for over another hour and there are still patrons dining and wanting to come in. At most, we would've just settled for a couple drinks at the bar if the kitchen was closed.

Overall I'm giving it 3 stars based on my decent experience here in the past but not sure I would risk coming here late at night to be turned away again",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Such a cute spot! I love Asian Fusion to begin with, and this place definitely does it right. The menu covers every Korean Fusion craving you could want. Service was mediocre and there's almost always a line, but the food is worth the wait!

We ordered the Truffle Fries, Wings in garlic soy, Sashimi Salad, and Spicy Pork with a side of rice. I highly recommend the fries and wings - perfectly seasoned and so flavorful. The sashimi salad was mediocre, as it was a bit oily and not extremely refreshing like I'd expect. The spicy pork was good, but a bit overpriced. I felt like I could've gotten the same thing (or better) at a more traditional Korean restaurant. With that being said, I primarily came to Barn Joo for the fun, lively ambiance so I'm not complaining!

Overall, a great place for dinner and drinks. Highly recommend!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"The perfect place if you like variety and Korean food. With so many options for Tapas, you can sample things to your heart's desire. Personally, I love variety and tasting just a bit of a lot of dishes, so I loved this place.

I tried the soy garlic wings, chili shrimp, crunchy tofu, and fried tiger roll. The soy garlic wings were great. The sweet and savory sauce coating these sticky wings had the Korean flavors I was craving for. The wings also maintained their crunchiness really well despite being thoroughly covered in sauce. The chili shrimp was a delight providing a great light and crispy texture with a juicy shrimp in the middle. It paired well with the sweet chili sauce. The crunchy tofu was honestly not my favorite, but it was alright. This dish used hard tofu, but I usually like soft tofu (although it is harder to make) because it provides a more delicate dish and has a better contrast of textures. It was also not very crunchy as the fried layer had already become soggy and chewy. The fried tiger roll was really good. It was like tiger roll from a sushi restaurant, but was thick like kimbap.

Overall great place for Korean food and massive variety. One of the most unique Korean restaurants I've been to and highly recommend trying it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"This is another super cute korean place with a twist a couple steps from the k-town area. The dinner crowd was incredibly busy when we got there, but they can text you when a table is ready or you can join the yelp waitlist. When the weather is nice there are a couple benches outside to wait at. The place is two floors with tables packed in pretty tight.

We got the tuna mayo, which was refreshing on little baguette pieces. The truffle fries were a common app to get among everyone with the strong truffle aroma, the crispness of the fries, and the spicy mayo that it came with was bomb. The bulgolgi was another good dish to get. Super tender meat with onions and we got a side of rice with it.

For cocktails, we got a bottle of the purple rain soju cocktail which was probably the best decision ever. One bottle probably gave us six drinks, which is a good value vs getting the drinks separately which would have been $7 a drink vs $32 a bottle. I've discovered my love for soju. The grape definitely covers any real fast of alcohol and although the drink is strong, it's super easy to drink. Definitely a problem haha.

Definitely a go back, although next time I might try lunch or a later hour for a quicker seat.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Based on this place's great ratings, I was thoroughly unimpressed by the food and service. We came around 6PM on a Tuesday night and there was plenty of seating upstairs but the hostess tried seating us at a small table right by the entrance where it was crowded and cold... I had to ask to sit elsewhere. The service during the actual meal was fine.

I'm a big tapas fan so we ordered a number of small dishes to share. For the most part, the dishes were bland or the flavors were severely undistributed. Very underwhelming meal despite all the hype.

Chili Shrimp: Our favorite of the apps. Fried shrimp in a yummy sauce. There were four shrimp.

Nacho Belly: This was basically KBBQ on some tortilla chips. The soybean paste and salad added all the flavor. Not very imaginative.

Volcano Egg: They make it sound fancy but it's just steamed egg pudding with roe and it was incredibly bland. They didn't add any salt and it tasted like mush. The sides were burnt and it was all around horrible. Do not order.

Truffle Rice Cake & Cheese: We ordered this to make up for the volcano egg but this was disappointing too. It was super cheesy and had a strong truffle smell but had a gritty texture like boxed mac n' cheese. All the flavor was on the outside and the actual rice cake had no taste. Also would not recommend.

The one thing this place has going for it is the price. Also I was afraid of smelling like KBBQ after the meal but the smell wasn't strong at all.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to have dinner before heading to the Top of the Rock observatory while we were in NYC. This place happened to be conveniently nearby so we thought we'd give it a try.

First thing I noticed was that it was small but so as every other restaurant here. They were busy at the time but we only waited about 10 mins. We were seated upstairs and immediately greeted by our server. We ordered the wings in garlic soy sauce, fries, and bulgogi (main) with a side of white rice. Everything was delicious. I loved the wings I wish we ordered more. The bulgogi was tender and savory. The fries were soft yet crispy, served with spicy mayo and ketchup. The portions are pretty good too. We also got the soju cocktail flight and I thought it was pretty cool. My favorite has to be the apple flavored one.

I usually take pictures before eating but I was so hungry and the food looked so good I couldn't resist!

Our server was also pretty cool. He was nice and attentive even though he's serving all tables upstairs. The place was small but has good amount of seats. I can't explain the vibe but this would the place I'd love to visit after a long day at school with friends or a long fun filled day with family.

I really enjoyed this place. I hope they have it in the west coast!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,Came for their happy hour oysters and wings after 4pm. Pricing is not bad but wish they can have more options of snacks/food for their happy hour menu. The wings were really good - we got the soy garlic. The oysters were okayy for $1 each. The sushi is 4 pieces for $8-9 or something and I thought that was overly priced...but I did like their truffle fries!

Came here on a Friday night at around 8 and the wait for 2 was about 30 min, which was pretty short compared to other spots nearby. We waited at the bar, where we tried the aloe soju shots. Pretty tasty!

For food, we ordered the fried asparagus, bugolgi beef with veggie wraps and the fried tiger roll, all of which was really yummy! We split a bottle of yuzu soju as well. I liked the idea of Korean tapas and the menu items were definitely unique!

Overall, I had a great experience here and would definitely come back to try other items on the menu. The prices weren't too bad for NYC either!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"I came here with for dinner with my friend a few days ago and I loved it!!!

We ordered the eel bibimbap, truffle fries, and the fire chicken fondue (which was one of the specials for the day). All of them were delicious!! The decor and overall aesthetic were really nice and I would describe it as quite trendy. It was pretty busy when we went, so we put our names on the waitlist through yelp and shopped around in the area while we waited. The service overall was pretty good, in my opinion, especially considering how busy it was. I really enjoyed the food and general vibe of this place and I'd definitely like to go again and try some new menu items.

I recommend making a reservation/joining the waitlist on yelp before arriving to avoid long wait times, but I do think the food was very good and that it is definitely a good place to try out!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"3.25/5 - Overall, a decent meal but not a place I would return to or recommend to a friend.

The food ranged from good to fairly tasty, but serving sizes were tiny (even for tapas/small plates) and all uninspiring. The staff felt stretched thin - our water glasses were left empty unless you actively flagged someone down (easier said than done given how loud and crowded the restaurant was). The space was also made for a very uncomfortable dining experience. We sat at one of the high tables near the bar in the back, and the bar patrons kept bumping into our table. It's hard to enjoy a meal when there's someone's back constantly inches away from your food and loud shouting back and forth from all around. For a relatively narrow restaurant, why is there even a bar in the back?

My fiancé and I ordered a bunch of small dishes to share, as well as the clam and mussels hot pot ($28). Out of the small dishes, we tried the tuna mayo, fried tiger roll, and shrimp tempura roll - all $9 each. I guess this price was fair, but each dish seemed like a miniature of itself. Each ""roll"" only came with 4 pieces, which doesn't make sense for sharing with larger groups. The same sentiment can be applied to the tuna mayo dish, which had a few tiny pieces of baguette thins and just a small clump of tuna.

I can't see this restaurant being a good place for a casual date night, nor a big group of friends. Hard pass.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"The Bulgogi Hotstone bowl comes out sizzling hot and full of flavor with sautéed veggies, crispy quinoa, rice, and a perfect egg yolk on top.  The gopchang sauce it comes with adds a really nice kick.

Barn Joo 35,"My boyfriend and I have come here several times, both the atmosphere and the food have been great every time we've came.
There is usually a wait but the last time we were here we joined the waitlist (via yelp!) and that really did help minimize the wait time.

When we come we always get the fried chicken (bc if you're not getting KFC in Ktown what are you doing), the chicken is always flavorful and crispy so A+
We also did the barbecue last time and it was good, a little pricy but the meat was pretty good quality.
There were several other things that we ordered but they escape me atm.
For dessert we got the churros and giiiirl, its legit.

Anyways, will probably come again, but this location is small so try to make a ressie if you're planning on coming during rush hours.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Well there goes my paycheck! Barn Joo 35 is very pricey even during happy hour so consider carefully before you come. We came around 6 PM on a weekday and made it in time for happy hour (4 PM - 7 PM). The restaurant was really packed but they were able to find us a table in the back. I could immediately tell that this was a high-end restaurant. The fancy decor and candles on every table added to its ambiance.

We started off with two drinks from the happy hour menu. There were only three options for cocktails so we went with the A-Thyme, which contains soju, and the Bee-line, which contains vodka and has a strong lavender honey flavor. The drinks were pretty good but the waiters had brought our drinks to the wrong table so they took forever to get to us.

[ Bibimbap Mushroom Hot Pot ] Keep in mind that you must order a minimum of two servings. The waiter set up a small portable hot pot on our table. I found the hot pot flavor to be pretty bland. They were very stingy with the beef and I found everything else to be pretty unimpressive.

[ Oysters ] $1 per oyster during happy hour! This was probably the only redeeming part of the meal. The oysters were fresh and juicy! I would highly recommend.

Between two people, our meal came out to be around $100!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

Barn Joo 35,"Food here is good: Tasty and not overpowered with flavors. However, the portions are small for the price.

NY bites (not vegetarian), was good, our family enjoyed it.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Barn Joo is a fantastic place if you're looking for unique Korean Fusion food and if you're looking for tasty tapas. They've got great Happy Hour specials between 4-6 pm. I've come here a few times and ordered different things, but all of the things I've gotten are always delicious. My fiancé always suggests Barn Joo because he loves the truffle fries. My personal favorites is the Nacho Belly and the soft shell crab. Last time I also had the fisherman's stew and it was absolutely delicious.

Barn Joo is definitely not a traditional Korean restaurant so don't come expecting your banchan, even though they do have som bibimbap and other dishes.

Still tasty, but bc of the sauce. The seafood noodles were really yummy, had a lot of flavor and didn't skimp on seafood. My friend's bulgogi luttuce wrap was really good and big portion.

I really enjoyed the calamari- that was spiced and with peanuts. I also had the galbi buns and tiger roll. The food is savory and I eat it right away but I always have to really ponder about what I ate after because though the items are enjoyable- I don't feel full enough after eating them.

I started with a glass of prosecco and had the crispy chicken on bao buns. It was great! Crunchy chicken with some spice and sweet in the sauce on top of fluffy, tender bao buns. It came with a side of truffle fries and they were hot out of the fryer with a heavy salt and truffle.

I liked the menu and saw many options that looked great. I'd definitely visit again!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

The pork belly nachos were literally 5 chips and three pieces of pork belly for $16. For $80, I was left unsatisfied and thinking ""meh"".

Skip this place.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Meh. Overrated for sure and did not have a good experience the minute we walked in. The woman who sat us was rude and obnoxious. We came on a weekday at 4pm. This place had only ONE table. She asked us how many. It was just me and another girlfriend who was also Asian, and a third friend who might or might not join us so I told her 3 just in case. She told me she couldn't seat us until everyone was here. Like are you kidding me? This place was empty and the only table that happened to be there at the time was occupied by two white men in a table that sits 4. Why the difference in treatment? I told her to just sit us first because the friend might not even join us. She snapped back and said very rudely to us that we couldn't switch to a bigger table later and if we really needed to we would have to talk to a ""administrator"". Damn wow. Didn't know things were this serious.

We came here specifically for the happy hour and did not find much of drink options or discount on the drinks. They do have a few options for food on the happy hour menu including the wings and the truffle fries. Truffle fries were pretty good and crispy and the wings were a dollar each and pretty flavorful.

The service from other staffs were actually fine. The third friend couldn't make it at the end that night so we did not have to get the ""administrator"" to come and switch our seats.

Overall, lack of happy hour drink options, and rude service from the hostess/waitress, won't be returning to this one. There are plenty of other Korean fried chicken places in the city",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"We made a reservation for 5 people at 6pm today.
When we arrived we were seated and the hostess was nice. Once we sat down, the waitress (I believe her name is kelly cause that's what it says on the bill) asked us what we would like to drink and we said hot water and she nodded her head and rolled her eyes and walked away. When she came back with the hot water, we said thank you and she didn't even acknowledge us or said you're welcome and just walked away again and kept rolling her eyes. It was so obvious that she was bothered by something or unhappy about something (I'm really not sure what because we were polite and literally just sat down). Then when her coworker came, it was obvious she started talking about our table cause they kept looking at us and it made me feel really uncomfortable to be in this kind of environment. I just wanted to come and enjoy a good dinner with my friends. It saddens me that I have to leave a one star review for this establishment due to the fact that the worker was nasty and disrespectful. Also I asked the girl why does it say 20% tip and she said we ""HAD TO"" pay it. And okay we did
Just warning everyone else to be careful when coming to this business because the waitress was rude and the workers are talking about you right in front of your face and then you end up having to put a 20% tip for shitty service.
If you want to be treated like a human being, don't come here!

Barn Joo 35,"First off, this place was busy. I mean like the good kind of busy where if NYC locals will wait outside to eat here, it must be worth it. I made a reservation so I really only waited 10 min to get a table. Unsure how the normal walk-in wait is. Started with fried chicken dumpling which almost looked like empanadas. It was savory and the chicken inside was juicy. A light sauce was on the outside with almost a subtle sweetness to it. The entrees arrived next. One of the other guests devoured as much of the seafood ramen as she could. I didn't taste it personally because it's seafood, but her silence (normally she talks your ear off) indicated to me that she was enjoying her meal. I ordered the bulgogi hot stone dish with brown rice. The rice and beef were already mixed together in the hot bowl. Beef was cooked well done but not tough in the slightest; very tender. There was an orange-red sauce that almost looked like ketchup. Unsure what the sauce was but was very mild in flavor and it added a level of sweetness to balance the salt in the dish. Halfway through the entree, our two orders of pork buns came. Thankfully I didn't eat too much so I had room still for this. The bun had a spongy airy texture. Inside was the succulent pork that melted in your mouth. Most likely, the pork was slow cooked. Only complaint is that the appetizers should come before the meal. Not an issue to lose a star but more of an ideal scenario. A cool surprise was that I got a free shot of the house cocktail for checking in to Yelp. Tasted like lichi juice, southern comfort, and coconut rum. Have no idea what it was, but a full glass of it would likely get me tipsy. The hostess seemed to keep her cool with the amount of people piling in, so kiddos to her. Our server was slightly timid, but attentive. She got everything in our order correct as well. Overall, a great dining experience.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

Barn Joo 35,"Amazing food but the service was bad. Front hostess area and the actual server were both rude AF. The waiter was in his phone most of our dinner and I had to get up outta my seat to actually get his attention 3 times, not just once. Really good food but not that good that I would go back. Favorite dish was the KFC and the spicy pork",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Even if I were to put on my ""This is Korean Fusion Food"" cap, this place is a fail. I got enticed by the great Yelp rating, but I knew as soon as I walked in and saw very few Koreans there that it would not be good Korean food.

First, the disposable chopsticks they give you are super cute. They're a deeper brown color and def more fancy-looking than at your typical Korean restaurant. I know you don't care, but I noticed and wished I could take some home. :)

Second, the food is just not yummy. Let's just get that out there. If you are looking for delicious Korean food, this place is not it - go 3 streets down to 32nd and go to a real Korean restaurant. This place is where you go when you want small, expensive portions to nosh on while you catch up with a friend who doesn't know food. Literally, not one single dish we ordered was something I'd classify as tasty Korean food. Actually, not one single dish we ordered was something I'd classify as tasty food, period. It was just all mediocre and underseasoned and honestly, expensive for what it was given that the portions are more reminiscent of tapas than anything else.

Vegetable Japchae: $16. People, this is not how good japchae is supposed to taste, I'm sorry. At the very least, it needs more seasoning.  

Crunchy Tofu: $9. My non-Korean friend who still knew enough about Korean food to know the food was off described this dish as basically fried tofu in General Tso sauce. And yeah. That's basically what this is. Too sweet, tofu not seasoned inside, did not enjoy. If you like General Tso chicken, maybe you can try it....it wasn't disgusting or anything - just not a flavor/texture I enjoy.

Bulgogi: $18. Small portion. Probably the best dish we ordered that night, but this is not saying much given how disappointing everything else was. On a bulgogi scale of 1-10, 10 being the best ever, it was probably a 6. Not bad, but not great. If I HAD to come to this restaurant again, this is the only thing I'd order again.

Seafood Pancake. $14...for maybe a 6"" diameter pancake with minimal seafood. Oh. And salt? This pancake was allergic to it. I mean - LITERALLY there was no salt in this at all. The pancake was greasy, crispy on the outside but oddly wet and sticky on the inside...I've never had a less delicious seafood pancake in my life, and I've had thousands in my life. Do not recommend.

Overall, I do not recommend this restaurant. It's 2 stars b/c I reserve 1 star reviews for restaurants where the food is inedible, which this wasn't. I just don't think it's a good representation of Korean cuisine, and I think the focus of this restaurant is more on the atmosphere/branding/look/hype/experience/presentation than the actual food. And this fat girl is all about the food, man. And the food just does not deliver. I can't be tricked into thinking I ate something delicious with fancy disposable chopsticks.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Came here for lunch and ordered the Tuna mayo, Crispy chicken buns and Farmer's meal w/ galbi. I believe the farmer's meal is only available during lunch.
The tuna mayo was good but felt like I can get this dish at any Japanese/Korean restaurant that has tuna tartare. It was good but nothing unique about this.
Crispy chicken buns was exceptional. Basically a pork belly bun with crispy chicken.  Chicken was indeed crispy when it was served. Sauce was tangy and spicy.
Farmer's meal was really good as well. Came with brown quinoa rice. Very healthy and slightly dry if eaten by itself. I made myself a wrap with the lettuce and assortments of veggies. Galbi was very tender and flavorful. A must get.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Review for happy hour only.

Excellent happy hour specials. Korean fried chicken wings are only $1! The decent size, crispy and flavor packed makes it a top KFC place in my books. You can't go wrong with getting a bunch of these for the table. Get a side of truffle fries, or fried tofu with the wings.

Drink specials are good too. Soju cocktails are tasty and creative and dangerous because soju. Comes with ice as a lollipop. There's a good grape flavored one but they're honestly all good.

Definitely recommend for happy hour. Just wish it was a little longer than 4-6! Oh well. I'll take what I can get.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

It was super filling, service was fast, and amazingly delicious. Like wow. So incredible. The rice cakes were a really strange texture because the rice balls felt kind of goo-ey, but honestly it was really good. Popcorn chicken was good too, but nothing unusual. The bowls were amazing! Full of lots of different flavors, and it comes right in the pan that they cook it in, so it stays hot the whole time. 100% would come back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

And my momma and grandmother fry some mean chicken but the Koreans KILLEDDDD THIS DISH!! The garlic tofu wings wings were wangssss! We also had the shrimp tempura and that was very tasty. Then we embarked on the Bulgogi with white rice... AMAZING!! The service was also unforgettable. We will be back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,Came here for happy hour and ordered the truffle fries and wings. The truffle fries permeated the room with its smell but truthfully the taste was missing the mark. The fries just tasted like fries. The wings were cooked to a crusty exterior but the flavors were not quite there.

Barn Joo 35,"The Good:
This vibe was great. Packed, fun, nice decor.

The Not as Good: the food
We ordered a couple different things from the menu. The calamari was the best dish we had. We tried all 3 types of tacos... but each underwhelmed flavor wise. The sashimi ceviche was not what we excepted... the kimichi flavor overpowered the entire dish, absolutely crushing any other flavor notes.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

Barn Joo 35,"awww heck yeah!!

So excited to have found this spot - it's a little quieter than being in the heart of k-town but delivers all the great flavors of Korean food with some twists.

Highly recommend the kalguksu (seafood noodle soup), which is hearty, delicious, and enough to share. Brings back memories of Arirang before they closed! The farmer's meal with Kalbi is also excellent, and comes with a variety of traditional ssam/wrap options, including red leaf lettuce, shiso, etc. And mmm that kalbi, tastes just like home with a great marinade and smoky flavor.

Service is excellent from start to finish - even the way they package and bag leftovers is wonderful!

The only minuscule downside is that the tables are kinda small, but they make up for it by providing some breathing rooms between them (relatively speaking for NYC)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,This place is dope.  I come here all the time!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"The meal was really good! We listened to a review that said that the portions were too small and honestly...that wasn't true. The portions were pretty average sized so three dishes were a bit too much for three people to share (side dishes included). We ordered the seafood japchae, omurice, and hot stone bulgogi.

Japchae: Loved it! My favorite of the whole meal! Noodles were really flavorful & even if you got it without the seafood (which cost extra) it's still really good. I think it came with a side of truffle fries which had a pretty strong truffle flavor. Truffley. As it should be.

Hot stone bulgogi: A lot of meat! It will definitely meat your expectations. Actually maybe even too much meat to rice ratio. But that's okay cuz the rice got crispy which is brilliant with the sweet meat.  

Omurice: Definitely would not order again. It just wasn't my taste and the salad that came with it was wayyyy too salty (I have a rule that my food can't be saltier than me). That's probably the reason why this is 4 stars.

Overall: It's a good place to eat Korean fusion food & the flavors are there! Plus, if you pay in cash, they'll give you 10% off.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Went to Herald Square to check out the Christmas decorations at Macy's. Looked on Yelp for some dinner suggestions. Saw great reviews here and a HUGE plus is they have Yelp Waitlist. Whaaaaa? I didn't even know that existed! It tells you how long the wait would be, how many people are in front of you, and updates real time. Boy am I glad I added my name to the waitlist while I was at Macy's. It said it would be a 15-30 min wait on a Friday night, around 6:3pm. Got there, checked in with the hostess (it's my first time using this feature so wanted to make sure she knew I was there). Super glad I added my name to the waitlist. Probably had to wait 5 minutes or so for our table. It's a crowded area near the hostess stand so if there's a lot of people waiting, you'll end up having to wait outside.

Bathroom downstairs, 1st floor has a bunch of tables towards the right (tables are very close to each other and I imagine it being a pain to get in and out of your chair because there's 2 rows of tables right next to each other. 1st time here and we had the best table, a table on the 2nd floor! Yes, there's a 2nd floor! 1 row of tables of the left so you're not as squished as the people on the 1st floor. Whew! (plus my boyfriend is tall and has long legs so I don't think he'd enjoy sitting on the 1st floor). Went up the stairs and knew right away I'd love the place. They had the same picture that we have in our apartment (a large picture of Manhattan back in the 1960's)! It's a sign of a good time! Cute décor, there was a row of different sized/shape cutting boards on the wall behind our table.

Looked at the menu and wanted to order so many things! But there's only 2 of us, so I guess we'll just need to come back again to come try other stuff! We decided to share everything so we can order more variety. We got the bulgogi hot pot, galbi buns and Korean escargot. By far, my favorite was bulgogi hot pot!! Comes in a clay pot with some fire below it. Inside you'll find glass noodles, bulgogi, and veggies. So good, the broth made it! The broth was hearty, flavorful and so comforting, warms you up on the inside. I would literally take our leftover broth and bring it home to add more noodles to it! Lol. But I didn't. Thought about it though....

The galbi buns were good. Not what I imagined but still good. I imagined the galbi that I have at Korean BBQ (slice of galbi) but instead it was more of a hamburger form of galbi. The bun is fluffy and the same bun they use for peking duck at Chinese restaurants. The Korean escargot was just okay, comes with kimchi. The kimchi was good but wasn't wow-ed by the escargot. Felt like it was really chewy, or maybe I'm biased because I just had my wisdom tooth removed a few days ago so could only chew on one side.

Overall, excited I was able to find a new restaurant to try! And can't wait back to try other things on the menu that I saw, like seafood pancake or one of the hot stone pots!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"One of the best restaurants in New York City, and that says a lot! This is a Korean restaurant that served tapas which are smaller dishes. My boyfriend and I always overestimate ourselves and we always order way too many dishes but I'm glad we did with this place because every single dish was sooo delicious. One con is that this place is REALLY loud and the tables are pretty close together so don't go here if you're trying to have a real conversation. Their happy hour looks really good but we didn't try any drinks :( next time we will! Especially if you check in with Yelp, I think you get a free shot of soju. Everything was honestly so delicious; and one thing that really made the experience worth it was how nice the servers were.

Barn Joo 35,"This was my most favorite meal in my 4 day visit to New York! We came on a Friday for an early dinner before our Harry Potter and the Cursed Child show at Lyric Theatre. Word of warning - you aren't able to make a same day reservation, but since we arrived at 545, we were able to be seated pretty quickly.

We sat upstairs and had a few different servers that helped our table. The service was very efficient. We decided to go the tapas route and ordered the chili shrimp, crunchy tofu, roasted vegetables, rice cake w/cheese, and steamed veggie dumplings. Everything was excellent! I highly recommend the truffle rice cake with cheese!! It is basically a Korean twist on mac & cheese and was just delicious! Also, the roasted vegetables were sooo good with almost a granola like topping. I would also recommend that if you are to get any of the dumplings to go ahead and just get them fried. The steamed dumplings just weren't that exciting and fall apart so easily. We finished off our meal with the lava cake. Now, I am a fan of a hotter and more meltier chocolate center when it comes to a lava cake. I expect it to ooze out warm chocolate when I cut into it. This one was more like a warm ganache type center that stayed put. Don't get me wrong, though, it was still really good and the gelato used on top was amazing!

I would say this is a must check out restaurant in the area, just definitely have a reservation!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

The spicy pork was not at all spicy and I have had much much better spicy pork bowl at least in two restaurants in Philly which was actually spicy and flavorful. My friend liked the Fried Shrimp although I wasn't blown away by it. Tiger rolls were humongous but lacking in flavor.

We definitely enjoyed our first visit at Barn Joo 35. We felt like the tables were a bit cramped and it's very loud, but overall it was a nice experience.

Food:

- Crispy Chicken Buns (two pieces) $14: too heavy on the sauce but the buns were cooked perfectly and the crispy chicken was delicious. Perfect appetizer for one or two people. This happened to be my favorite dish that we ordered.

- Eel Hotstone Bowl $19: I was hoping to enjoy this dish more but it was pretty bland and tasteless. The eel itself was quite good with a nice flavor but there wasn't enough of it to make the dish taste anything more than a C+. I would order something else.

- Soft Shell Crab $10: decent portion for one person but not enough for two. One large lightly battered crab in a tasty sauce. I would order this again but not as a shareable.

The servers were incredibly friendly and consistent, always making sure we had everything we needed. We appreciate it and hope to visit again sometime soon!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

The appetizer was okay imo...the mix of raw fish with bread was a bit off (but i also might be biased because i don't like mayo LOL). The spicy pork bulgogi was pretty legit!! Tastes like my mom's hehe it comes with a bunch of veggies to make wraps. The wings were BOMB the skin was still crunchy even though it was dunked in sauce.

Barn Joo 35,"I want to give this place 5 stars so badly but given I am the self-proclaimed Korean food junkie, I just can't.  First off, this is fusion.  This isn't strictly Korean.  It is Korean fusion.  Which, while I can appreciate fusion, wasn't what I was hoping for.  I had big hopes for this place and in general, it did not disappoint.  

For a ""Korean gastropub"" the soju selection is shockingly limited.  The fact that the lettuce wrap and rice sets have to be purchased separately from your bulgogi or galbi order is also upsetting.  

That being said, the quality of the food was high.  The Korean escargot is definitely pushing this review higher for me.  It was so flavorful and cooked so well.  A little chewy but not overly so.  You could even disguise the escargot to a non-adventuresome diner as ""just like a mushroom!""  And the fruit/veggie kimchi that came with the escargot was a flavor I was hoping for - sharp, spicy, bright.  The japchae was solid but I won't lie when I say I can make a better one at home and being from NoVA have had much better.  The bulgogi was great!  It wasn't overly sweet and had a nice smokey flavor.  

The rest of our food was pretty average Korean food except for the rice cakes with cheese.  This was my favorite fusion aspect of the meal.  It was basically the creamiest/cheesiest mac n cheese you've ever had but with rice cakes instead of noodles.  I loved it!  All in all, I probably wouldn't rave too hard back home about this place.  Being so close to Annandale and having a severe obsession with Korean food, I wasn't overly impressed.  

The food quality was high, the ambiance was perfect for a rainy Saturday night in NYC and in general, the food was very approachable for a newbie (like some of my party was) to Korean food.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

Barn Joo 35,"FIRST THINGS FIRST:  Do not go by what the Yelp wait time says.  We showed up based on that and were told they no longer were taking tables that evening. We had made our way there based on the Yelp time.

After showing her my phone and explaining why we came all that way, and pointing out 3 empty tables, she agreed to seat us.

And we are glad she did.  It was probably THE BEST meal we had in NYC.  We got the pork hotstone bowls that hd an egg in them, soooooo freaking good.  They also offer prosecco which was a WIN-WIN!

Check out their instagram page for lots of pictures of good food and to help you decide what to order.  But don't rely on yelp's wait times, get a reservation instead.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"I really wanted to dislike my experience there since I have not had a positive experience pre-eating in the restaurant, but my meal was so good that I might actually come back. We were heading to a basketball game right afterward so we were only looking for a small snack. I called the restaurant and asked when their happy hour ended. The hostess said 6pm. So we got there a little bit before 6, and when we sat down, they did not give us the happy hour menu. We asked the hostess if we could get the menu and she said last call ended before then so they are not providing that menu. I get that various restaurants do last calls differently, but they should let you know when last calls are, not when happy hours end. With that, we were already there and hungry from the cold. We got a flight and the ribeye. The flight (purple rain, midtown, cucumber, and passionate) was okay--I should have just ordered the Midtown by itself. The ribeye was absolutely delicious--they bring it out to you on a cast iron and you cook it yourself. That was definitely the star of the night, and I would go back for it again.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

Barn Joo 35 ended up being that spot since we figure the smaller portions would allow us to try a couple of things without eating too much.

I put us on the Yelp waitlist on our way over, which turned out to be a good idea. A few minutes after arriving, we were seated at a table upstairs. We ordered Soy Garlic Chicken Wings and Galbi Buns.

The chicken wings came out almost immediately after ordering and were excellent. They were crunchy, sweet, and satisfying. We were off to a good start. The galbi buns were a huge disappointment. There was so much black pepper on it and it was all I could taste. The buns didn't seem fresh and the meat texture was not great. I expected more from a place with an overall 4.5* rating.

The food portions were great for just my friend and I and we still had to take to go bags.

Barn Joo 35,"I've been to the Barn Joo Union Square location before and even though it wasn't the best Korean restaurant I have ever had in New York, I heard much better reviews for the midtown location which was why I wanted to try and compare the two establishments.

I entered the restaurant with three other friends around 10:30 PM on a Friday night. Even though the restaurant appeared pretty packed, we were seated right away which I greatly appreciated.

The restaurant itself was pretty dark and had a glowing candlelight feel but was also very lively inside so it would be a great place to bring an early date.

For such a busy night, service was surprisingly quick and efficient. We were brought our menus and waters right away. And only had to wait for a bit before the server was back to take our orders. We ordered a bottle of soju, an order of the soft shell crab and a shrimp tempura roll for the table.

The soju was delicious, very smooth and sweet.

I am a giant fan of soft shell crabs so I was so excited to get a taste of it but it was honestly just ok. As soon as the crab was brought out there was just a smell that let you know the oil that the crab was fried in was not fresh, it had a very reused smell to it which did overpower the crab a little bit. Additionally, the crab was fried to a crisp so the panko crumbs and oil really overpowered the original taste of the crab. The tartare sauce was good, but made it feel like I was mostly eating fried breadcrumbs and sauce. And again like I was not appreciating the original taste of the crab.

As for the shrimp tempura roll, the flavor was pretty average. Nothing very amazing about it and honestly just tasted like a normal roll you could get at a supermarket.

All in all, even though the ambience and the liquor that was served was great, the food was kind of a disappointment which makes me uncertain whether or not I will be returning again.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

Also ordered following items off regular menu: Buns with fried chicken which was delish. Chicken was crunchy and bun very soft.

Order churro & icecream (requested dulce de leche instead of vanilla it comes with was very worth it). Delish. Churro abt gooey & icecream had so much flavor.

Ambience is cool & alil dark setting with small cute tables.

One waiter was very nice and polite. Another waiter was very rude, would forget to provide what we requested for, annoyed when we asked for menu and brought the wrong menu, wrongfully informed us they would charge extra for changing icecream flavor until we asked him to ask the chef who said no charge, didn't smile once (seemed annoyed the whole time).

Conclusion, HH is great and food delish! Svc is okay",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"My girlfriend has been watching a lot of videos by Maangchi lately, so she was very interested to check out Korean places in NYC. We decided on Barn Joo because of its high yelp ratings. But it was just... Meh :-/ might have something to do with the crazy busy service (we waited 30 mins) but it was pretty underwhelming.

Our drinks were pretty good. I'd give them 4 out of 5. We got two appetizers. The edamame was tasty: crunchy, sweet, spicy and full of umami. The escargots were slightly overcooked, although the kimchi side salad it came with was yummy! We got a volcano egg for our 3rd app. It wasn't good at all :( lacked seasoning, the bottom of the bowl was burnt, and there was too much fish roe. The gf didn't like this, and I had to finish it with the leftover sauce from the edamame. Finally the BIBIMBAP. Thankfully this was better, although nothing to write home about. Only thing is.. Salt was less. Yes, in this dish too.

Overall, this place isn't too costly, but the food isn't that special. Our recommendation: don't go by hype, go to some other Korean place if you want to get a taste of K-town.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"An Asian fusion tapas style restaurant. Most of the food items are Korean origin, but there's a pretty good assortment.

They have a happy hour menu from Monday to Friday 4-6pm. I was able to get the following:
Truffle Fries: $5 - Just your standard truffle fries you get pretty much anywhere. If you're craving fries, they won't disappoint. Don't expect it to be out of this world.

Crunchy Tofu: $7 - I would favor getting these over the fries just to try something new. Has a sweet coating on them which makes it taste good.

I also got a few other items that I'd recommend.
Soft Shell Crab: $10 - Wow...you get one piece, but it's one whole giant soft shall crab. Comes with tartar sauce which goes really well with the crab.

Fried Tiger Roll: $9 - Also exceeded what I would expected from this sort of restaurant. I'd eat the sushi without the soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi because the fish and sauce they put on the sushi is already enough for it to taste good.

The place can get packed and loud as the day goes on. The seating is pretty packed so entering and leaving your table is kind of a pain. The tables are small so we were having trouble fitting all of our meals on the table as more came out. Other than that, it was a pretty good experience.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Came here without a reservation on a Saturday night around 6pm and we had to wait about 10 minutes before getting seated. Around 6:30pm though, the line started getting long, so I'd recommend coming early to avoid a wait.

Fried Tiger Roll (5/5): comes in about 6 pieces and it was flavorful and fresh. Get this if you like sushi rolls with lots of sauce/ texture.

Bulgogi with vegetables (4/5): the bulgogi is pretty average, but nonetheless still good--just not ""wow."" The lettuce and veggies were fresh and clean.

Service is a bit slow, probably because of how packed the restaurant was. I think they're a bit understaffed (just a few waitstaff running around the entire place). Servers were very friendly though.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"My boyfriend wanted some bibimbap, so we stopped by. Everything looked good on yelp, and the food did not make us feel disappointed. The bulgogi stone bowl bibimbap tasted very good! We definitely love it. The uni bibimbap was not bad. The uni was not the best and freshest I have ever tested, but with its price, it's acceptable. We upgrade to the platter, and we love the sides came along. We will definitely stop by again and try different dishes.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,The clams and mussels were jumbo! Truffle fries is a must order! The spicy chicken tapas was flavourful and spicy. As for the cheesecake it was good but we felt it was overpriced because we couldn't taste the rice wine. It came with lots of fruits though.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"4/5 because

The food is pretty good and has a nice twist to the tradition dishes you find identical versions of everywhere

It's not amazing but is notable and delicious
Even though the bowl was so hot it roasted a little bit of my food (no big deal, just hotter than most hot stone bowls)

The place is clean - and modern looking
The milk bottles for water container was cute
Good seating area - but super crowded and tight
- easy to get over after a while to adjust

The service is pretty good for how hectic it looks
The price is more than what I thought it should be for what it is but nothing crazy or anything

Again; I ate the whole thing and wasn't left hungry, and it was a unique flavor too

I wouldn't change anything about the place really, though it might be a while before I want to go back there",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,Best meal when I was traveling in NYC.  The BBQ is fantastic and I had the best bread pudding I've ever had anywhere....I had no idea a Korean place could crank out a desert like that.  Yummmy!!!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,Unique atmosphere. Food was amazing. We just ordered a few tapas and they were so filling. The drinks are so creative and delicious. Happy we got to try this place.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"When it comes to Korean food, I'm a big fan of old school authentic and not the neo-Korean stuff that is starting to pop up.  Barn Joo is a happy medium - old Korean classics with a more modern take.  The decor here is great - modern and fun.

We came for lunch and got a couple of specials.  The wife had the hot stone bibimbap with BBQ chicken while I got the sashimi bibimbap.  We got the platter which came with soup, salad and dumplings (a good upgrade for $3).  The miso soup is excellent - chock full of umami and slightly spicy.  The salad was fresh and the dumplings were crispy and very tasty.  The sashimi bibimbap was really excellent - the fish was fresh and the rice perfectly seasoned and cooked.  Wife also gave a big thumbs up to her meal.

Service was prompt and excellent.  My only gripe was that the floor was a bit greasy and slippery which could be a hazard.  Other than that, this is a big thumbs up.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"I would honestly give this place 5 stars for most of the food but service is seriously lacking. We walked in with my parents for my mom's birthday and I told the host that we had a reservation for 6 people. He gave me an almost disgusted look and replied sharply, we don't take reservations so if you did it through yelp you're wrong and will have to wait and he walked away. I was shocked!! It was pouring rain outside and we had just walked in to be treated like garbage. I had literally called the day before and spoken to a lady at the restaurant who confirmed my reservation!! And even so, he could have talked to us like a normal human being! The restaurant was full but not extremely crowded. This really put a damper on the whole night. Thankfully, the other hosts and servers were much kinder and welcoming.

They have some great vegetarian and pescatarian options which we all really enjoyed. The veggie pancakes were very tasty as well as the crunchy tofu, fish buns and chili shrimp. The truffle Mac and cheese was also a wonderful fusion dish. I think there's something for everyone here and the drinks are also strong and well made. The winner of the show is the banana pudding for dessert. We tried each dessert and that was definitely the family favorite.

I have been to this restaurant 3 times now taking different groups of people. Not sure if I will return though because there is no need to be treated with disrespect.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"A fun place to visit if you want some Korean Tapas!
It's always so crowded here but I guess it's crowded everywhere in NYC!
Our favorite is the Seafood Ramen and Galbi Buns!
The Galbi was very tender and flavorful. Ramen broth was good with fresh seafood and perfect for the cold in New York!
I just wish their cocktails were better. They premade it ahead of time so it tastes good in a different way. I'd like it more if they make it fresh per order.
Anyway we had a good time here! Thanks Barn Joo!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"The food is bomb.
I had the veggie dumplings which were delicious and not too oily.
The cocktails were most Impressive.

Its usually busy on a Friday night but would recommend.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Great spot for a quick meal before a show or before heading to penn station. It looks small when you first walk in, but they have an upper floor with a bar. Food comes out quick and they have an interesting selection of drinks. Order one of the hot pots, but watch the bowl it's sizzling!! The tiger sushi is also really tasty!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Definitely not an impressive place for tapas for multitude of reasons.

FOOD QUALITY:
The food here is a bit hit or miss -- the chicken wings were sucked dry of most of their natural moisture, while their Brussels sprouts with vegetables just swam in a sea of oil. These particularly two dishes really drowned my tongue with flat fatty flavors and decimated any delicate notes that you'd expect from chicken or vegetables.

The plus? The soft shell crab was executed perfectly: light crisp, semi-fresh crab with an aioli that balanced the sharp breading but supplemented the bright acidity from the lemon.  

SERVICE:
Equated to a Chinese restaurant with our waiter disappearing for a long time while waiting for our check

ENVIRONMENT:
It's so cramped and unpleasantly loud in here, even by Manhattan's standards. It felt like I was more at a bar in the lower east side where you literally have to shout to hear anything at all.

This was a pretty hard pass for food, but if you're here just for drinks it may just be OK",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"this is one of my favorite date night spots. the food is amazing, the service is great, and i've never been disappointed!

if you're vegetarian, you HAVE to get the crunchy tofu. and if they're still serving the kimchi udon special, you have to get that as well! i will be going back soon! :)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Wow! A two-story place that lets you check-in on the Yelp app and as soon as we walked in the door they seated us ahead of several people! It is a great option!

We perused the menu and couldn't decide on small plates or entrees, so we talked to the server and he guided us to order a few small plates.

The tuna donut was an interesting round of rice that was warm and layered with spices, then topped with tuna slices and a small vial of soy to drip over the pieces. It was incredible!

Then the grilled pork belly. OMG. It was out of this world!

A set of galbi buns, soft with crunchy, almost charred meat. A flavor that's hard to explain but I want more of!

The spicy shrimp were fried in a sauce that was sweet with a tang that stung my tongue and made me have a bit more sake than I should have!

Lastly, the shrimp roll incredible but too filling after everything else. We were exploding!

Well, always room for dessert and they have a great list - only we didn't order the lava cake ahead of time and our server said it would take 25 mins. So, my advice - order it halfway through the meal so you can enjoy it - we had to leave so we missed out!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"My family and I came here one weekend to celebrate mother's day late. My mom loves korean food, and we've already tried most restaurants in Koratown (mainly the restaurants on 32). So I wanted to take her somewhere she hasn't been before.

We all ordered hot stone bowls. I got the eel, my brother the chicken, and my mom the seafood. We were excited and had higher expectations. Sadly the food fell short. The hot stone bowls (from my understanding) are usually served with white rice. However, theirs is served with brown rice and quinoa... yes... brown rice and quinoa. This completely threw off the flavors, resulting in a less than satisfying taste. I just endedup eating the eel on top and neither my brother or my mother finished their meals or wanted it packed up (which is saying something).

Also, the free soju shot you get from checking in on yelp is the grape one.. tasted like robitussin (cold medicine)... not cute or tasty. To improve our drinking situation, we also got the makgeolli (which is in a bottle for those who care). Honestly, the makgeolli at Take 31 is waay better, and you get more imo.

Sadly, we won't be coming here again. Maybe I missed the marketing of this place as a healthy Korean restaurant? Or maybe I just didn't read the menu that closely? (Let's be real.. with my attention to detail (or lack thereof), I probably missed this point completely). Either way, I wish I chose another restaurant.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"First time at this specific location but I've been to the Union Square one twice and it's always a good experience.

The wings are always good- I prefer the soy garlic flavor. The skin is very crunchy and there's a lot of meat on the bones.

I'd give the truffle fries a 3/5 - definitely could use a lot more of the truffle flavor.

As for the Galbi buns, it definitely wasn't anything I was expecting. I thought it would be slices of Galbi (beef short ribs) but the texture was almost like a Galbi meatball or more similar to ground beef.

The bulgogi stone pot was average, wouldn't get it again but it was still enjoyable. I think it just gets boring to eat after a while because it's just rice and the beef and not so much other stuff (only some few veggies are added).

Overall the food was still enjoyable and food was good as usual. It can be loud and rowdy but it's fun and a good place to go for happy hour or for a casual dinner with friends!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"Intimate place with a novel approach to Korean tapas. The kimchi udon pasta was delicious, the other dishes we got were goo, service was good, Could be improved by offering more sides",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"I love the Korean food and Spanish tapas culture. So for me, this was the perfect place to spend my nights on - even the atmosphere is very cozy and hip too. My favorites were Fish buns, NY Bites, and Shrimp ceviche. Don't skip the desserts as their bread pudding is amazing. Place yourself on the waiting list at night as it gets crowded very fast!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"We thought it was a great place from the reviews about food, to the location and service if you care about that kind of thing. I saw a picture of the cooked tiger fire roll and couldn't wait to go try it so we got the fried sushi roll, soy garlic wings and truffle fries. All dishes are delicious and served fast. We tried the Japchae- authentic noodles with beef given the waiters recommendation and I was set on having the wings with fries so we sent that back. We were told the dinner appetizer portions are smaller and for lunch the sushi roll is bigger. We also got the Sapporo beer and thought that was a better deal then getting a cocktail or wine. You get more for your buck with the beer at this place.

The prices are fair for the location and we would definitely recommend returning for lunch. The ambiance was lovely and the bathrooms were clean. At around 7:30 dinner there was a bit of a wait of maybe 15-30 minutes. You know it's good when you see the tables turn over quickly while providing a genuinely carefull service. We really enjoyed celebrating my 30th birthday here. Definitely get the check in offer!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"We arrived at around 6:40 pm on a weekday and didn't really have to wait for a table, but the restaurant was pretty packed and very noisy. When we sat down it took a while to get our server to notice us and get water.

We ordered the bulgogi, which had a delicious truffle flavor to it. I thought it was a perfect balance between a traditional bulgogi and truffle flavor. Highly recommend if you like truffle oil.

The sashimi ceviche was also extremely flavorful. I've unfortunately never had ceviche so I can't speak to the fusion, but the cold noodles and the sashimi were perfect. Highly recommend this as well.

Don't forget to get your complimentary soju for checking in!

I would've given Barn Joo 35 5 stars except it really took too long for the waiter to notice us. We sat there for about 15 minutes waving until she finally saw us and gave us water.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"My partner and I took shelter here during the winter cold and rain of Bryant park. We were enticed by the idea of a Korean Gastropub, for me two of my favorite words regarding food. We were delighted to find that during happy hour Barn Joo offers $1 Korean style double fried chicken wings, as well as some other food and drink specials.

I must say that I am not a fan of wings, and have begrudgingly ate them all my life when brought to a place that serves them. However, I had always heard of the legendary status of Korean fried chicken so I decided to give them a try, and holy shit was I in love, I picked every single piece clean to the bone with a fury akin to a starved tiger coming upon its first meal in a week. I even ordered more. I also enjoyed some of the happy hour drink specials that mostly use soju cocktails, a nice touch. I also was quite fond of the Gochujang Fondue.

I am happy to see a place put effort into making sure that their listing is a fusion of the two cuisines they tout. For many times I find myself in places that say they are fusion, but in actuality separate their cuisines heavily, and just offer both.

Well done Barn Joo 35, you have made it on my list of must see spots for guests to the city.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants
Barn Joo 35,"THE BEST SERVICE - ANDREW

We came in last week and Andrew was helping us. He was so kind, helpful, and informative. We had the Softshell Crab, Garlic Soy Chicken Wings, and Kimchi Pancake. Everything was super delicious and Andrew even recommended us a bunch of drinks and dessert options that were to die for.

We ordered the Uni Bibimbap, Bulgogi Hot Stone Bibimbap, and the Kalbi buns. Our food came out pretty fast and was good. The only thing I would've liked is more vegetables in the Bulgogi bibimbap, there was a lot of meat but I like a variety of things in my bowl. However, the Uni Bibimbap seemed to have a lot of vegetables, which were all very cold, crisp, and delicious. The Kalbi buns were also good.

We were in NYC visiting from Miami, and met up with college friends from 25 years ago (how am I that old?)

I looked up places to eat near our hotel on Yelp, and Barn Joo 35 was delivered to my phone.  
Important things to know:
-You can join the waitlist on Yelp and walk on over to Barn Joo and check in, thus reducing your wait time when you arrive.
-They have a small downstairs and a bigger upstairs for seating
-The bulgogi hotstone bowl is AMAZING.  Just get it.
-Waitstaff was professional, courteous, and had great suggestions
-Drinks are phenomenal, and there's a free one for a Yelp Check-In.

Barn Joo 35,Good food; I have eaten both at their union square and midtown locations. Fries to die for. And my friend enjoyed her wings and tuna rolls. My husband ordered the table bbq. He found the beef tender but felt that they should have trimmed the fat when they served. I had a soju all by myself - bad decision for a light drinker!!! It is a bit noisy but not too much compared to other similar establishments and difficult to have a conversation.

Barn Joo 35,I had a solo dinner here a couple of nights ago. I was hoping to try the uni Bibimbap but unfortunately they were out of the uni. I opted for the bulgogi and the hot and spicy chicken wings instead. Both were excellent. The bulgogi was nice and tender and you can almost never go wrong with korean fried chicken wings. The only drawback to this venue was that it came with none of the pickled sides that I'm used to elsewhere. I understand that it's NYC but I feel like kimchi as a side should be standard as it is everywhere else.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/barn-joo-35-new-york?osq=restaurants

We vacationed here last summer and because we did DC, NYC and MA I just was too exhausted to review. Well, it's not too late since my love for our NYC trip is still hot and true to this day. We love you NYC! Stay strong and get through this! See you on the other side when we come back again one of these days!

Now back to the Halal Guys!! These guys are the real deal! It was the first time we've ever introduced our kids to middle Eastern food. They liked it a lot. It was dinner time when we got to NYC and this was the first thing we ate. It was so delicious and there was a long line! The guys cooking and packing were ridiculously efficient. I had a chicken gyro and others had the platter. Both were really yummy and all the different ingredients/flavors worked together so well.  Our hotel was a few blocks away so we actually walked to 53rd/6th.  Doing this review I just saw that there are actually 2 Halal Guy restaurants in SJ. I They have over 1k reviews but the star rating is a 3. I'm curious to find out how good it is or should I just let this beautiful memory life as is in NYC? I'm afraid to I'll be diapppointed...but then on the other hand...I might just find a taste of NY in SJ. Might find my way there after all this is over!

Don't have a bad thing to say besides the price is a little steep and I wish it was lower like it was a few years ago but got to take good aight the bad ‍ May I suggest for them hoping they see this is to maybe give a discount on a buy one get one half or something type deal?,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

We have one in Toronto but this cart is something else. It's a loaded combo and the price can't be beat compared to their store locations.

The Halal Guys,"Of course I had to stop by the OG Halal Guys on my trip to New York. It was a rainy day and I walked about 30+ blocks for it and man was it worth it! I ordered a Chicken Shawarma plate with no tomatoes. The employees were so generous with their servings that I was able to eat half for lunch and save the other half for dinner. The workers were kind and saw me wanting to sit and eat on a bench when it stopped raining and one sweet guy came and gave me some paper towels to wipe down the bench. Overall, food was yummy and comforting (we love street food!) and if you are ever in New York you should definitely stop and eat here I mean after all this is where it all began!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"You don't believe that I buy the White sauce after I try the beef bowl. Not far away from my apartment, in front of the MoMA.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Some might say the official food of New York is a pizza, maybe even a sandwich from a bodega, but my vote is for the Halal guys. It's fast, filling, and delicious! Their chain has grown from one cart to multiple carts, to stores opening across the country. Maybe cause this was the original cart, or something about waiting in line, eating your plate sitting on a uneven surface outdoors, and people watching that makes the food from this cart taste the best.

FYI I recommend a combo platter for variety and ask for the hot sauce on the side. Apply it cautiously as it is no joke!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"On a rainy cold day in NYC, I am so glad they were opened late at midnight! I needed food and many places closed around the area. Can't beat their combo meat/chicken over rice.

I love the white sauce and can't get enough of it. Fast service as well. Given it was late, the rice was not as hot but overall still a great choice in the area and will always return.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Talk about a drop in quality. Prior to opening up multiple carts and 2 brick and mortar stores; this was the original location and the place to go for halal chicken and rice. Not anymore the quality has been steadily going down hill since they've started mass producing everything like an assembly line. Hell even the white sauce now comes in a logo embossed factory made pouch. The rice is dry and hard. Meats are either overdone, over seasoned, unseasoned, or somehow all of the above. I really hope they can turn things around because this place use to be work the 30 min wait in line even at 1am.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"THAT HOT SAUCE has got heat!

Generous portions here and plenty of food for 2 or 3 with just 2 items. I enjoyed the gyro but the chicken was also DARK MEAT for those of you that prefer that for some extra flavor. Very fast service and popular spot.

Ask for extra hot sauce and extra jalapenos if you like heat but they'll only give you 2 packs of hot sauce and their white sauce unless you request it.

I'll probably try their falafels next time and get way more sauce because it adds a lot!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I've heard of the Halal Guys from long ago and have always wanted to try and finally got the chance with my recent trip to New York. This is definitely a place frequented by many tourists and while lines may get relatively long (no matter what time of day), it does move by quick. Food is inexpensive for the generous portion you get.

Each platter is huge. I tried to finish a small combo platter by myself and barely made a dent. It is a lot of meat so it fills you up fast. If I were to come back, I would definitely share with a friend. True to popular belief, the white sauce is definitely the winner that completes and adds flavor to the dish. I would highly recommend using the red sauce sparingly because it is SUPER SPICY, and this is coming from someone who can typically stand a lot of spice.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Let me be clear I've had some great Halal Guys experiences, but my most recent one was genuinely disappointing.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

If there isn't a robust line it's hard to argue with the speed and efficiency of The Halal Guys. I barely had my combination order out of my mouth before the plate was in my hands and I was on my merry way. Star.

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

$9.00 for a large plate of food with as much if not more food than a Chipotle burrito is a good deal. Star.

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

What a huge letdown this was. I'm not sure what was up, but both meats were dry, the rice was dry and tasted like cardboard, and the lettuce might as well have been paper. The sauce kinda sorta saved the day, but not really. No Stars.

Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?

Based on this experience? No, given the fierce competition these days. No Star.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Everyone that's a Halal Guys fan knows about the original cart at 53rd and 6th. But if you're getting off the train and you want to get your Halal Guys fix quickly? Well, that's what the Halal Guys cart at 53rd and 7th is for! Literally got off the train and dropped myself right next to the cart.

Obviously, I ordered the standard regular combo platter. It tastes the exact same as the original cart at 53rd and 6th, which means it's still AWESOME. The only thing is that I was so hungry that I forgot to take a picture!

Staff here were as expected. Since this is the cart that is way less traveled, I didn't have to wait in line to get my food. Put my order in, got my food, got some white sauce to go, and back on the train I went.

Obviously from a legacy standpoint, I always have to make a trip to 53rd and 6th. But it's good to know that 53rd and 7th exists when I just need to get some proper Halal Guys and be on my way.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"This is a must when we visit the city. No matter where we stay well worth the effort either walking or trains.
Got the large beef gyro platter meat, rice, salad and pita bread.  And best of all it was only $9.  The meat and rice was perfectly seasoned and the garlic dressing which comes in a large packet was good, put it on everything.  Next visit will get the combo chicken and beef dinner.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"So a friend of mine actually got me onto this place out in SF getting food late night after being out drinking. I'd still seek it out just for this reason.

It's open late, and it hits a mark. Not the best thing I've tasted but it survives the microwave well for a simple cheap meal in the middle of the city at night and I don't have to demolish the whole thing. And it is flavorful in different ways. The guys at the cart were generally helpful (definitely strolled here late night with some headphones on) and could accommodate a bit with me trying to be healthy about the meal and swap all the rice for lettuce. I doused it with the white sauce anyway, who am I really kidding? But that is what was the nice thing. You can get all the stuff to take back with you and hide somewhere to relish in the bounty and design it however you'd like.

I did have to check this one out too since I had heard one of them was the original. It gets pretty damn busy around there tho when it's a popular time for people to be out so if you're under a time crunch, bear that in mind.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Not for my taste! I mean the food is ok, but over spiced and so salty. I'm not saying to don't go over there, but if you don't like spices or salty food just go somewhere else.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"So happy I got to try Halal Guys in New York!!! It taste so much better than the one in California. There's something about eating it here that made such a difference in quality and taste.

Since it was raining the night I went, there was barely any line! I decided to get the large combination plate which was about $9. It's half chicken and gyro, salad, rice and pita bread. Don't forget to get extra white sauce because that's one of the best part of this dish. The chicken and gyro was flavorful and cooked just right. The rice and salad adds a nice touch to the dish. I wish they gave more pita bread slices.

Honestly, I should have brought some back to CA because now I'm craving it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Food is delicious and fast. Chicken is some of the best I've seen however I wish they used more white meat or all white meat and also no cartilage. Lines can be long depending when you go. Surrounding areas of the cart and where people sit and dine on public sidewalks and fixtures can be dirty from trash left behind. This has improved throughout the years. Staff are always rude, impolite, arrogant and borderline disrespectful. For someone coming here for 10yrs that has never changed. If your there just to get some food quickly and leave and not worry about hospitality then this is your place.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"This is the original Halal Guys. After pretty mediocre experiences with other locations I have tried, it seems to be that the other locations are just straight up fast food with heat lamps on the meats rather than the fresh meats prepared in the carts. There's this significant difference that makes all the difference between this original halal cart and the Halal Guys other locations. Even the meat is more tender and flavorful than the other locations. Prices are much cheaper, by at least 30% compared to the Halal Guys in the Bay Area, for instance. Only downside is that they only take cash, which is quite inconvenient in today's commerce. I would not hesitate to come back to try this again, even though I'm generally not a fan of going to the same restaurant twice.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,I love Halal Guys when I'm back home in NYC! I just walked 12 blocks from the Hilton in Times Square to 53rd to grab myself a gyro platter with a side of falafel and hummus! Yassss! Home sweeet home! Love myself my NYC food carts! Screw the high end eateries when you've got soul food this good!,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Review #500 has to go to the OG of street food. You don't understand what you've grown up with and taken for granted until you move away and have to eat the crap quality all these other franchises put out.

Remember the steaming plate of chicken, beef gyro (what happened to the ""lamb??""), rice, pita and lettuce isn't supposed to be the best. When you need a filling, cheap meal and/or when you're out late at night, THIS is the best. Drench that ish in their mysteriously seducing white sauce, but watch out for the fiery hot red sauce.

Also when did they jack up the price to $9?? I remember when it was a $6 steal, the hike to $7, then shanking us at $8 when I last left NY. $9 is a kick in the nuts...I'm still begrudgingly going to pay though. I'm always looking forward to visiting this spot when back in town.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"LOVE IT!

I'm a fan back home in LA so I was ecstatic to try the OG location in NYC! And it DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!

Chicken platter $8 with fresh meat + unlimited white sauce = heaven. Workers are also very kind! Love that they're not stingy with the sauces either. Back in LA, they charge you extra for white sauce. Here, you have the ability to pour as much as you want.

Love itttt!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Wow this stuff just hits the spot! You wouldn't think much of this food stand but there is a reason it is so highly rated! I have been to the location in Chicago and this food cart is so much better!

I got the chicken and beef gyro combo over rice. The regular size is $9 which is a good deal considering the portion is so large that you get two meals out of it! The food is just as good as you have heard. Soft and flavorful meat with a base of rice and lettuce on the side for a nice crunch. I preferred the chicken over the gyro, but they were both still very good. The white sauce tasted like ranch to me and is definitely a necessity on top of the dish. You can add the red sauce if you want a bit of spice, though I don't think it needs it.

I honestly cannot say anything that has not already been said. The food here is amazing! I would honestly come here all the time if I lived in the city. So worth it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"53rd and 6th, the original, it is undefeated. Best thing to eat in New York City! Nothing beats it, perfect when its 10 degrees out in winter or 90 degrees on a hot summer day.

The Halal Guys,"Beyond good.  White sauce for days and the hot sauce is just that -- freaking hot so use as you see fit.  When hanging out in one of the most expensive areas in NYC this is a lot of food for a good price.  

Just came back from a trip to LAS and they have a franchise in Caesar's Place -- wth?   Did not try it but will next time!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"You can't beat the price, portion size, quality, and white sauce here. I'm a picky eater and don't like vegetables so finding a halal place that doesn't cook their meats with chunks of onions, etc. has been quite difficult. The Halal Guys are able to incorporate tremendous flavor in the meats which pair extremely well with their signature white sauce. The rice is always cooked to perfection and the pita is always super soft.

I always get the same thing, beef and chicken combo, no veggies whether it be at the food carts or the original brick and mortar store. The quality and service has always been consistent and efficient wherever I choose to go. One of these combos yields 2 meals for me because they're huge! I'll always be coming back for more as long as I'm in NYC.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Coming from LA, there are halal guys in several cities, but when I was planning my trip to New York, I wanted to give the OG halal guys a try. When I came around 5 pm on a Friday night and the line was not that long... I had maybe 3 people in front of me but I waited a good 15-20 minutes for my food. They had food available but were not serving anyone and did not even bother to let us know what was taking so long.

I got the combo bowl, $9, which comes with beef, chicken, rice, and lettuce. I was disappointed when they did not have tomatoes when I asked because I usually order extra tomatoes back in LA. The chicken was different too. It's shredded and softer instead of cubes of chicken, which I did not mind. They do give you packets of white and red sauce instead of squeezing it directly into your bowl, so you can add as much or as little as you want. But overall, I give this place a 3.5/5 stars because of service and it was nothing special.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"A NYC staple. Yes theres usually a line. Yes its worth it. Meats are juicy, tender and so flavorful. Rice is always perfectly cooked. The hot sauce is surprisingly HOT, so I always get it on the side and add just a little. White sauce cools it down nicely. It's just the perfect meal. I usually have a rule about street food needing to be portable...kebab, hot dog, sandwich, etc. You can't eat a bowl of soup while standing in the street right? This is the only exception. EVER.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Have had Halal Guys a couple of times. The memory of it was better than having it right in front of me. We ordered a Chicken and Rice platter. It's a heavy amount of food.

The rice and chicken are solid. They get to the point right away, no funny business. There's also some salad at the bottom that works as a little moisture in there to break up the heaviness. The white sauce is tasty and necessary. They have a generous amount of the sauce packets automatically workout even asking. Cool. The red sauce is so much hotter than I remember. Maybe we drizzled too much on because that stuff burns. It was an assault, and a good one.

There's inevitably a line of at least 10 people waiting. Once your order and pay, you get your food in a bag almost instantaneously. Seemless logistics from start to finish. There are little walls nearby to sit on and eat.

Would come back. But wouldn't go out if my way to do so.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

And small for $6.
If you want lamb, you got to pay $11 for small and $13 for large.

Order a large combo platter of chicken and beef on rice and you will surely be satisfied. Add a lot (I mean a lot) of white sauce, some of that super spicy hot sauce, and stand around like everyone else and pig out.

It is no longer the cheapest halal option around. Why would they when tourists now seek them out from all over the world? Regardless, if I see practically no line, then it's on like Donkey Kong.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"Halal guys is great. Located near hilton hotel, a small food truck serving awesome food.

I have only tried regular chicken platter. They give you 2 packets of white sauce which is world popular and one of the main reason why halal guys is soooo popular. You also get few packets of red sauce. It's extremely spicy but adds a good flavor.

They didn't have any baklava and I've heard their falafel is meh. So chicken platter with white sauce is YUMMMYY and must have.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"We ordered the mixed combo plate and it was pretty good. Halal Guys in general I feel is a little overrated, in the sense that it's basically just standard fast food with sauce. This truck particularly does a good job though and taste just a tad better.

Tastes like the one on the west coast so the consistent quality is there but it's still average to my taste buds.

Pros:
-Even if there's a wait they are pretty quick. One person takes orders, two people are cooking. Pretty good assembly line going for efficient, on the go food.
-Cheap. A small combo was $7.
-They pack your order with a bunch of hot sauce and white sauce. Great that they aren't stingy.

Cons:
-The taste is ok. I would say without the sauce it's pretty bland. Filling, but bland.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"My girlfriend from NYC directed us to eat here. Her specific instruction was to go to ""The Halal Guys"" cart. The name must have all three words, no less/no more, or else you're eating at a copy cat! THE. HALAL. GUYS. Remember that! And, it's the cart across the street from Hilton on W 53rd and 6th.

We found THE HALAL GUYS! Lol. Yep, there was a little wait on a Thursday at 1:30pm. But, not too long. A huge batch of meats were already prepared on the hot plate and ready to be scooped up and placed into a round foil platter or wrapped up into a sandwich.

Between the two of us, we decided to share a regular size Platter C, which was the Chicken and Beef Gyro combo. Lettuce, chicken, and beef over a bed of turmeric and cumin seasoned basmati rice with a few small slices of pita bread. Our plate was placed into a plastic bag with two packets of their famous white sauce and one packet of red sauce.

Now, my friend said the sauce packets are like gold. So, the smart thing to do is drizzle some sauce onto your food from the bottles at the cart and then you can save your packets for later! Unfortunately, no sauce bottles at the cart. Not sure if they discontinued this offering. Probably caught onto the sauce hype because I hear they actually charge for extra packets. The other tip, even if you love spicy, was to only squirt the red sauce into one corner instead of ALL OVER like the white sauce. Lol. I can see why. Trust me. It's hotttt!!!! And I love spicy!!!!

So since we were on vacay and didn't have an office to return to, we actually walked into the nearest Starbucks to purchase some cold beverages and then feast on our plates (we noticed others doing this, too!) in an air conditioned space.

The verdict?? OMG!! So DELICIOUS!! The chicken and beef were nicely seasoned and chopped in such a way it made for a perfect bite of rice, meat, and lettuce. Not chunky and overbearing. The plate was so good we inhaled that thing in two minutes. The sauces really heightened the flavors to a whole other level. Ugh. Wish we had this in Hawaii. But I do see The Halal Guys is now in CA and NV! Sweet! I'll have to check them out on the West Coast.

If you're wondering about Halal meat, it is pork free and produced in accordance with Islamic rules and contains Halal ingredients and is lawful for Muslim consumption.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"They give you packets of sauce instead of squeezing it on, I think owing to the fact that they get real busy around lunch times.

I went in the early afternoon and they had chicken and beef options, and mentioned that lamb came later in the day. First time this has happened, so ymmv.

The red sauce isn't as hot as they say. If you order a 6/10 at a Thai place or can handle spicier Chinese / curry meals, you're good for ~3 packs of hot sauce.

The salad is a pretty sad salad, so my recommendation is just rice, meat, and sauce. Keep in mind also that each pack of the white sauce is 330 calories (didn't know this until I squat down and did some reading-while-eating). Holy moly. Good to know if you're on a diet, but who can say no to that stuff...

As other reviews mention, there are cheaper (~$6, which is only a buck or two cheaper, but it's like 15-25%) places that have comparable offerings. Still, it's a convenient location with expensive rent and I figure Halal Guys can go toe-to-toe with any other halal cart I've had on flavor and portion.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Because of this place's insane popularity, i decided to take the subway here just to try it out. It was around 6pm and still raining a bit. I ordered a combo platter and got my food very fast because all the guy did was scoop the content from the containers.

I don't know if they normally would refresh it up when it's not raining, but maybe because they didn't, the meat felt a bit dry. Rice was good, i always enjoy Mediterranean rice. The vegetable portion was just iceberg lettuce. Where sauce was decent. Hot sauce was supppper hot like the dry hot type that just burns. The whole experience just felt underwhelming and disappointing.

The Halal Guys,"NYC Halal Carts are pretty well known at this point- there's nothing like a chicken over rice platter at 2:00 in the morning. However, there has to be well over a thousand in the city. But this one? This is THE Halal Cart.

I'm not sure if this was the first, or how this cart came to stardom, but this was the cart that started the national chain of Halal Guys locations. They're fast, they're efficient, and they make some good food.

You'll see people lined up from streets away below their yellow umbrellas... and the lines MOVE. You can be in the back of a line of 30 people, and still get your food within minutes. Right near the carts is a block of public benches, providing a good place to sit down with your food.

The regular sized platter itself is enough food for the entire day in one sitting, but they also offer a small sized platter or gyros.

Although it may not be the healthiest food option, it's cheap and delicious, and it's probably one of the most popular drunchies you can find in the city.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"This is one of several food kiosks run by these guys in Manhattan with this one being closest to my hotel. I've noticed that there are many ""knock offs"" throughout the city so be aware of the fact if you are searching for them.

There happened to be no line when I got there but sure enough I started one!  The man I spoke to didn't understand my questions and even though I wanted a $6.00 beef gyro I ended up with a $9.00 beef halal dinner!

I took my meal to the hotel room and ate it there. This meat is very good and it is accompanied by a salad, rice, and sliced pita bread. They also give you a white sauce and hot sauce if you want to add to it. I used the white sauce and it was so good and very filling.

You can't beat a bargain like that here in NY. There's no best time to go but I did notice two more stands in the same general vicinity. They are marked ""the real"" Halal guys.  I loved the convenience of it and the fact that I could enjoy a great meal for a good price.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Before I even start my review, this place gets 5 stars from me because they said ""For the pretty lady, extra hot sauce!"" and gave me like 10+ extra hot sauces. They sure know the fastest way to my heart. Meat + rice + EXTRA hot sauce. What else can I possibly ask for?

Apparently this place started all the way back in 1990, and 3 partners came up with a halal food cart with chicken and gyro over rice because of a high demand from Muslim cab drivers! Good thing they did because I freaking LOVE this place.

Whenever I come up to NY for work, I stand in the ridiculous line that goes for a block or two so that I can buy 4 - 6 platters of Combo ($8/each) to bring back home (Baltimore) with me. Of course, extra hot sauce please!

When I get home, I open up these bad boys, drown them in their famous white and red sauce. CAUTION: their red/hot sauce is ACTUALLY spicy!!!! I thought I was born with an iron stomach that can withstand all levels of spice but Halal Guys proved me wrong - usually 1 packet of red sauce for the entire platter is enough but I like to push my limit and put 2 - 3 packets. YESSSSSS, BURN MY SOUL!!!!

Their pita bread does get soggy because it sits in the platter on the way home but this is easily fixed if I pop them into the toaster oven for a few minutes!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Truly sad day to give such an average rating to such a formerly beloved food place.

So many fond memories of this food stand over the years, beginning when I was a still a student in NYC.  Back then +10 years ago, this place used to be referred to as ""the chicken and rice place on 53rd and 6th,"" not the Halal Guys.  I'm glad they're successful and commercialized, but things have changed dramatically since then.

A plate used to be ~$5 for one or the other meat, ~$6 for a combo.  Now it's a whopping $9!  It's no longer one of the cheap eats, which made it one of the hidden gems of the city.  No way it should have risen so high so quickly even accounting for inflation.  To put things in perspective, for comparison a slice of Artichoke Pizza back then was $5; ~10 years later today, it's $6.

It used to be either chicken or lamb gyro.  Now it's chicken or beef gyro.  Beef gyro???  I asked one of the guys recently when they changed to beef. His response - ""it's always been beef.""  Really...?  You know we have pictures on yelp, etc. to prove otherwise.  I was a bit insulted, but didn't bother arguing with him, not worth it.  I speculate it's likely a business move, maybe cheaper to produce beef or something along those lines, but not worth my time either to look into it.  They're a national chain now, I'm sure they're not going to revert back.

The meat quality this visit was ok, but not excellent anymore.  It's the rice and white sauce I thought that made it stand out compared to other halal carts (who btw still sell for $5-$6 a plate with comparable quality), and those aspects I'll be fair seemed to remain consistent.  Overall, the declining meat quality, move away from lamb, and trouble going out of your way to get here (hardly anyone spends an evening hanging out in Midtown East) does not justify the price point.

Places change.  The NYC you experience won't be the same as the previous or future generations.  A lot of places that once were considered good are either gone (Carnegie Deli, Crumbs) or a shell of their former selves (Magnolia Bakery, Corner Bistro).  That's just how the city evolves.  

However this food stand has changed won't take away the memories of late nights/after hours waiting in line, all the stories that accompanied, all the times we bought 4-5 plates to take home to eat during the week.  Just sad that this place will never truly be there anymore in my mind.

The end of an era.

FYI here is my own personal rating system

5=worth a trip, something you'll crave
4=worth getting but only if you're already in the area
3=only worth it if it's free/discounted, not worth paying full price
2=would not even eat it if free, waste of stomach space
1=the place should shut down",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Probably the cleanest halal food cart there is. they also have select locations in the city and queens.

pros - probably the standard you should be comparing your halal food too. the chicken and lamb combo ftw. also  have to try to hot sauce. i remember driving here at 3am in the morning after going out. this place is probably packed in the mid afternoon and dinner time.

avoid the physical location since they charge tax and they usually give less portion wise. also if one cart is full on 53rd and 6th, just walk a block over to the same exact cart and place your order. this place has really grown in size and popularity. definitely a must try.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"You know your girl had to go to the original Halal Guys.

After many years of hype in California after their opening I knew I had to try this place from it's original source.  I love that it is still a simple food stand that offers cheap ass good quality food.  And it was only like a 5 minute walk from our hotel.  Win!  For a combo of chicken and beef it was only $8.  And unlike California, they do not charge extra for sauce.  Two packets of white sauce and two packets of their spicy sauce and you are golden.  Lettuce was fresh, generous portion of delicious flavored meats, and bomb as rice.  I shared it with one other person and it was the perfect size.  The over 9k reviews don't lie.  It is good.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,NYC's BEST all around! Astounding costs for what you get and the area. I'd regularly have lunch here as my office is near by. Only con is the long lines! but its definitely worth it!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I've tried The Halal Guys in California before but when coming to New York I knew I had to try it straight from the food stand. There are actually a couple of food stands in that area, one on each side of the intersection. I'd recommend beating the lunch rush because I came at 11:30am and there was no line. When I walked past the same area at 12pm there was a huge line.

I ordered the chicken platter ($8) which includes rice, veggies, chicken and pita. The chicken is soft, the rice is flavorful, and everything is just good. It comes with red and white sauce which are absolutely lovely. If you're like me you will find yourself pouring all the white sauce on everything because it's that addicting. Be careful about putting the red sauce because it's really spicy.

I'm not sure if they take card or not but it's just easier with cash. $8 for the amount of food that you get and the quality of the food is just so worth. There are no tables near by except some benches. If you really want a table to sit and eat you can walk to The Plaza mall which is about 5 blocks away.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star is because my order was not completely correct and I paid extra for it. Selection of food to choose from. Quick delivery, I mean quick. The food tasted really good. I do with the humus cane with like pita chips versus the wrap thing to dip it in. Other than my order not being exactly what I wanted it was still amazing",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"What more needs to be said?  This place is fan-fucking-tastic.  I've eaten all over New York City, yet no meal was nearly as satisfying as when I waited in a 20 minute queue wrapped around a city corner in 14 degree weather on New Year's Eve for my first plate of gyro, chicken, rice, salad, and hot pita.  

I asked the guy who built my plate ""What's this white sauce?""  Maybe he misheard me, but he answered, brilliantly, ""....that is white sauce.""",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"As someone who loves Halal carts, on my most recent trip to NYC I knew I had to make the pilgrimage to the original location: The Halal Guys.  One night, we made our way over to 53rd and embarked on what we fully expected to be an incredible meal.

We went for two combo platters, one regular and one small.  The first thing you'll notice about the Halal Guys that may be different from other carts is that they offer chicken and beef, but not lamb.  Further, the sauces are in bottles on the side of the cart and are self-dispensed by patrons.  Thirdly, the platters are served with pita bread, which was something I was unused to.  While other carts throughout the city are relatively cheap, The Halal Guys are a touch more expensive ($9 for a regular platter, $7 for a small and $1 for drinks, not included).

We seated ourselves on the nearby ledge and began our feast.  I dispensed a hearty amount of white and red sauce into my platter and mixed it in.  As someone who's a huge fan of the red sauce, I went a little overboard here.  It was SPICY.  Be very careful using this sauce not to make your food inedible.  The food was absolutely delicious, but I definitely found myself wishing I had used less of the red sauce.

Overall, The Halal Guys is a street cart that is very much a part of NYC Street Food history, and one you should absolutely check out.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,They have and consistently will be the BEST around! Astounding costs for what you get and the area. I'd regularly preferably have lunch from here over a 4-star Midtown café.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,Can't beat the original halal guys cart! Now that the holiday season is over there aren't those crazy long lines so I was able to get my food under five minutes flat! Ordered the chicken platter with extra white sauce please! Loved every bite!!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Before coming to NY, I had never tried Halal Guys before. I somehow didn't know they had one around my house in Orange County.

When my family first saw this stand on a busy street in NY, they didn't think they could trust getting food from a small little stand like this. There's a common belief among people that food at a stand is low quality and can get you sick. I was like, ""Come on let's just give it a try"" and they reluctantly gave in.

Honestly, with empty stomachs, we just couldn't pass it by after seeing the HUGE crowd of people getting food from there and the amazing swell wafting from the stand.

We waited in the long line and I ordered a simple gyro with everything in it. For how much they give you, it's incredibly cheap. They generously put a ton of the thin meat strips inside and my first bite with everything in it was so heavenly. Literally HEAVEN BUT IN THE FORM OF FOOD. It had so much flavor, even before adding any of the sauces.

People are knocking this place for its bad, rushed service, but you can't blame them because they have to deal with crazy crowds just trying to get some amazing food.

Overall, a cheap place to have a great lunch in NY!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Passed by it, was hungry, and know it by name from the other cart (the one that has 9000 reviews), so I tried it. This is the one by the love sign but this place has no love, food sucks and should have went to the other spot. Everything is super precooked and he just packs it for you. Normally you think great, get my food fast but it just means all the meat is over cooked. The rice isnt that great either, and the sauce comes in packets (they don't drizzle it on from the bottle). Honestly, I get street meat all the time in NYC and this stands out as being one of the worse ones I've had.

The only pleasure I got was sitting at a table across the street and feeding my pita to the birds. Just keep walking passed this cart.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Everything you could have imagined and MORE! It's no lie folks; The Halal Guys is friggin' sensational! HUGE ass deliciously filling Halal platters and sammies at your service from day until the late night!

The Halal Guys just recently migrated over into my hood (the Bay Area), and I had the pleasure of trying it a few months back. At first, I couldn't understand why so many East Coasters weren't impressed with the new Bay Area popups because I thought it was rather tasty. I didn't have anything to compare it to, and trying it for the first time in California was the first time that I had ever tried it. Welp... after trying the original, I COMPLETELY understand why they weren't impressed.

Like most ""original"" locations of restaurants, the original Halal Guys cart totally sh*ts on the Cali popups (as it probably should). There is no... I repeat, NO comparison! The quality of the meat that they be grillin' on that cart is just insane! And that mutha effin' WHITE SAUCE! LAAAWWWD! Come and help a sista out right NOW before I pass away from high cholesterol!!! Because, ya girl can use an ENTIRE damn bottle of that deliciously fattening white sauce on this platter without any regards.

EVERYTHING on that damn platter was fingerlickin' GOOD!! I got a combo platter with chicken and gyro... (pause). I'm sorry, I just had to take a moment to remember how effing FANTASTIC this meal was. The meat was flavorful , the veggies and rice were fresh, and the pita bread was warm and fluffy. Top that thang with hella white sauce, and you've got yourself the meal from East Coast Heaven right there. Maaaan, just the perfect little meal packed inside of a foil pan. They stuff that bad boy to the MAX! Literally made about 2 and half meals out of one platter.

Let's talk about that price tag; CHEEEAP!!! Less than $10 for a massive platter or gyro sammich. I live for affordable meal steals, especially when I'm on vacay. This is probably the best deal that you'll find in the city as far as street food goes. They're open late into the night which is a plus. I won't tell you what time that I actually consumed this meal because I don't need you or anyone else judging my fat ass. But, what you should know is that this meal is satisfying during any time of the day. Praise GAAAWD for the Halal Guys and all of its' glory. They got that crack! ... That HALAL cart crack, that is! You need to getchu sooome!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"For manhattan food, this is pretty affordable with a relatively large quantity. Between the lamb and chicken, I think lamb has more flavor, whereas the chicken tends to be more dry.

I haven't had a problem with wait time. They're often very fast and in a matter of minutes or sometimes even seconds, I get my meal.
Overall, decent halal, but a bit overrated in my opinion. If you didn't douse the platter in white sauce, the dish would be pretty dry.
3 stars - would eat here only if someone else suggested it.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"The Halal Guys, the one and only, found here amidst a whole bunch of other Halal Guys carts. You'll know which one is the original one by the line.

So I'm from LA and they opened up a few Halal Guys around there and they are not nearly as good as this one. I don't know what it is but this Halal Guys was heavenly. The combo plate is the thing to get along with a generous helping of their white and hot sauce. Nothing says comfort like chicken and rice (the combo is chicken and gyro but you get the gist). So be prepared to drench your plate in white sauce, drizzle or load up on hot sauce however you like the pain, and stuff yourself silly. Did my GI tract cry afterwards? Yes. Was it worth it? Ten times over and I'd do it again happily. So yes, this is a must.

This is cash only so come prepared with lots of it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Well I can say 'The Halal Guys' have not changed. I went and got a combo and pour the white Sauce on top.  I put some in my mouth and I just let it sit there a few minutes so my taste buds could absorbed all the flavors  Lamb, Chicken, orange rice with chop lettuce, and then with that magic White Sauce, Oh so good.

The chicken was so tender yet a bit chewy.  The spicy red sauce and mellow white sauce mixed in a with a little bit of lettuce made for a fast and affordable lunch.

My guy didn't want to try it when we were in Chicago a few months ago, but after this visit, he's craving it too.

the white sauce makes it even better but so fattening. if you tell them it's to go, they will packed it and then put the package sauce on the side for you. if you don't tell them to go, they'll just hand you the plate and all the sauce is in a container that you have to add on to your plate yourself.
Be careful - the hot sauce is really hot!

The area is great. There is a little ""park"" right across the street with tables and chairs that you can sit on and enjoy your food.

The Halal Guys,"After being in New York for two years I have finally come to Halal Guys!

Street food is the heart of the city. I have had numerous halal plates but for some reason The Halal Guys has never been part of the mix. I got the combo plate and doused it with white sauce and some hot sauce (I knew the hot sauce is a kicker). Overall it was a pleasant meal. I was a little underwhelmed with the seasoning. With all the food carts around the city you begin to try carts with seasonings of their own culture. Some are more aggressive and some less. This one was much less compared to other places I've had.

For $8 you get a good bang for your buck. I'll probably stick to my local carts that I know and love because I love that bold flavor but it was still nice trying Halal Guys",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"I came here late at night after walking around downtown, and found it quite satisfying, although not as mind-blowingly amazing as the reviews mentioned.

I tried the original platter and also a lamb platter; I really preferred the lamb more, as it had quite a strong lamb-ey taste (which some people don't like, but I actually search for it)!

There are many similar ""Halal guys"" food carts nearby pretending to be the real thing; make sure you're at the right one with the line! I'm not sure how similar the food is at the other locations is, but one of my friends said it was similar.

Make sure to add LOTS of sauce (both white and red); that's where all the flavour is from! And be careful, because the red is actually spicy (and I'm someone who loves to self-torture with spice)!

Sitting down on a bench/anyone nearby and people-watching is part of the experience. Great value overall!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

There are SOOO many other Halal Street Meat guys that have amazing food - their chicken is marinated with spices, and it's mixed with grilled onions and peppers. The rice is amazing etc. However, the Halal Guys' food is So Bland. The chicken is just shredded chicken with nothing else, and the lamb is regular gyro meat chopped up, and its served with rice, pita, and bunch of white sauce that would make a shoe taste good. All I'm saying is to walk around the block,  find another Halal food ""street Meat"" vendor (not these guys in the yellow shirts) and try them out. The difference is night and day.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Obviously I had to stop by the OG Halal Guys after only having tried their California locations! I had the late night munchies after bar hopping and luckily this street vendor was only a few blocks away from my hotel.

There was a pretty long line when I went, due to the late night bar crowd + the crowd from a music festival that was being held that weekend. It took a little longer than I expected and I waited for around 40 minutes, but it was worth it!

From reading all the reviews I guess it used to be really cheap here, but compared to CA it's not bad at all (NY small = $7, regular = $9; CA small = $9, regular $10). One of my friends got a kebab from one of those generic street vendors you see on every other corner and hers cost about the same as a small and it was way smaller. Don't forget to bring cash!

They're very generous with the meat here and they piled it onto my platter so high that I couldn't even use the to-go cover I asked for because it wouldn't close. Another bonus is that you have unlimited access to their sauces and you better believe I doused my plate with their delicious white sauce. Be careful with that red sauce as it is S P I C Y. They also have a bbq sauce that no one ever seems to talk about as well. Best street food vendor hands down!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"I had heard a ton about the Halal guys food carts. There is always a line at these locations and finally I wanted to find out why.

My wife and I came on a weekend and no surprise to us there was a line. There was also a wait because they seemed like they were restocking their ingredients and cleaning. They cleaned the grills and some were getting things prepped. Not sure what was happening but this helped their marketing because the line grew a little longer.

I went with the combo platter and the beef gyro. The beef gyro was the best thing I ate. The pita was perfectly steamed and the gyro hit the spot. I would reorder the gyro.

As for the combo platter it wasnt the best platter I have had. The rice didnt have the same flavor as other places. The meat was a little overcooked as well. It also has a little bit of a weird flavor. I couldnt pinpoint what it was but it didnt sit well with me. The other issue is the yogurt sauce that comes on it. When you get it to-go they give you packets. It is more like a ranch than a yogurt sauce. The hot sauce that comes with it is really hot. I would be very careful putting too much on. It is painfully hot.

In the end, I am not sure this place lives up to the hype. I get better food from other discrete food carts. They have the name recognition but the product doesn't deliver. It isn't bad but not the best in NYC.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I've been coming here when they first started out but now since they branched out, I don't think it's all that great. The white sauce doesn't taste the same either since it's more packaged than in a bottle. The portion size is good but for the price, I'm not too sure about.

I won't go out of my way for it but since my cousins are here from Chicago, they decided to try the original (where it all started) but they also said it's all the same.

I wish it was like the way before. The only plus size is Halal Guys have more than 1 food cart now (3 today).",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"While I was in high school I would always go to a Halal Food Cart to get some quality lunch. It was convient and cheap, especially if you were a student. It was right around the corner of my school and there would usually be a long line of people waiting to buy. All my friends would also go just because it was the tastiest and cheapest food we could get in the area. I would always get the lamb over rice with white sauce and barbecue sauce and it's the most delicious meal I've ever tasted. 10/10 would recommend to others.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"The originators. None greater.

There's nowhere else on the planet that you can get Halal food that tastes this good.

You might wait an hour or two, depending on what time you go, but that's the price you're gonna have to pay for the real thing.

Always trust the food card that has a line that goes around the corner I was city block and has been in business for over 15 years.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Update:  stopped in yesterday to grab some dinner and in less than a year(?) they raised the price from $8 to $9 for the combo platter..  has the taste changed? Nope! You still get the same portion and same unseasoned meats.   Of all the years I have been coming here, the taste and portions have never changed .",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Not sure what all the fuss is (was?) about. I've been eating at Halal crts for more than 20 years, which should qualify me to render an opinion, no matter how meager.

Based on my one experience, HG is the corporate chain franchise of street meats. When I walked up, maybe just slightly outside lunch prime time, it was staffed by two guys and there was no line, which was kind of surprising.

The ordering process was gruff and unceremonious, even more so than your average NYC cart experience. If they were trying to get me to return, they certainly hid it well.

I appreciated how streamlined everything was, with almost zero latency between ordering and receiving my delicious meat platter. The sauce packet thing is interesting and appreciated (no Halal man has ever interpreted ""just a little white sauce"" correctly before).

The main protein choice was between chicken and beef (surpriisngly, no lamb?) and I went with the beef gyro. Opted for the smaller portion (again, appreciated). $7 is definitely above market price for a small portion, but maybe that goes toward packaging the sauce or creating the app. Who knows.

Overall, not bad, but I wouldn't choose if over my $6 Halal guy a block away.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,Delicious platters and gyros. Make sure you are going to the real ones and not the knockoffs. Love the white source but be careful about the hot sauce as it is way TOO HOT.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"The hype for The Halal Guys is real! This is the original street cart location according to the nice guys who cooked our food. It's located right next to the big red HOPE sign.

For only $8 you can get yourself a generously sized plate of food with your choice of meat (falafel for vegetarians) fresh off the grill with perfectly cooked saffron rice, a bed of lettuce, and pita bread. Add some of their white sauce (tasted like tzatziki) and spicy red sauce (with caution) to taste! I went too crazy with the red sauce because my lips were on fire, so go easy with it if you're not a daredevil. Food came out super quick and this is the spot to go to get more bang for your buck in NY!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"On our trip to NYC, we had to try the OG Halal Guys! Compared to California's, New York's just tastes better! Something different about it just makes better. Seeing everyone grubbing right next to the cart is a just a good vibe! We walked from our hotel about 10 blocks to find em because while in New York this was a must spot for foodies! Combo Platter drenched in white sauce never disappointed anybody's! Thank you, Halal guys!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,Great food. Cart food but much better quality. Have rice and chicken or gyro or falafel or combo platter. Can get a sandwich option as well. Also have burritos now which is new. The family platter lasted me Sunday to Tuesday and it was about 43 with taxes.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"The street cart known throughout the world! I have been eating at Halal guys since the time they were just one food cart. Now they have restaurants around the world and I was hoping that they maintain their consistency in quality, quantity and taste. I got my usual order of Chicken Over Rice. Earlier they used to fill up the whole plate with rice, now it is just half the plate with rice and half the plate with salad. Earlier their salad consisted of lettuce, tomatoes and onions; now it's just plain lettuce. The rice however tastes as amazing as it used to and so does the chicken. But the packets of white sauce are just not as good as how it used to be. Their white sauce was something that made them stand out from their competitors and they just commercialized it and ruined the taste. Really disappointed!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I've lived in NY my whole life and never got around to trying The Halal Guys and I finally decided to try it now after seeing the reviews.

I got the combo platter and it comes with orange colored rice, pita bread, lettuce and beef and chicken. They give you packets of their own branded white sauce and hot sauce and it is $9 for the combo platter.

Honestly, the dish was really underwhelming. The meat itself doesn't have much flavor, like they didn't bother using any seasoning or salt on it. A lot of the flavor is just white sauce and the meat was really really dry. Hot sauce is insanely spicy, I put a few drops to test it out and my eyes were watering.

I ended up only eating half of the platter before tossing it. I got a bad stomach ache after as well, needed to run to the restroom a few times.

It's definitely overrated but if you're hungry and in the area, go for it I guess.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Oh man, Halal Guys is no longer the cheap meal that hits the spot. They now charge $9 for a platter. In addition, they have two different sizes, small and regular. Like what! The food still hits the spot but that price increased though, not so much. The last time I was here, it was $7. The prices are quickly increasing that I didn't experience the $8 price. The sandwiches are still $6. That seems pretty reasonable. But it doesn't fill me up like the platter. Very soon, Halal Guys will be in the double digits price.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"The Halal Guys were parked on the corner by our hotel all weekend, and I was reluctant to ""waste"" one of my NYC meals because I'd had the Halal Guys in LA and let's just say that I was less than impressed.

Our last meal in NYC, I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad that I did. I don't know why, but it's SO much better than what we have in LA. The meat was more flavorful (and a much more generous portion), the hummus creamier, and the falafel crispier.  It's also a great deal - for ~ ~$20 we got a beef gyro, falafel gyro, chicken shawarma plate and side of hummus. And there were a lot of leftovers after 3 people ravaged it.  I wish the franchise locations were as good, but alas, there's nothing like the original.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"---CASH ONLY---

No trip to Manhattan is complete without a visit to a street food vendor, but these guys are not just a street food vendor... they are THE Halal Guys.

Combo Platter.  more food than a normal human can eat for like $8 and it was delicious. That white sauce made it even better so put some more of that stuff on there.  Don't know what's in it.  Don't care.

The guys were super friendly.  The decor is Manhattan so that's awesome.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I've had the halal guys in CA, but I was in New York, so I HAD to try the original one. It's a stand on the sidewalk, not an actual store. The line was long but it definitely moves fast. I got the usual - small combo platter. And I'll have to admit -- this halal guys was better than any of the ones I've had elsewhere. The meat wasn't dry, portion size was good, meat to veggie to carb ratio was just right. It was delicious! What a great meal.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"The highlight of my trip to nyc. I had the combo plate with beef and chicken and I thought it was amazing!!! Combined with a packet of white sauce and drops of the red sauce, I was eating the best meal I've ever eaten off the street. The white sauce was perfect with the meat, salad, rice, and pita. Some people might think the meat is too salty, but when you add the white sauce and other sides it balances out.

Spicy foods are my thing but watch out for this one. Definitely try a few drops, the extra caution will pay off! Also watch out for fakes on the other side of the street. You'll know you're at the right cart if you see the Hilton letters on the building across from you.

It's also a lot of food that you can definitely share with someone, especially if you plan on heading for dessert after. If that's you, Levain bakery is close and you'll never regret those cookies.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"The Halal Guys is iconic NYC. Everyone used to flock here after a night in the clubs back in the 00's.  The lines were long.  The customers drunk, boisterous and oftentimes looking to pick a fight.  And someone would always wait to buy food for everyone else.  10 combos, extra white sauce please.  

Nowadays, the lines are short and orderly.  Everyone knows they'll get their food.  DH and I were walking to Hells Kitchen last week when we passed Halal Guys.  We reminisced about all the times we ate their combo plate, we had even made it a moving day ritual at one time.  Of course, we stopped in our tracks, skipping out on our reservation and got on line.  We needed to see if the food was even close to our memories.  The line moved fast.  DH ordered a regular combo and I ordered a small falafel platter as I stopped eating meat 2 years ago. Both come with yellow rice, lettuce and pita.  The white sauce was just as good as I remember it.  You need it, the food is a bit dry without it and the hot sauce is as spicy as I remember it.  Use sparingly!!  You will ruin your food if you use too much, in addition to burn your mouth!  Use a little at a time, you can always add more!  My falafel was decent, not the best I've ever had, but the white sauce and hot sauce made the dish.  The small was just the right portion size.

I don't usually eat street meat so don't have a point of comparison.  I can say you should eat at Halal Guys though because it's still the best street meat I've ever eaten!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Being a New Yorker .. how can I not review this New  York tradition !

This is a food cart. Though now, they have multiple branches in the city itself and also all over the country and the world which are not food carts but food joints with sitting space.

Simple menu - chicken (great tasting), beef (even better tasting), pork (not anymore at this cart for some reason - but again is great tasting), falafel (kind of okay tasting) - over yellow over rice. With white sauce (yum - put lots), hot sauce (yum but very spicy. Pro tip- put only a few drops ..it would burn your mouth !!!!) and bbq sauce (good).
This joint doesn't have it but some of them also have gyros and baklava (very sweet but really good).

$7 per plate (was $6 till very recently) - huge portions - would easily last 2 meals.

Open till late. And almost till 4 am on the weekends. Have had many a post-binge-drinking-night-3am-meals here !

Only con - No sitting at this location. So people mostly do a take away or sit on the parapets of the surrounding buildings.

Always a long line but moves quickly. Definitely one of the better halal places in the city.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I'm from California and I've hear my friends rave about Halal Guys. But most of them have only had it at one of their chains in the west coast. This was my first time ever trying Halal Guys and I wanted to do it right by going to the original location and having it served from the cart. Not only was it an inexpensive meal in NYC, they were generous with the portions and it was delicious. Luckily, we came when the line wasn't too long but it got long after we got our meal. One thing that did suck was that there were not tables/chairs. We did find a spot to sit and eat but it was also very cold (we came during winter).",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Atmosphere: Looked like other Halal carts. The menu is simple and easy to navigate.

Service: Fast service! There was no line since we went at an awkward time (10:30 am), but the line looked longer during the lunch rush.

Food: We ordered the chicken and gyro combo platter. Not to be extra, but this is literally the best Hala food (and food in general) that we've ever had. Their portions were perfect, the meat was well seasoned, the rice was unique, and their hot sauce packs a punch!  Everything went perfectly together.

Overall: One of the best food places in New York. Everybody needs to eat here at some point in their life. You get more than your money's worth here and won't be disappointed! We'd recommend beating the lunch/dinner rushes and having a drink to pair with the delicious hot sauce!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"So I've been DREAMING of finally trying the original Halal Guys for years! I live in the Bay Area and have tried The Halal Guys in San Francisco, Berkeley, and Las Vegas. While the food at these locations was delicious, I knew it wouldn't be as amazing as the original location. When I finally got to try the food from the original cart in Midtown Manhattan, I was in foodie heaven!

First off, there are two carts at opposite street corners, so even if there's a line, it moves fairly quickly. These guys are a well oiled machine! There's the main food cart, and there's a grill nearby where a cook is grilling the meats. It's a sight to behold!

On to the food! I ordered the combo platter, which I've ordered at other Halal Guys locations. Let me tell you, saying that amazing food is even more amazing at the original location is in no way an understatement! The food was unbelievable! So flavorful, so moist! Every bite was amazing! This meal was well worth the years I waited to try it from the original cart! I wound up eating here one more time during our trip, lol! And I will for sure be back the next time I'm in NYC!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"Finally, made to the o.g. of Hala guys. The service was fast and organize. One person took the order and the other cooked. All condiments, utensils, and napkins were all in the bag. The plate was $9 something and it was definitely worth it. Better then all the Hala guys that I been to back home. I got the chicken and rice plate. It was definitely tasty.

The Halal Guys,"""Where's the Original one?"" My girlfriend and I are big fan of Halal Guys since it was open in Long Beach, CA and she suggested to look for the original since we're in NYC. She was wondering this question, since NYC and this specific location have bunch of Halal Guys stand on each street corner. You can look travel guides on where was the original one, but frankly they all are original because they're all from the street of the Big Apple. Trust me they taste the same lol.

Of course we ordered their half beef and half chicken platter. Their white sauce really complements the meats, rice, and vegetables. The taste was a little different from the Cali version.. taste gritty and street wise; I love it :) Folks, your NYC trip will be never be complete if you did not taste this yet. Overall, I wish they have Halal Guys stand in Long Beach cause if they do.. just take my money and fatten me up :)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I ordered the chicken and gyro over rice. It was loaded with both meats.  Halal guys does taste different in NYC compared it the store in Toronto; the white sauce is more lighter.

Overall, I prefer chicken over rice from the random food-carts over halal guys since the random food carts are cheaper and the white sauce does a little better!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Everything we were looking for and more at 4 am after being out late! Quick service, and no line. If only there was a nice, warm place to sit there to eat.

The Halal Guys,"After years of hearing the hype I can't believe how much of a disappointment this place was - it was just awful, and nowhere near as good as similar halal food carts like Rafiqi's.

The Halal Guys are so popular that they cook massive amounts of chicken at the same time stacked up a foot tall on a tiny grill, which results in the chicken being steamed by the chicken below it instead of being griddle cooked in its juices/oils, so the chicken is gray and rubbery instead of crispy and flavorful. I tried to compensate for the bad meat by adding the sauces, but the white sauce is basically mayo, and the red sauce is so spicy that all you taste is heat, not flavor.

I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 in case I just caught them on an off day, but please do yourself a favor and go to the nearest Rafiqi's instead of this overhyped nonsense.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I'm not a big fan of Mediterranean but this food truck hit that late night, street food craving we all get! I got the vegetarian falafel with extra of their infamous white sauce that I couldn't stop eating it. Totally worth the walk at the end of Time Square.

The location was the only downfall as it was at the end of the Time Square strip where it was dark with a few bums. It was a bit scary but thankfully I had my friend with me.

For an extra kick, get the hot sauce but be prepared for a fiery finish. The lines get long during lunch, dinner and the late night post drinking time slots but they're a well oiled machine that works fast and efficiently and of course the food is well worth the wait!

The Halal Guys,"Of course when visiting New York for the first time like myself, You would want to come to one of the most popular tourist attractions such as this one. There are many different stands around the Time's square area. Very quick service and there wasn't no line even when it looked so busy.

Very overrated. Didnt know what the hype was all about. Couldn't find anything that stood out in the food. lacked quality as well as flavor. Despite that, The portions was decent. For 8$, you get a platter full of rice w/ a good amount of your choice of meat(beef,chkn,falafel or combo of beef&chkn), 3 pieces of pita bread and a little bit of lettuce.

Ordered the beef platter. Questioned the beef alot when eating since it didn't taste all that. Tasted like meatball and after a few bites, I just got tired of it. Sauces provided tasted like ranch and wasn't sure why people claimed it was a ""special"" sauce. It did help me finish the food though.

I would come here once if you're a firsttimer in NY to check it out but after that, Nah it ain't all that.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys was what fueled my love for halal. Everything about it is just fantastic. It's not too expensive and it comes in huge portions, so its perfect to share with friends.

The Halal Guys,"Been eating here for years.  Yea yea, I know, they've started cooking at a centralized kitchen and the food is delivered to the carts.  And yes, they now use beef gyro instead of lamb.  But there's something special about this cart.  53th and 6th is the place to go and somehow the original location on the Southwest corner is still the best.  It's still the one with the longest line, so it's the easiest to spot.  There must be something about that spot that just makes it taste better.

If you have only had the recently opened franchises, GO TO THIS CART!  The franchises are nothing at all like the taste of a real Halal Guys platter.  There's magic in the air of Manhattan and the taste it not like any other halal cart around.  I swear it's something to do with their sauces being left out in the open all day long.

For $8, you get a giant plate of rice with chicken and beef gyro.  Put as much sauce on as you want.  Be careful of the red sauce though.  That stuff is pure capsaicin.  I usually find a piece of lettuce to put a dollop on and that piece of lettuce is sacrificed.  I take tiny little bits at a time to eat with my plate and then throw away that piece of lettuce so I don't burn a hole in my tongue.

As is tradition, they do not sell drinks.  Walk around the corner to the cart that sells the $1 cans of soda.

This is a New York tradition.  You can't come to Manhattan and not have a Halal Guys platter on the corner of 53th street and 6th Avenue.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Most New York natives you talk to will tell you Halal Guys is overrated. I see where they're coming from - there are plenty of great halal carts throughout the city. But at the end of the day, their chicken on rice is just plain good.

Their serving sizes are great for the price you're paying (you'll probably struggle to finish the regular portion). I like how they let me put the sauce on myself - big fan of white sauce and usually like to douse my food with it. Also, because of how popular the place is, they're always cooking food and there's no wait time once you place the order.

Recommend it if you're in the area, but if you're visiting don't take a huge detour to come here.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

But it was a solid food choice and the price is good!
I got he chicken and beef halal wrap that was good but it wasn't a flavor explosion I was hoping for with all the reviews and recommendation I've heard.

Definitely stop by and make your own decision but it was just so-so to me.

First of all, don't get deceived by the copycats and look this up online.

I was really looking for the lamb but apparently they don't serve that anymore.  I got the combo sandwich for $6 which is cheaper, in California it's about $8 + tax. I like how you can serve your own sauce (maximize that red sauce).  I would recommend putting as much red sauce as you can handle.

The taste is just overall better than the ones here in California. It's a good quick lunch for on the go. Combo is good so you can taste both meats.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"Amazing, delicious, well-flavored food that definitely gives you a bang for your buck!

Perhaps it was the cool NY air, the evening hour with street lights lit and flashing, the hunger in my stomach, or the welcoming yellow and red colors of the Halal Guys street cart, but I quickly became obsessed with the chicken and gyro plate.

On a bed of orange-colored rice were two steaming heaps of meat (I got chicken and the beef gyro), paired with a couple pieces of pita bread, a pile of lettuce, and drizzled with white sauce...you are in for a feast. I split it with my husband. The portion size is phenomenal for the mere cost of $8! The servings of meat were quite large; they didn't skimp at all. The meat was so savory and flavorful.

I wish they gave more pita bread. It was so soft but the portion was oh-so-small. Don't forget to ask for extra white sauce; they'll put some extra packets into your bag! Also, don't read the nutrition label on those white sauce packets. It'll spoil your fun! Just sit down on the nearest bench and savor that lovely goodness.

The aluminum containers they serve it in come with cardboard lids, so you can somewhat easily save your leftovers. They have bottled drinks for sale if you need something cold.

One star deducted only because the employee working the cart was very rude and gruff. Perhaps that's routine New York food cart behavior. Also, have cash. Perhaps that's also common knowledge - and now it's common knowledge for me!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"The world famous Halal guys! This legendary food cart is a must visit for any New Yorker or visitor!! This place was revolutionary and was first on the scene of the middle eastern food market. My group of friends always called this spot ""G-spot"" because every time we went to eat there, it hit the spot. The white sauce is incredible and the hot sauce is extremely hot. Use with caution. You have to try this place, its open late night too although lines are almost always wrapped around the block. It is definitely worth the wait though.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I'm so annoyed and disappointed. Make sure you use PLENTY of white sauce because you will need something to make this bland food edible. Where's the flavor? The oil? The ""this is going to make me regret my decisions later""?

Street meat should invoke a certain kind of ""love"", but I knew I was in for a bad time once I was given white sauce in a packet. The chicken was dry and unseasoned, same for the rice. My food was ready in literally 30 seconds...these folks just want to assembly line people out. I really don't see how people gave this 5 stars when there are much better carts.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,Just as good as the one that just opened in Sunnyvale lol. I usually get the beef gyro sandwich which White sauce and add red sauce on top. Meat is tasty. Have your cash ready!!,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Just ok. Not as good as the great food carts in midtown. But fine, when you need a Halal fix. Get the spicy sauce. That stuff is killer.

This is a good, cheap meal when you have 10minutes, and 10 bucks.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Quality has degraded substantially. Highly overrated. Avoid unless drunk!

The Halal Guys,"I have always wanted to try this place. Every time I pass by, the line appears to get longer and longer.

I finally decided to take the plunge and line up.

The service is great, but I don't know if the food is worth the wait. While I can't fault the food, there is nothing spectacular that warrants the wait.

I'll have to give them another chance, and hope next time it is better.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Okay finally got to New York last month to try out the original Halal Guys on 53rd and 6th.  Yes there is a Halal Guys in Toronto now, but I specifically waited until we got to New York to try the original.  These guys literally own that south west corner in Midtown as the only thing that is going on there are people either serving or customers eating Halal Guys.

The menu is really simple....choose either a platter ($8 USD) or a sandwich ($6 USD).  From there choose either chicken, beef gyro, combo (beef gyro/chicken) or falafel.  Then add the famous white sauce and their fantastic hot sauce and enjoy!  Such a simple concept but utterly fantastic.  Portions especially of the platters are huge and great for big eaters like me.  The protein is tender and delicious with either the rice or wraps but as everyone says that signature white sauce really gives it that distinct taste.  However I was really impressed with the hot sauce....most hot sauces are just too mild but their hot sauce has a serious kick to activate the endorphins in your body!  Both the white sauce and hot sauce comes in separate packets that you put on yourself.

We got there early around 5pm so there was no crowd but I've heard from many on how long the lines can be at the lunch and dinner rushes.

Based on price, portions and taste I can see why there is such a craze for the Halal Guys in New York.

4.5/5!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"So being the 9000+ review is a first.  However,  so worth it.  Don't be fooled there is only one Halal Guys,  you will now you have found the original when they have a line and mountain of meat on the grill and pitas covering it.  There is a guy asking you what you like and taking your Cash payment.   So I got the chicken plate and the beef gyro.  

Let's start with the chicken plate it's the best ever had with their white sauce and hot sauce combined it's a good you dream about.  The chicken and rice and spices with a bite of pita season while cooking and then the nice white sauce to smooth it all over for the next round!

So the gyro another prefect marriage.   I have had many gyro's  in life this one is top two or tied for first.  This place is worth and so is the small wait so look for them.  O and if your in a car just put your hazards on and eat on the side of the road like everyone else!  

Some have said if you don't see them on 53rd they may be on 51st by radio city music hall.

There is a reason they have 9000 reviews and going strong.  The one of the best street car food stands I have found in the US.  Will be back each time I am in NYC.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"This place is a must when you come to New York. I usually order the Combo Platter and it is delicious.

They actually made multiple restaurants of the Halal Guys in SoCal but it does not taste the same. I first ate it in New York five years ago and then ate it in SoCal and was pretty disappointed.  The experience is definitely different eating it at the original location of New York. It just tastes better to me in my opinion when I eat it in New York.

The white sauce is so good and it goes perfectly with the Combo Platter. Be careful of the red sauce because it is REALLY SPICY. I would recommend getting very little or try it before you put it all over your food.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"One of the original locations, this place is always busy but well worth the wait. If you're a first timer visiting NYC this is one of the spots to go. The only thing that I was disappointed is that they don't serve lamb in their combo plate but I think it's all across the franchises so you can't be mad about that.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"When in New York, have to eat food from the street vendors! What everyone tells me. Hahah.

This food vendor was about a 15mins walk from Time Square. After hubby and I did some shopping for souvenirs and gifts, we headed straight there. It was a nice walk. Definitely didn't feel crowded on the way there.
**NOTE: there was actually a closer location to Time Square, but we did not noticed until we were walking back!!! It was behind the HOPE sign.

When we arrived, there was a line. Maybe about 7 people ahead of us, but probably didn't get food until 10mins later, which is weird because food seemed to be done? Lol. Oh wells.

We ordered the Combo Platter to share, which is both beef and chicken with rice, lettuce, and pita bread. They have sauces on the side so you can squeeze for your liking. WHITE SAUCE IS SO YUMMY. I ate a lot of that!! Red sauce - SPICY. So be careful! Hubs love spicy and kept adding more and my mouth was burning. I got mad at him and all he did was laugh at me. Hahah. The food here was delicious! We agreed that the chicken tasted better than the beef and will probably stick with chicken only for now on. Platter was enough to feed us both. Great portion!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,For the price and the location it is good. But there is much better food out there. If you wanted to enjoy the experience and say I went to these guys and got some halal food that's great. But it's there are many other places that can offer better for premium,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Ok.

I am a born and raised New Yorker.

This place is legend.

It's nothing like the other franchise restaurants.

Never compare this place to the others
EVER!

This place is seriously the best.
Nothing tops this place.

Ughhhhhhh. I love this place.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,Halal guys is over rated because the chicken and rice don't have much taste. I say this because I'm used to eating tasteful spicy Pakistani food. However the sauces at halal guys are what really make the food tasteful and different. I absolutely love their white sauce! That's their secret ingredient basically. It is a must try in NYC! I didn't like halal guys in other states tbh.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,"The Halal Guys is one of the most iconic food spots in New York City. Foods that I ordered was some of the best dishes I have had in a long time (maybe even ever).

Also, the price is drastically less than what you would expect for such high-quality, freshly cooked food. The cheap yet good-quality meals had very generous portions considering their prices. $5.00 included lots of protein, rice, and vegetables that kept me full for an entire day of ""exploring"" the Big Apple.

This is certainly one of my go-to street foods. It is conveniently located, and the preparation and cooking are very quick. I rarely have to wait in line for more than 5 minutes.

The only slightly inconvenient bit was that they did not accept credit as payment (I don't know if that was just the specific food truck I went to, but I think it applies to all the Halal Guys out there). However, I recommend having cash on you so you could experience this delicious meal!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"CAUTION...

Hot damn.  Literally...I mean that spicy sauce is no joke.  They actually have 3 sauces you can pick from - a creamy white sauce, a bbq sauce, and of course that super duper hot sauce.  Proceed with caution even if you like spicy.  

I wasn't expecting much from a lil food stand but much to my surprise, it was pretty damn delicious and I'm craving it right now as we speak.  The food stand is so busy that everyone gets their order fresh right off the grill, which is a plus.  I got the combo with rice and I recommend you do too.  

Get in line and get it while its hot.  lol.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,The food is lukewarm at best. The falafel was dry and had too much cardamom. The rice was bland. Meh. Average or below average food. The pita bread was soft and tasty. Prices were good $7 for a falafel plate. I'm SUPER surprised at all the reviews that rave about it. It's a major disappointment and national chain. I didn't realize that. Support local businesses and surely have a better product. This is clearly massed produced and low quality and poor taste,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I'm a nurse and after a long shift I decided to order The Halal Guys through door dash. I've never been big on presentation but I have to say this falafel plate was so pretty. The flavors were incredible. The white sauce, hot sauce and falafels were so good! I will definitely be ordering again!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I had heard so much hype about this place and i was NOT DISAPPointed.
I liked that they had multiple stands around the area so you don't have to cross a specific street if you're closer to one of their other stands.
It was around $8 for a box and let me tell you, it is a LOT of food. I shared it with a friend and we still could not finish it. The meat itself was nice and moist while the rice was a bit dry but they were a nice balance. The spices in the rice was one thing that stood out, some may not like it, but I didn't mind it.
It also comes with their white sauce, i don't know what it is, but it is amazing.
I also put some of their hot sauce on and even thinking about it now my mouth is watering because it was spicccy.
It took me a trip to NY to try it even though they opened one up down on south FL, i'll definitely be going back closer to home!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The Halal Guys,This is my all-time favourite food truck in NYC and you can call it staple food for your stay in NYC or a NewYorker. The food is comforting if you need a blend of both carbs and protein. It is the best street food and most consistent tasting. The white sauce is the best topping. Be aware of the red sauce as it is one of the hottest I have tasted so far. Do not burn your insides without knowing how hot it is.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"NOMZ! Nestled very close to the south border of central park, is this stand. I had to go to this location because of all the wonderful reviews even if other stands tempted me.

I can't wait to come back when I go back to NYC next month.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I think this place got really popular because it's fast, cheap food.
If there's a line, fret not, because the line is always moving fast.
Chicken and rice with some white sauce, you can't get any simpler than that really. It is a good spot for some decent food, but I'm not going to New York to get some chicken and rice doused in sauce. It's not worth the calories, in my opinion, and I'd much rather sit down and enjoy a meal at a restaurant.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"The hype is real. I have spent a lot of time in NY and have never bothered seeking out the OG halal guys, mostly because I try to avoid midtown. Well, I'm staying in midtown for a conference and Halal Guys is across the street so I grab a bite for lunch. I went with the combo platter and the chicken and beef are incredible. The white sauce takes things to the next level, but do heed other reviews about the hot spice being very hot - there's a reason they give you a teeny tiny packet or that and a huge packet of the white sauce. I do recommend using the hot sauce though because the flavor is incredible with it.

Overall - I'll definitely make it a regular spot in my visits. Just be weary of the curb across the street, I saw 3 people do a flip over it in the course of 15 minutes and there would truly be no worse tragedy than losing your halal meal to the streets of New York.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,Overrate! Food is not as it used to be. The guy collecting the money is rude. Rice is way too yellow to be natural. Chicken was bland and beef was dry. I do like that now you can add your own white sauce. Hot sauce is HOT. I  had a few drops and my mouth was on fire. Pita bread is not even warmed up. People feed the pigeons around the cart and it just disgusting. Prices are of course higher than other halal carts but that's to be expected since they'rewell known now. $9 for a reg and $7 for a small.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Now at $8 a pop, it's still rocking my world. The chicken or combo platter is the way to go. The saUCES though. So good. Lots and lots of white, lil bit of BBQ, dash of hot, and thank me later. I'm salivating as I'm writing this review. After you get your food, take a seat with the pigeons on the marble bench/side to get the full experience. You have to eat it as soon as you get it to get the full effect.

It's crazy i know...thousands of great restaurants all around me, yet i never miss a chance for the combo and rice whenever I'm in town.   $8 bucks and you're stuffed...i mean can you do that anywhere in the country, let alone New York?  

I start thinking about this place days before i arrive.  This trip i had a dinner planned with clients at a great steak house, yet i still made it happen.  Wasted dinner was totally worth it

this was the most memorable and worth it of all the food we tried while in NYC, and we've tried A LOT of the popular places in NYC. the reason why is because everything in NY is already priced higher and this is the best value for the price!

The Halal Guys,"Halal Guys may not be the original prototypical ""Halal"" food truck - an americanized take on a few mediterranean dishes served in a stand, but it was the only one to lift this style of food to popularity all over the US. How so?

$ and Yum

I currently live in Austin and I can tell you that there are many other ""Halal"" type establishments trying to make a name for themselves, and after visiting the real one I can literally taste the origin.

There are two types of dishes: one's over rice (8$) and one's in a wrap (6$). The one's over rice are probably the most bang for the buck in terms of overall food you can get in the NYC area. I've Never seen anything quite like it. They fill a large circular container up with their delicious rice, lettuce, tomato, meat, and two slices of pita,  and it is lathered up with their notoriously famous ""white sauce - tzatziki"" and your option of their very spicy but tasty hot sauce. The one's in the pita wrap contain the same things except without rice and in lower quantities.

Pretty much all the meats are tasty: chicken, lamb & beef gyro, shwarma

BUT

In my honest opinion their falafels are to die for - they sell them for about 50 cents per piece as an add-on, so if you're feeling extra hungry.... or would like to combine them with a meat...

I can honestly say that this is a must try place in NYC, pay homage to the halal fast-food gods and you won't be disappointed",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I'm a vegetarian. And I LOVE falafel.

Halal guys is my type of guys.
So halal and so delicious. It always delivers. Always been there for me at the corner when I need it.

I've tried their falafel plate on many occasions and they have never failed to disappoint. The spicy sauce is extremely spicy so beware of that. So hot so fabulous. The white sauce so white and saucy. Definitely be generous in your serving of that.

""What's in a name you say?"" It's always the quality food, you know you are getting into something good. Just simply what you need there when you need it.

Keep on keeping on halal guys.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Nope. Work your way over to the nearby King of Falafel cart and thank me later.  

Ordered the falafel sandwich and it was a hot (lukewarm) mess. The white sauce and flat bread were the redeeming members of the aluminum foil'd sandwich, but he falafel itself was room temp, bland, and to be avoided. By all means grab extra napkins and keep the plastic bag; you're going to need help cleaning up afterwards. My sandwich somehow disintegrated quicker than I could eat it.

Side note: if you're down to melt your face off, try just a very small amount of the red sauce. The warning label is there on purpose and I'm glad I didn't douse my food. Hopefully I'll get feeling back in my face again later today if not tomorrow.  

Cash only BTW.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"Delicious cheap street food! $8 for a huge portion of meat, rice, and lettuce. Don't forget the white sauce!! Heavenly! The red sauce is HOT. I'd give them 5 stars if the rice was better, more moist. it's a bit dry. Would definitely come back. It was worth the wait! Luckily the line wasn't too long so we waited only about 15 minutes.
Note: Make sure you have cash. My boyfriend and I didn't have cash on us but the guy in front borrowed me a $20 bill while my boyfriend ran to the ATM. The last thing I expected to happen in NYC.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

PETTY THIEF

Late night yesterday, the guy that deals with money tried to short change me $10. gave him a 20, and instead of 10 and 1 he gave me 1,1 and moved on the next customer.  I confronted him, and without any challenge he gave me the rest of the money.  You see, there was no hesitation or challenge to give me the rest of the money because he knew he was short changing me, if you made a real mistake, you would think about it before handing over more cash.

AND

he tried to short change my friend yesterday too.

BEWARE THAT PIECE OF CRAP!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"I've heard of Halal Guys before, but I never went out of my way to try it in the West Coast. Thus, the original location is my first time trying them. The food cart located on a busy street near Times Square and there are some public seating available around the area. There are multiple carts, but my friend recommended going to the one with the longest line because that is the best one. We came here around 5pm and the line wasn't too long.

I ordered a Combo plate with chicken and gyro. The classic Halal Guys plate includes slices of pita bread, meat, lettuce, and rice. However, what makes the plate delicious is their white sauce and hot sauce. Mix a lot of white sauce into the plate because that's where most of the flavors come from. As for the hot sauce, it is VERY spicy. I added a bit in the beginning to test it out and then continued adding more as I ate. My friends who had Halal Guys on the West Coast said that the hot sauce here is much more hotter than the locations they've been to. Lastly, the portion size is pretty dang big. I ordered one for myself and I barely finished it. I would recommend sharing it with someone because it's a good amount of food to consume in one meal.

I enjoyed the chicken and gyro plate from Halal Guys, but it isn't something I would consider a favorite food. The meal was great, but I don't crave for it. Also, after eating the bowl for a while, I got a bit tired of it. That's another reason why I recommend sharing it with someone so that you don't get sick of it. Overall, Halal Guys is a a decent place for food, and it's definitely a great choice for a meal.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"The Halal Guys has had a few locations open in my hometown of Chicago but I can now attest they have not a single thing on the OG Halal Guys carts in NYC. There are tons of Halal Guys locations but apparently the cart here at 53rd & 6th street is the best. We walked a bit out of our way to make sure we tried the best!

The hype is pretty legit for this cart. Like I said, I've tried outpost brick & mortar locations in Chicago which were fine...but this cart? It was delicious.

There was a huge difference in taste, not to mention service. We saw the guy working the cart describe to confused tourist clients sizing even though they asked about 50 questions on the topic and one even asked what hummus was. I was standing there thinking, y'all it's a street cart! Order and go! But the guy working was so kind answering with patience everything they asked.

Get the combo platter. Be sure to douse in their magical white sauce. If you like spicy, add a few drops of that, but be warned it's realllllly spicy.

The Halal Guys,"The food was great! But I don't think the price serves justice to it. I spent almost $10 only for the small size chicken.

However, ignoring the price. The food overall was decent. The chicken was cooked well. The rice was a bit dry, not a problem though.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-halal-guys-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
The Halal Guys,"It was okay. My friend took me here. It's not horrible but it's a taste you can imagine. Reminded me of college gyro place. Also reminded me of those college sushi places that use spicy mayo. The white sauce is made with egg yolk and oil, basically a mayo. Be ware of the red sauce! It was way spicier than I thought, my face got so hot in the middle of six avenue. I guess it's worth trying once considering the fame and the price, $7 for small bowl which is still quite big.

Definitely stop by one of their locations for some good eating, especially in this chilly weather. **WARNING - their hot sauce be HAWWWT! Balance it out with a bit of white sauce.

We opted for the Combo platter with Beef and Chicken. It comes with shredded lettuce and orange rice. This one platter was enough food for my wife and I to share.

They apparently made too much money so spent $ on their 2-3 extra food stands that's not open to sell food , only cooking extra meats, also they spent extra money on their sauce packaging and their uniform. They always have a super long line at all time on all days. It's really worth price and taste really good. Their combo is one of the best choice.

The Halal Guys,"My friends since college would hype this place to be the greatest chicken and rice platter you'll ever have. I thought to myself, how can a food stand have something of that caliber. Well, I found out first hand in my very first trip to the City. You know it's the real deal when it's late at night and there's 20+ people in line for both stands. I got the combo platter to try the gyro and chicken with the rice. The money maker as you will year time and time again is the white sauce. Wow! It's literally a sauce that originated from heaven. It really made the dish. As ferociously hot the red sauce may be, it is required to complete this dish. Little drops of this sauce on the platter is more than plenty.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Always been a fan of RHLP and typically visit them a few times during the season (May-September) but in covid-19 times we have to support our (not-so) local businesses. Why?
Because we want them to stick around a bit longer.
Called in my order of 5 classic lobster rolls and 2 Mac and cheeses. Had the lobster rolls deconstructed so they wouldn't get soggy. Everything was perfectly packed and included everything I would need, from spoons, to garnish to separate containers for the garnish.

They have frozen margaritas and rosè vodka chillers to go which I would have taken but I'd probably be too tempted to slurp while driving home.

He ordered inside (only 3 people inside allowed). And it was only a 10-15 min wait. We had our own cocktails on the first real day of summer so the wait was quick. We ran out of ice for our homemade Pimm's and they kindly gave us a cup of ice!

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Don't understand the hype. We went around 3pm and there were a lot of people ordering take out and eating at the tables. I understand that they were busy but the rolls were so tiny and had very little meat. For the price ($26) I expected more. Maybe it was an off day since from pictures it looked like the rolls are stuffed.

Aside from the quantity, I found ""The Classic"" to be lacking in flavor. ""The Connecticut"" was savory and buttery. The fries were golden and crunchy.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Bad service here. We went for lunch and got seated at an unshaded two top. Servers ignored us for the better part of 20 minutes and took the orders for other tables who arrived later than us. They also refused to move us to shaded seating despite one being open, saying that it was ""reserved"". My wife is pregnant so we just called for take out and left.

Some person left a comment saying we should have ordered food to go to begin with since my wife is pregnant. See the third sentence of the above paragraph. That's the problem I have with this place. No issue with being out in the sun for a bit, but waiting for 20 minutes just to be acknowledged is beyond silly. We went to another restaurant the night before and service was on point, so I don't buy this ""we're all flying by the seat of our pants"" stuff. Food is otherwise good, but I'm sticking with my one star review because the service is just bad.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Do yourself a favor and read the not recommended reviews all the way at the very bottom of the page.

Came here when they opened up for phase 2, they had tables spaced out six feet apart. About three larger tables to accompany 4 people and maybe 4-5 smaller tables for 2 people. We came with four people and all the four seaters were taken up with parties of 2 except for one which had like eight people to a table. Fine. What's the logical thing to do? We move two smaller tables together so we can all comfortably eat and still remain six feet apart.

Ten mins later, here comes one of their workers with the rudest attitude ever to tell us that we aren't allowed to move two tables together because they are smaller tables and are meant for two people. Read that again. And now read it one more time. Does that make any sense? They told us if we wanted to take up two tables we could but only if we kept them six feet apart. Where is the logic there? How is it any different than if we had a larger table? We weren't encroaching on anyone's six feet distance. But okay fine, we moved the tables back apart.

Five minutes later, a woman comes out and tells us we didn't move the tables far enough and makes us literally sit with our backs facing each other. At this point when she left, EVERYONE started laughing at them for how absolutely ridiculous this was. So we moved four chairs and uncomfortably ate at a smaller table. Meanwhile it made absolutely no difference since the second table had no chairs for anyone to even sit at.

Food was not bad. The younger girl behind the bar was a sweetheart. Never coming back here though because just wow, literally everyone of their patrons was in shock at the stupidity. I even went online to check the mandatory guidelines and guess what? Nowhere does it say moving two tables together is a problem as long as you're six feet apart.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"I watched the belligerent owner of this business (all the employees identified her as such and apologized profusely for her erratic behavior) chug a glass of alcohol then jump into a car and dangerously speed off to make food deliveries. I hope she doesn't kill anyone, but she's certainly lost my decade-long support.

Full disclosure, the above was merely the straw that broke the camel's back. We drove across 3 boroughs (38 miles round-trip) attempting to support a business for which I held a great enthusiasm for quite some time.

I stood outside waiting. My order was running late. There was no designated outside waiting area. No employees volunteered to approach me, and nobody even bothered to acknowledge me. Finally, I was called inside, I pointed to my dog, the employee directed me (and my dog) to come inside, and I entered (with my dog, as directed by an employee). A woman who had rudely pushed past me multiple times, dismissive and hostile and frantic, began aggressively questioning me. Why would I think it's okay to bring a dog inside? Because I am not familiar with the county regulations, perhaps it was okay to do so when they are not serving food for consumption inside the restaurant, I don't know, but an employee told me to enter (with my dog) so that's what I did. But if when she'd asked me earlier if I was planning to bring my dog inside, I said it was not my intent, why then did I bring my dog inside? Well, because the restaurant was not serving food to customers inside the premises and since an employee told me (and my dog) to enter, so that's what I did.

The real issue here is that everybody was negligent and unaccountable. Someone should have dignified my presence. Since it turned out the irate woman who continually grumbled [as she walked back and forth] at me was the business owner, why didn't she say (1) you can't bring the dog inside (2) can i bring anything out to you (3) did you already place an order or are you looking to place an order (4) can i send someone out to help you (5) i really should put up some sort of barrier behind which customers can wait so the rules are well-established so this unfortunate incident will never be repeated (6) since your order seems to be running late can I bring you or your dog some water? But instead an employee asked me (1) do i want to take my food, for which I paid and tipped, and pretend that nothing ever happened, or (2) do I want a refund, and then just go away and pretend that nothing ever happened, because they're closing, hurry up, choose.

In any other instance, I would have been approached by an employee, I would have been offered some sort of assistance, employees would have tried to be accommodating, they would have apologized for the delay, they would have apologized for the lack of delineation and subsequent confusion; but none of this happened. Instead, it was just WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HAPPEN HURRY MAKE UP YOUR MIND IT'S TIME FOR US TO CLOSE. Heaven forbid them making me wait should result in them having to wait. Heaven forbid they should be inconvenienced after inconveniencing me. Everything on every level was entirely preventable, it all boils down to a dereliction of duty from a drunk boss.

IN RESPONSE TO THE OWNER'S RESPONSE, I was indeed wearing a mask. And I only approached the doorstep, standing outside the door threshold attempting to get acknowledgement from someone, meanwhile my dog stayed OUTSIDE on the sidewalk (while I stood on the doorstep trying to get attention from someone), and we only entered when we (both) were told to do so. Since it is your business, could you not have identified yourself, could you not have sent someone to assist me, could you not have in some way intervened proactively & helpfully? Could you not have used the other door? Maybe you shouldn't have been illegally parked in a bus stop? Perhaps you were too drunk to drive? Did you ask if my very well behaved dog was a Service Dog? Since you're threatening to post pictures of me (in which I am wearing a mask) (hopefully it also shows you chugging a glass of alcohol right before operating a vehicle), can I at least provide an introduction to it? I may appear a bit disheveled after having spent the past two months in bed on the verge of death staving off viral pneumonia and a blood clot in my brain that very nearly killed me. If anyone had bothered asking me why my Service Dog and I were standing so close to the doorway I might have had the opportunity to explain that I was afraid of falling, and my motor functions were off, and I was a bit scared.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Got the twisted lemonade with bourbon cherries (and more bourbon instead of vodka), so yummy. Def recommend! My boyfriend had their lobster roll at a food truck and then we saw this on the Flay List so we went!

Its losing a star for the price. $26 for 4oz of lobster meat on a roll is crazy to me. I would have liked it for $22. $66 a person including tax and tip for an app, 2 lobster rolls, 2 cocktails and a shared dessert. Pretty pricey. We got the key lime pie for dessert. Wish we just walked over to Steve's. Would have been cheaper and better. It was $8 for a little personal pie and we asked for a scoop of ice cream on it. There was like a half scoop of ice cream covered in whipped cream. We were charged $3 extra. Which is insane, $11 for that. I understand charging extra, $1 would be reasonable but they barely gave us any ice cream. I could have went out an got a pint! Any way sorry for rambling on but I'm a snob when it comes to dessert.

I ordered the Connecticut lobster roll. The waiter told me it would be warm and it did arrive lukewarm. Not the biggest problem because the lobster meat was very tasty and I felt like they were fair with the amount of lobster put on the lobster roll.

The mac & cheese was addictive. My boyfriend who does not particularly eat seafood ordered a chicken sandwich. Probably not the best thing to order on the menu because it was just merely OK.

Food and ambience was great and fun as always and the service was excellent.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"My boyfriend and I were seated immediately on Saturday for lunch. The interior was rustic, casual with great music. The staff was friendly.

We started with the DOWN EAST soup which was basically a seafood chowder with a bit of tomato kick. It was very creamy and delicious but I think I prefer the classic New England chowder.

Next we had the FRIED LOBSTER ROLL which was good but I wouldn't get it again. The bold sweet caramel glaze and kewpie mayo overpowered the delicate taste of lobster. It was interesting but if you want to taste lobster, stick with the classic. The side of fries were overly salted. I recommend getting a different side.

For cocktails we tried the Aperol Spritz and Bloody Mary (comes with a fresh lobster claw!). I thought they were both okay but my boyfriend loved the Bloody Mary.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"My husband and I came here on 4th July, after seeing the giant line for Dinosaur BBQ. We were seated immediately, and ordered very soon after  that as we were both ravenous. The servers seemed like they were exceedingly busy, as we tried in vain to get their attention a couple of times, but had trouble waving them down so we could order.
We decided to share one appetizer, and then have separate things to eat. The fried calamari was presented first, and was decent, but I feel like this is a hard dish to mess up.
After this was served, it took a long time for our mains to be served. My husband had the lobster roll, while I had the New England seafood boil. The lobster roll didn't look very good, and this was confirmed once I had a bite. The seafood boil was nothing to write home about, and the seafood also didn't taste very fresh.

I took my girlfriend to Red Hook Lobster Pound for her birthday this weekend.  Our ""unromantic"" lunch for two featured some seriously delicious lobster rolls and a side order of hot crab dip!

We went specifically to Red Hook to try the Poundster, which included lobster, crab legs, potatoes, clams, mussels, corn, and sausage. While it looks huge, we felt that it was a good amount of food for 2 people given the amount of shells that are left over after the cracking is done.

I can't say how much I love this restaurant. For starters every single time I walk into Red Hook Lobster Pound I am welcomed by the sweet smell of the ocean.  

They have two huge tanks full of lobsters that are imported every week from Maine.  Fun fact, somewhat unrelated but makes me love them even more. I was on the BQE(Brooklyn Queens Expressway) getting on the Brooklyn Bridge and I looked to my right and saw the their truck driving north. I honked at the driver and he said they were en route to get the lobsters! talk about dedication!! ugghhh sheer pleasure. Ok now back to the food.

My favorite is the Connecticut Roll, with the East End chowder. The rolls are warm and buttery, and the soup is creamy and spicy. The Connecticut rolls have a choice of side, salad or fries I choose fries. Those french fries are well seasoned, double fried and crispy. They make you want to sing!. The Oysters Rockefeller is a great appetizer and is are large enough to share as is the funnel cake. Both are packed full of flavor, and make you want to shout.

Quick note: I have to say that the interior of the restaurant looks cool. Definitely puts you in the mood to eat some seafood!

We ordered the Connecticut lobster roll and a cup sized new england clam chowder. I have to say that the new england clam chowder was very watery but it was still tasty. I wish it was a bit thicker. I dont know if you can tell from my picture but the soup was like water. As for the lobster roll, it was amazing. The bread was toasted which is a huge plus for me.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Oddly, I marked this lobster place not for its lobster but for its Burger. So naturally, I had to order the burger. My wife ordered the lobster - so we could get a taste of both.

Cutting straight to the chase, the lobster roll is a low return on investment. Its a lot of $$ for a small amount of lobster meat. Admittedly, neither one of us is a connoisseur of lobster meat so we couldn't really comment on the quality of that. But the bread was to die for.  

BUT I strongly recommend that when you visit, at least 1 person takes the burger. It was incredibly juicy. I definitely rate the burger over the lobster meat. There. I said it. And you get 5 stars because thats not even your main dish.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"This restaurant was incredibly dissappointing.

We have a place near us in Burlingame, CA which is roughly the same price, larger, and is much much higher quality.  $26 for something half the size of my fist is crazy, especially with the sheer oiliness of the bun.

The service was nothing to write home about, and the bathrooms make up in design when they lack in functionality.

I was so excited. And this was overall a big let down. I wouldn't return.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Finally visited here after a trip to Ikea.
We had lobster roll which was pretty good. It is pricey-$26, but about right, comes with salad or fries- i had pitatoe salad which was pretty plain. I would get salad or fries next time.
What i was happy about was the waitress telling us it was oyster happy hour- $1 oysters- i ordered 3 dozen- was not too big and was fresh- enjoyed that alot.
The service is pleasant and a very casual ambience- we sat by a window which was nice.
Overall i had a very good experience and will definitely come back.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"First time here last night and it was pretty good. Decided to come here since I've heard good things about them and I was in the area. Ordered a clam chowder soup and the classic lobster roll. The clam chowder soup was really good compared to other places I've been to. They don't skim out on clams either. The lobster roll was pretty good too. Not a big fan of the bread but a decent amount of lobster to fill my belly up! Atmosphere was nice and cozy. Service was great too. Food came out in a timely matter, didn't have to wait too long.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Went here after a Saturday night of IKEA shopping. My fiancé has never had a lobster roll before!! He has a thing about mayo and I told him this place had different options. He ordered the Connecticut lobster roll and I ordered the Fried lobster roll, AMAZING!!! We both tried each other's and they were both so good! Our waiter Mike was so great, he was attentive and gave us some good suggestions when we asked for advice. Haven't had good service like that in a while! Loved his energy.

We ended it with probably one of the best desserts I've ever had, the funnel cake with ice cream and blueberries, honestly will come back just for this! We both still talk about it. Seriously

Frozen Frosé was delightful.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"The lobster rolls here are 5 stars ( better then anything I had in Boston last weekend). Lobster cheese fries are also a worth it.
Skip the clam chowder ( not thick/hearty enough). ..if you go here,  order something with lobster in it.  The bloody Mary had a lobster claw in it.  Great for pictures,  average on the taste.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Recognizing Red Hook Lobster Pound from Food Trucks and Smorgasburg, I was happy to finally sit down and enjoy it.

The menu is larger than I expected which is nice for those who don't necessarily want lobster rolls and they do have a good amount of sharing options as well.

With 5 choice of lobsters rolls (from $26-$28) there's a lot to choose from
   -Classic: mayo & spices
   -Connecticut: lemon & butter
   -Tuscan: basil vinaigrette
   -BLT
   -Fried Lobster Roll
Each coming with slaw, pickle and ether potato salad, fries or green salad.

To start our group of 5 shared:
  -Fried pickles $11: too batter, not enough pickle
  -Crab dip $17: super creamy & the favorite

For entrees:
Everyone enjoyed their Lobster Rolls, 1 friend got the Cobbster Salad $25 which was massive, she said delicious and could easily be split between 2 people.

I enjoyed the meal & experience and while it is pricey, isn't anything lobster related usually?",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"This is a review for delivery only. Food was 2 stars, delivery 4 stars (for being accurate, hot, and timely).

-Lobster Mac: tasteless with lots of overly rubbery lobster (they were generous with the lobster but it didn't taste very good). It's really hard to mess up M&c in my opinion and this was really not good at all
-Fried clams: horrendous and inedible. I couldn't even eat this, it was completely dried up with only a dried breading taste (the sauce was good though)
-Seafood soup: this was just ok, wouldn't get it again

Overall I would never order from here again. I think there are many other places that are 100x better at the same price point- Luke's Lobster, the Kittery, Surfish... to name a few",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"This place is GREAT! It grew from a little wholesale lobster place with a take out stand only, then added picnic tables next door where you can eat the take out food. Now it's a full blown restaurant with so many options and a full menu and bar. Gotta admit, I miss the old picnic table set up. It was kinda neat to buy a whole lobster and just pig out on the picnic tables. There was nothing like it around. A truly unique Red Hook experience. The restaurant and food here is delicious. Prices are obviously higher now because it's getting very trendy. I like it. Fresh, delicious seafood and a full bar with fun cocktails to accompany the food.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"I love Red Hook - reminds you of a little fishing village, like New Bedford, MA. It's pretty quiet, not too expensive, and very hipster. I suggested we pop in here after a little walk & a quick shopping trip to Fairway (one of the quietest Fairway markets in NYC!) Anyway, we arrived on a Sunday afternoon & sat at the bar. The bartender, Candice, was very friendly. I had a glass of NZ Sauv Blanc to start and we ordered oysters, the lobster grilled cheese, with a side and their lobster salad. The lobster grilled cheese was similar to a lobster roll in that the bread was buttery and lightly toasted (yay) and and came with large chunks of lobster. It came with a side, so we went with the potato salad which was so delicious (and really make me wish it was summer!) The lobster salad was very summery - came with big pieces of blood orange & orange. Lots of chunks of lobster in a light dressing. Good experience overall & not too expensive. Very casual place.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The lobster rolls are delicious, this has become my default lunch spot when working in the area. Their sauces are to kill for! The chipotle mayo, I put on anything and more recently the lemon aioli is just simply amazing. The staff is the best and if you have any issues they will definitely take care of you.

Candace always knows which beer I'm In the mood for when walking in. Once they get to know you, they already know what your in the mood for. Also shout out to the lobster clamwich, which has quickly become my favorite.

Also celebrated my fathers birthday here last week and he had a great time and was surprised when the staff and a few patrons sang him happy birthday!

Frozen Margarita - strong and deliciously perfect for a day like this
Fries - Perfect Fries - perfectly crunchy and well seasoned.
Oysters Rockefeller - really well executed with spinach and cream
Lobster Rolls - we had 3 kinds and all of them were good, lots of top-quality lobster meat, tasted very fresh like is was just alive minutes ago and not frozen.

But the bill was $67.00 Then 20% on top for the waiter because it's not his fault. Over all I paid $80 for $40 with of taste.

For my entree I got the fried lobster (which I didn't even know that humans did until I saw it on the menu) and it by far exceeded my expectations.
I wanted to order more crab dip and throw it top of the lobster lol.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"I think every Lobster place I review starts off in a similar fashion: I do not really like seafood. For some reason Lobster and Crab hit a soft spot for me in which I can't manage to stay away.
I am happy to say that for my girlfriends birthday we went to Red Hook Lobster Pound and had such a wonderful time.
Everything about this experience was SO on point. We were seated almost immediately, and our waiter was very attentive all the way through. When we showed indecisiveness about which lobster rolls to get, he asked if we would just like him to have all the ones we got cut in half so we could easily share. It was a nice and great gesture.
The food itself was SO damn good too. The crab dip was amazing - it was honestly the perfect amount of creamy and zesty. It really had the perfect amount of old bay sprinkled on top to make it perfect.
The two lobster rolls we got: The Classic, and the Connecticut were both so juicy and delicious. I honestly love me some lobster and chips/fries, and had a ball here. One of the rolls was doused in mayo, the other in butter + lemon. I almost shed a tear when the end approach each half I ate :(.

I first tasted the roll years ago at smorgasburg in Brooklyn bridge park, it was my first time ever having one, people raved about it so much that I had to try one from the best, and I'm glad I did, I was hooked from the first bite!!! The lobster on the roll is nice and huge, big clumps! They definitely don't hold back! The roll I also love! It's perfect. I have cheated & tried lobster rolls from other places (I won't mention names) and they don't compare to red hook!

The restaurant is cute, seafood theme as expected, outdoor seating is available in the front of the restaurant, the staff is always nice.

The crab dip is delicious! I always order it along with my roll of course.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,One of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. Perfectly done. I had a classic and the Connecticut rolls. Still debating which one was better it's all about preference at this point. You can't go wrong with either lobster roll. The fries were delicious and perfectly salted. The side salad was great and not drowned in dressing. We sat down at the bar and service was super fast and bartender was very friendly.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Horrible service.
My family and friends will never come back here.
We spent over $300 which was expected. It was my Aunt's birthday. We were trying to have a good time and brought our own birthday cake with us. We had hoped they would bring it out with the candle lit after our meal was finished. Coincidentally it was someone else's birthday too. A waiter brought a small birthday cake out (candle lit) for the other table. They yelled happy birthday and people/waiters clapped.

Unfortunately we did not receive the same experience..Not only did our waitress not light the candle, she didn't even bother to take it out of the box for us. She didn't even clear the table. I said to her ""Sorry to be a bother but could you possibly open the box in the back and light the candle for us?"" She said oh, I can ask if someone has a lighter for you to light your candle and I'll just bring some plates out. Her tone and the way she spoke came across as I can bring you the tools but you serve yourself. She didn't even take the cake out of my hands. I replied, um didn't I just watch you guys take out a birthday cake for someone else? Why wouldn't you have one?

In the end we decided to bring it home. Seeing how the customer before us was celebrated and had great service for her birthday only rubs salt on the wound.
On the receipt it says Aubree R was our waitress.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Why 1 star: They asked us to leave as soon as we paid our check. THE AUDACITY.

What happened: my friend and I walked into Red Hook Lobster Pound on Saturday June 15th around 6PM. It was busy but not full, and we were seated immediately. Despite several better-placed tables sitting empty, we were brought to a table at the back of the restaurant which had a dirty beer glass and a dirty knife on it. We had no menus or cutlery or water glasses. Just the dirty cup, dirty knife, and ourselves sandwiched between two loud family groups.

Our waiter arrived and asked if we'd ""like another beer."" We informed him that it wasn't our beer glass, and he seemed annoyed/confused as to why the hostess seated us at a dirty table. He cleared our table and brought us menus, cutlery, and water. We ordered a lobster roll apiece ($26 each). They were fine.

Our waiter cleared our dishes and brought our check, which we split between our two debit cards. He brought them back and we signed our receipts. We were finishing our conversation and preparing to leave when something happened that's never happened to either of us in our dining lives:

The hostess who originally seated us appeared at our table and asked ""Would you guys like your check now?"" We told her that we already paid. She asked ""Oh do you want me to run your cards for you then?"" We again told her that we already paid. She then said ""Oh ok, then do you mind getting up from your table soon? We have a really long wait.""

THE AUDACITY.

First of all, there was not a long wait. There were multiple empty tables in the restaurant, and even if there was a long wait, it is not our responsibility to scurry out like rats in order to make way for the next customers. Both tables next to us had been sitting there longer than us, so why pick on us?

Secondly, even if there is a long wait, there are a thousand better ways to ask us to leave than to send a clueless hostess over to point-blank tell us to get out. We just spent $26 plus tax and tip EACH on a blob of lobster on a bun. Show us a scrap of decency as if we're the paying customers that we are.

Red Hook Lobster Pound needs to seriously reconsider the way it treats its customers. We won't be back, and I'll be telling this story as many times as I can. Is it very ""let me speak to the manager"" of me? Sure. But in this case, I really should've asked to speak to the manager.

I repeat: THE AUDACITY.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Stopped by for lunch in between Ikea and Fairway.  Glad we did!  The fried clams were a step up from the usual, with a perfectly seasoned, crispy shell, and flavorful sauce for dipping.  I had a good cup of New England chowder that was lighter than most, and tasted like dried herbs (in a good way).  My side caesar salad was serviceable.  My husband's lobster citrus salad was full of fresh, perfectly cooked lobster meat, but could have used some seasoning.  I saw about seventeen lobster rolls pass by the table, and though they don't usually tempt me, I have to say that these guys looked delicious.  I will definitely have to come back to find out.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

OUR ORDER:
-Crab Dip with homemade potato chips (Amazing! We practically licked this clean)

-Peel-and-eat Shrimp (Well seasoned with old bay)

-All of the Lobster Rolls: Maine, Connecticut, BLT, Tuscan (ALL delicious and fresh! Not too much mayo / dressing; this came with a side of slaw, fries/potato salad and pickle)

-Chowders (Soooo good and meaty!)

-New England Seafood Boil (The sausage was on point)

-Funnel Cake with blueberries and vanilla ice cream (Perfect end to a great meal)

TO GET:
-Lobster Rolls, Chowder, Crab Dip, but seriously, anything. I had no complaints about everything that we ate. It was all superb.

GREAT:
-Service; our waiter was so friendly and nice. He gave us a free dessert

The ""shares"" for the table are awesome.  Crispy Brussel Sprouts are fabulous as is the Hot Crab Dip.  This is NOT a place for whole lobster; rather, they serve five or six variations of lobster roll, each order comes either with fries or potato salad.  The fries are awesome; the potato salad is the one ordinary thing on the menu that we tasted, but no matter.  The lobster rolls are excellent really filled with a lot of lobster  - more than at most places.  Desserts are outrageous.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Cons -
Parking was horrible to find on a Thursday for a 11:30 am reservation but nothing to do with restaurant.

1-They no longer sell the smashing good sweet potato fries , even the waitress (Crystal H) loved them too.

2-The lobster in their lobster caramel sauce for their crispy brussel sprouts was not very pronounced

3-I believe they should have charged only the difference between regular  price of crispy brussel sprouts ($11) and the price they would charge for fries ($6)  which is $5 instead of $8 additional for replacing fries (regular side that would come with lobster rolls ) for crispy brussel sprouts.

Pros-
1-Friendly service , especially from lady with blonde hair who seemed to be the owner

2-Their crispy Brussel sprouts are quite good and not very sweet (which  I was afraid of  when I read caramel in the Ingredients )

In the middle -
Renovations done from last time we were here in September of 2017....carnival mirrors in bathroom has been removed and now bathroom is much smaller than before  but normal size

Carnival distorted mirrors were put in dining area on walls by tables

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Divine! All seafood tastes very fresh and is not overdone - they really let the lobster speak for itself. There are a variety of lobster rolls to please any palate and other sandwich, salad, and pasta options for the non lobster lovers; for example, the fish and chips is quite light for being deep fried - the fish is white and flaky and served atop a bed of delicious crispy fries. Maine lobster roll has truly just a touch of mayo. Salad dressing was amazing! I'm not usually the person to gush about a salad, but it was really good. Full bar, great casual atmosphere, and very good service! Worth the trek to red hook!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Omg Becky, look at this restaurant! It's phenomenal, I want to eat here every week but I'm not sure my partner would be a fan of that extra expense. The food here taste fresh and the flavors are not overbearing. I got the big pot and shared it with my GF. It was filling for us both. The garlic wasnt overpowering, the flavors married well between the WHOLE lobster and the mussles. The clams and the shrimp were on point as well, I couldn't stop smiling and dancing as I ate. The service here is awesome, our waiter was sweet and very catering. He did very well and was personable. I definitely enjoyed my dinner here.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"One of the better places to get lobster rolls in NYC, although not my favorite.  They do offer both classic Maine style as well as Connecticut style (hot and buttered), as well as a BLT and a Tuscan style (basil vinaigrette) that I've never tried.

The lobster cheese fries and lobster mac n' cheese are essentially identical, expect one carb is fries and the other is pasta.  Extremely cheesy and good for sharing for the table, as they're both very heavy, but sadly there were very few pieces of lobster in either (but are priced at $18 each).

We also tried the fried oysters rockefeller, which was also very creamy, cheesy, and heavy.  

Overall, I would personally stick to the lobster rolls or lobster/seafood boils in the future.  Shouldn't need to cover up seafood with all those heavier items if the seafood is fresh!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I was driving by and the name just called Tumi, I went inside got a glass of wine and seriously the most delicious lobster roll I think I've ever had in my whole life! The place is not fancy at all supercasual very small the service was extremely friendly and by far deserves all five of the stars I gave it the lobster roll was $26 and worth every penny and every bite !!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Absolutely Awful. Fried lobster roll had an Asian flavor profile which is not at all what I wanted nor expected from a seaside-themed seafood restaurant. It overpowered the lobster which was completely overcooked. The fried pickles we entirely inedible. They were watery on the inside making the coating fall off everywhere. The waitstaff has had extremely poor training.
I seriously haven't had a meal that bad in a very long time. Thank goodness!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"there are times when I'm ok to wander out for food, and when I do, it tends to be a food crawl.

Came here after a few food stops and as full as we were, still found ourselves unable to stop picking at the food here.

Red hook tends to be one of our favorite places to grab a lobster roll, but it's not a bad idea to order some sides and make a full on meal of it.

The down side is the price point of these things, but overall, I'd say it's worth it as a treat once in a while.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,So I took my wife there last night Saturday February 8th it was pretty busy with one waiter who was overwhelmed and did a great job the drinks was great I love my drink and my wife loved her wine the food is pretty good I had my mouth set on the lobster rolls classic one it was okay we also ordered some food to take home like the lobster dinner the only thing we got was a lobster nothing else and a seafood pasta it looks pretty good overall it's a pretty cool spot as for my lobster dinner I paid for a dinner and only got a lobster it is what it is but it's a pretty cool place overall,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Easily the best Lobster Roll in Red Hook. I got the Connecticut roll and it came out within 10 minutes and was cooked and buttered perfectly. They also have an awesome lineup of local and New England beers (I had the Sixpoint, freaking delicious) plus frosé drinks which are perfect for hot summer days.

The only thing better than the food was the service.  Our server, Candace, was running orders out to tables and pouring drinks at the bar but she still made time to check up on us and conversate with a smile on her face. Overall a great lunch experience. I'd recommend the Lobster Pound to anyone who loves seafood and good vibes.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"I love Ikea but the best part about leaving, is fresh lobster rolls right around the corner.

They have daily specials and all of the lobster dishes are all made with fresh lobster. I have the Crispy Brussels Sprouts covered in Lobster Caramel Sauce (Bangin). Clam Chowdah is a must. And had a Connecticut Lobster Roll that was just about perfect.

The spot is really chill and they had a few tv's to watch the game on.

Bartender was really cool too!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Came for the lobster rolls.
Taste: delicious, the lobster meat was pretty fresh and meaty and the bread was great too.
Price: $26 for one roll. too much.

While the lobster roll tasted great, $26 is too much to come back here again. Go to luke's lobsters or elsewhere.
Maybe the other foods here is more worth it",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Ordered 4 dinners for my wife's birthday and picked them up. Chowdah, 2 classic lobster rolls with fries, Cobb salad with shrimp and 2 lobster dinners. Everything was ready when I got there at the requested time and the order was complete with no omissions. Horrible going in there when it was so empty because if you've ever gone on a nice spring or summer evening it's really jumping! Anyway, the dinner was a surprise and my wife was thrilled as were the rest of us as we ate our dinners. The chowdah was excellent and the lobsters were terrific, especially the whole steamed lobster. Really sweet and juicy, clearly fresh. I truly recommend ordering a nice dinner from RHLP and give them some much needed support so they will also be able to serve in house once this mess is over.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Since opening, we've come to Brooklyn, either to catch up with errands or shop at IKEA. And always made sure, to grab Lobster Rolls to take home (most times, they didn't even last the long trip home) or have dinner here- because we knew they were just that good.

Sat at the Bar on our most recent visit and went for a 'Fall Sangria"" that was highly recommended and tasted nothing of what people might associate Fall with: the Cinnamons, maybe nutmeg or something with a 'warm' hint. Zero. I drank the thing anyway.

Went with Lobster Cheese Fries and got real excited just thinking about that triple play: Fries+Melty Cheese+Lobster= I'm All Over It! But it didn't impress me at all: bunch of fries, really good cheese that melted fine. Lobster? Puh-lease. Those fries were a joke- ate all the cheese and left behind flat pieces of lobster the size of my pinky nail. What a freaking tease, man.

Of course, Red Hook's Lobster (Buttered) Rolls have always been their showstopper. But I'm sad to say, not even those tasted good. Lobster was very chunky with awesome lumps-but were tasteless. But I get it...things don't always remain the same- things change, the way in which people prep these Lobsters have changed and I'm almost second-guessing Red Hook's, ""straight from Maine"" Seafood quality.

Despite of it all, I'm not dismissing Red Hook just...... yet. I think there's some potential still and somewhat looking forward to a next visit.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,OMG FRESH FRESH FRESH!!! This was my first time eating here after driving past it so many times.  We were on our way home from Fairway and said lets check it out we were so happy we went  in.  Food is fresh  and amazing I had the connecticut lobster roll and my husband had the blt roll with lobster chese fries.  The place was quiet and empty relaxed atmosphere we will be back.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"If you don't want to drive up to Boston this place Is the perfect spot to grab a traditional lobster roll. I'm not terribly fond of lobster rolls but I wanted to try the place out since it had some decent reviews.
I started with a bowl of New England style clam chowder and it was very good. It had lots of clam meat and the cream wasn't overwhelming. It was silky and flavorful. For second appetizer I ordered the peel and eat shrimp. They were boiled shrimp served with a wedge of lemon and a nice helping of old bay seasoning & cocktail sauce. Finally, the Connecticut lobster roll, I was impressed with the size of the bun..it was perfectly toasted with a 70/30 ratio of lobster meat to roll. Finally a lobster roll with the right proportions! It was somewhat bland but after a squirt of lemon it was fine. It was served with a pickle, side of coleslaw and potato salad. For dessert I ordered the banana pudding. It was great and big enough to share.
Parking was easy to find, being that it was a Wednesday they didn't have a wait and they had some great specials like happy hour with $1 oysters and $25 lobster dinner (Wednesdays)I looked around and almost everyone had an entire lobster on their plate;Served traditional boil style in a basket with red skin potatoes and corn on the cob.
There was a full bar and they have some pretty good homemade sodas. They have a great playlist but unfortunately it was so loud that everyone in the place had to talk over it..let's just say it was the equivalent of an elementary school cafeteria lol",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"So I went here the other day, Tuesday (9-24-19) for what turned out to be a surprise Dinner for my up and coming birthday and was pleased. Before coming here, I had seen this restaurant on television a few days prior on one of the food networks and mentioned how I would like to go here and so to me surprise, ended up here. Now I would advise before going here to make reservations because even on a Tuesday night, this place gets crowded to where a line is waiting outside of the establishment. Due to not having a reservation, we had to actually wait until they gave us the option to eat outside where a few tables were available. One of the things that surprised us was how attentive our waiter was towards his customers, he really showed interest.

Enough of that, you want to know what we had and here it is. We ordered the Connecticut which is a Buttered Lobster Roll which comes with a few different side options such as fries in which I chose, a Baked Potato, Spinach and others. The Lobster Roll was pretty good but it comes only buttered and not with the Mayonnaise and celery and other goods that you are used to seeing on Lobster rolls. We also had the Crab Dip in which we saw on the show was well liked and highly suggested but unfortunately when we had it, it was first too salty to the point where we had to have our waiter take it back and when the new one came around, it lacked Salt and a bit of flavor and the chips it came with was wrong for it due to it being too burnt and with Old Bay Seasoning. Oh well, I guess you win some and you lose some. We had these fried Oysters with Spinach on top which was an interesting mix together which was only OKAY, not the best and probably due to the Spinach being too strong. The Star of the night and the last dish that we had was the 1.5 Pound lobster which was Huge for a 1.5 pounder and even could have passed for a 2 pounder. This Lobster was cooked perfectly and tasted great and BEST OF ALL WAS FRESH! A lot of the times when you go to Seafood Restaurants, the Seafood doesn't always taste as fresh as it should but here, that wasn't a problem. The lobster came with potatoes, and sausage in which we had the option in adding. The Sausage in which they used was good too.

As for the price, this place isn't cheap so if you are looking for a cheapy but goodie, this isn't it! These items plus 4 glasses of wine ran us to about 150.
Overall, I'd definitely go to here again and on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give it an 7.5.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"This place has gone down hill. I celebrated several birthdays here, but the last one ended it.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"This eatery has been on my ""foodar"" for a while. My honey and I have been known to drive almost to Rhode Island from our NJ home for a lobster lunch. Having a good lobster place 30 miles east, well that's just magic! And magic, the Red Hook Lobster Pound is.

Located in what used to be a pretty sketchy neighborhood, the restaurant is a colorful beauty mark on an ordinary looking street. We arrived early so we had to sit and read our emails and texts while we waited for 11:30.  We were their first customers today so the place was empty. The servers greeted us and, after asking a few questions, we ordered, what else, lobster!

I also tried their New England clam chowder and found it remarkable. Yeah, eating anything but Manhattan chowder in NYC seems sacrilegious, but I'll do my time in purgatory for this tasty dish and I'll order it again and again!

My wife had the classic (meaning cold with mayo and scallions) lobster roll and I had the hot buttered roll. We both loved our orders, making yummy noises as we went. My wife, a fan of good potato salad, had theirs instead of fries. Thumbs up from her and that's a rave. I had their fresh cut real French fries and I was glad I did. Cole slaw accompanies the lobster and it's a different style - less mayo, more vinegar? In any case, it's good.

They have 'root' sodas - whatever they are - and my wife had a blueberry flavored drink that she liked but after a sip, I  passed. Instead, their lemonade was my choice and it didn't taste like it came from a powdered mix. It was tart and good. Halfway through, I added tap water (from the frosty bottle offered as we were seated) and it still had a good kick.

We ended our meal by splitting a key lime pie (From Steve's) and having just had Balthazar's take, found theirs equal in every way.

This is a local gem. A bit out of the way for public transportation but easy parking for cars on an early weekend.

I added photos of their menu and wine/beer list for reference. Prices reflect the quality - meaning fair...

Our bill with a 20% gratuity was a smidge under $100. A bargain when you consider the high quality and location.

Highly recommended for lobster fans. We'll be back with friends. Hope to see you there soon.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"That's one damn meaty LoBSTaH Roll!

Seriously, that was one of the most stuffed pieces of buttery soft crisp breads I have shoved into my mouth in a long time. Utterly delicious lobster, so fresh, and cooked just right. So tender and melt in your mouth at the same time. Orgasmic.

Oh yeah, start off with the yummy fried clam strips and down them with a cold craft beer from their full bar. Foreplay.

Plenty of seating inside, patio seating on the front sidewalk, terrific service, and funky decor clean bathroom. Pure pleasure.

A bit on the pricey side but should be expected when eating seafood of this quality. If it wasn't so much of a hike to get to from the UES I might be here more often.

A must visit to enjoy life in all it's gluttony when in the Red Hook area.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"BuzzFeed helped navigate several of my dining choices during my trip to the Big Apple, and my favorite was Red Hook Lobster Pound. Definitely off the beaten path, RHLP was a bit of a hike since we had chosen to walk it. But is was so worth it!!

We were very lucky to get sat as quickly as we did since we were only a party of two. The people right in front of us were quoted a 30 minute wait for their party of 4.

We were sat literally next to the food prep area, so we could see through the glass as they made the dishes.

Our appetizer of crab dip was phenomenal. Our LOBSTER ROLLS WERE SO INCREDIBLE!!! I wish I had been able to eat even more!!

I am glad I wasn't steered in the wrong direction and will definitely go back next time I'm in Brooklyn and craving lobster.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"My husband and I came here for his early birthday celebration since it has good reviews. We ordered the Maine event, which might cost more than ordering individually or saves you a few dollars depending on what you choose. We did the Maine event which comes with one appetizer, 2 cups of soup or salad and 2 entree. We did two different soup, the new England chowder wasn't anything special but the down east chowder was different. We got the fried oysters which wasn't bad either. The disappointing part was the lobster rolls. I got the Connecticut and my husband got the classic. The Connecticut is suppose to be with poached butter but I did not taste anything. There was no butter taste or paprika, definitely lacking spice and flavor. My husband got the classic and he said it was okay as well, also not much flavor. He said the best thing was the pickles and fries. Overall, for a $100 dinner, it was just mediocre and lacking flavor. I prefer burger & lobster or Luke's lobsters. I am not sure if we went on a off day but probably wouldn't give it another try.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Strolling through the neighbor and came across this joint so we entered and the scenery is quite interesting. The menu was convincingly simple. I ordered the Connecticut lobster roll, New England clam chowder, and fish with chips. The fish was tender and protein rich. I appreciated the slender strips of each bite of fish. The sweet potato fries were a tad disappointing because they were not crispy nor warm. My lobster roll was average. I was hoping for a warm toasty buttery bread but it was mild. Yes there was butter on it, yes it was a tad toasted but no it was not the drooling bite one takes when eating toasted buttery bread. As for the lobster, it's hard to go wrong with that much expensive protein. I enjoyed the soup a lot but it was heavy on the potato side. I have yet to find a clam chowder similar to Europe. They make a mean ass clam chowder.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I got the unlimited Bloody Mary with lobster claw...yesyesyes it was sooo delicious, not too thick, just the right amount of horseradish and spice very tasty!!!

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"There was an hour wait for a table for 2, so we went inside to wait at the bar and decided to order food there.  We started with the crab dip.  It was delicious with their home made chips.  The lobster roll was so delicious, nicely dressed, tender and sweet on a toasted buttery roll.  It's just heavenly.  For sides we had cole slaw, which was just right, a little crunch, not too much dressing, and brussel sprouts, which was the only item that was disappointing.   They had so much salt on them, they were inedible.  

Since it is all about the lobster here, the bad brussel sprouts did not detract from the experience.

Walked in and a waiter ask us how many guests and directs us to a table by the door. The host comes charging and immediately asks us if we have a reservation (it was early lunch time on a Saturday and relatively emtpy). We said no and continued to sit down.  Looking at his face, it appeared as if we bothered him.  As other guests come in, he does not ask them if they have reservations and gladly sits them down.  It appears he only asked minorities if they had a reservation.  Funny thing is that there's a sticker on the window saying ""we serve everyone.""

We waited half an hour for the appetizer peeled shrimps. The lobster roll looked more like an appetizer although in pictures it looks like a decent size but don't get fooled.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"The food was pretty good but the wait and service was just too slow. We got there at 8pm on a Friday and sat at the bar. We decided to eat at the bar. People around us waited over 20 minutes to get the bartenders attention to get a drink. We got the calm chowder which was warm but not hot. It was very tasty and it was good temp to eat right away but I feel like it may have been sitting in the kitchen a while.

I ordered fish and chips and my bf got the lobster roll. It was super busy so we figured it would be a wait to get food. We waited an hour and 15 min for the wrong order to come out. Two lobster rolls. They took back all the food and we waited another 30 min for the bartender to tell us that the reason the food was taking so long was because they didn't have any potato salad left.. so after two hours we got the correct order. Again the food was pretty good and the portion was fair but I didn't really want to eat dinner at 10pm...

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Deciding between the two types of lobster rolls?

New England = Patriots Fans
Connecticut = Butter

The choice is clear, people.

If you have more questions about what you should order at the Pound, here are your answers:

Yes, you should order the fried clam strips (always excellent).
Yes, you should get a bowl of clam chowder (hearty and a good deal).
Yes, you should also get the lobster citrus salad (light, healthy, and delicious).

Still hungry? You should probably get the BLT Lobster Roll too. I didn't even have to do the math on this one (I worked out the problems above on my own), as the Pound did it for me:

Lobster + Bacon = Heaven",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Good place. Lobster roll was well prepared with good texture. However, for some reason I couldn't make out the complete taste and flavor of the lobster.  That was the strangest experience. The price is $$$ not $$. Good waiting service. The hostess sat us in the front inside and said there is nothing in the back. However,  the back room was empty.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"We dropped in on Mother's Day wanting a lobster roll. Unfortunately they only had the pre-fix menu. It ended up being a pretty decent deal and allowed us to try a few things we likely would have never ordered. We had two types of roll; Connecticut & Maine, the  NE chowder & clam chowder and a few other items.
The rolls were fresh and not overly seasoned or 'chef-ified' which, being a purist from Maine, means a lot.

These are no Maine lobster rolls but they will be able to cure our lobster craving while in NY.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Let's start with beverages. We ordered flat and sparkling water. The server Jordan took the top and trashed my $6 bottle of Pellegrino.  When asked for it he came and said he couldn't find it. He didn't even look for it!  When our appetizer arrived- the fried calamari was too soft. It was sent back to be fried a bit longer.   I ordered The Surf and Turf Burger- tasted more like raw turf, bloody turf. Totally was looking forward to this burger & lobster combination. I asked for the temperature of the burger to be cooked to medium well, and got a completely raw burger!  It was so rare that Iost my appetite and couldn't eat anymore. I was annoyed and was ready to go. I don't blame the server unless he failed to mention the temp when sending the order to the kitchen.  He took it off the bill; however with all the mishaps more should have been done. Training it needed immediately. I should have ordered the lobster roll!!!!

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"When you first step into this small cozy restaurant, you feel as if you've stepped out of Brooklyn and into a small shack in cape cod.
The prices are not cheap, but no surprise here since 1. This is nyc and 2. You're at a lobster joint.
We got the $75 meal for two- which includes appetizer, two cups of soup and two lobster rolls.
The New England clam chowder was thin and slightly watery. Normally I like a thick and heavier chowder. Despite this, we mustered the courage to continue in our culinary journey here.
The lobster rolls were out of this world good. They went light on the mayo and heavy on the lobster. Roll was not too buttery or greasy, and romaine at the bottom of the roll was a nice addition. French fries were also done surprisingly well.
While the prices aren't cheap, if you come for the lobster rolls, this place is a slam dunk and you won't be disappointed, just wouldn't recommend the New England chowder.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Worked up a decent appetite while at the IKEA in Red Hook. Just so happnened to pass by Red Hook Lobster Pound. I've tried their stuff before at one of the food festivals in Manhattan and it wasn't all that. Benefit of the doubt, maybe it wasn't as good as it could have been because it was off site and not their restaurant. Anywho...I gave them another shot.

Decor: exactly what you would expect from a lobster place. Wood everywhere. Pieces of boats decorating the venue. If I had to label it I'd say a nautical meets Cajun bayou type feel...if that makes any sense.

Service: about as pleasant as you could ask for. Smiles and hellos from the folks you encounter. They didn't have to go menus so the waitress let me take one of their regular menus to the car so my wife and I could glance over it. That was nice of her.

Food: when at a lobster place, I do my best to make sure I try several items that sound appetizing and also won't break my bank. With that being said I got the fried pickles, the Connecticut (lobster poached in lemon and butter served warm and topped with paprika and scallions), the fried lobster roll (fried lobster tossed in lobster caramel with kewpi mayo and scallions), the old bay chicken sandwich, and a lemonade.

- Fried Pickles: probably some of the best I've ever had. Chunky, crunchy, juicy, flavorful pickle nuggets. Might be my favorite item out of everything ordered.

- The Connecticut: wasn't impressed. Chunks of lobster (that didn't completely fill the bun), hints lemon and some butter. Nothing special. The bread was nicely toasted though.

- The Fried Lobster Roll: better then the Connecticut in my opinion. Huge chunks of fried lobster with a bit of sweetness from the caramel. The bun got a little soggy towards the end but that could have been because I didn't eat it soon enough. I would definitely order this again.

- The Old Bay Chicken Sandwich: Anything with old bay in the name is usually something salty that tastes like crabs. To my surprise, it wasn't. You taste the old bay but it wasn't overpowering. The chicken was a little dry but the dryness is slightly offset with the pickles and tomato.

Misc.: I've heard sooooooo much about this place and for the high prices they charge, I was expecting to be blown away. Sad to say, I was a little disappointed in the end. There were other things i wanted to try but i definitely wasn't looking to pay in the $100 range for some finger foods for 2 people. I did like the variety of their menu but i don't know if that's enough to bring me back there...unless someone who's pallet I trust recommends something that I haven't had. Otherwise, my thoughts of Red Hook Lobster Pound will just be...""meh""

Until next time.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The seafood boil + lobster add on is pricey but worth it for a special occasion...SO much food, and all of it delicious. The best deal of all is the $25 lobster dinner night on Wednesdays: a giant lobster with corn, potatoes, and slaw. Really yummy!

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Having heard so much about the Red Hook Lobster Pound, I and one of my friends switched our annual lobster roll outing from Fairway to Red Hook. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly and the service is welcoming. The New England style lobster rolls we had (mine with salad and my buddy with fries) were well made and tasty. In fact the only thing that was difficult was the parking which certainly was not the Pound's fault!

So you are now asking...if everything was so good, why only 3 stars? Well, as nice as it was, I did not think that the lobster roll was worth $25 when a similar lobster roll at Fairway is about $12 (both places give you coleslaw and the Pound also gives you a side which Fairway does not) nor $8 better than at the Brooklyn Luke's Lobster. So while I enjoyed the lobster roll, I have evaluated them as just an ""A-OK"" based on value compared to their competition. But if price is not a concern, or if you are willing to pay a bit extra for atmosphere, I think you will really enjoy eating here!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Red Hook Lobster Pound surpassed all my expectations and the Down East Chowdah was one of the best soups I've had this year.

-- On to the specifics

Came here after my fiance and I passed it on the way to the Brooklyn Crab. He really wanted a lobster roll and Brooklyn Crab did not scratch that itch for him so we ended up coming here the next day. I was put off at first at the prices ($25 for a roll) and wasn't actually going to get a lobster roll but once his arrived I had second guessed my decision.

I ordered the fried lobster roll but the one I received was extremely salty, I was extremely disappointed and hadn't eaten all day so I ended up sending it back to the kitchen. I was apologized to profusely by multiple members of the staff and it was explained someone got a little heavy handed with the salt. I was asked if I wanted something else and ended up ordering the roll my guy had(Connecticut Roll). It was delicious, super meaty and tasty. They did not charge us for any lobster rolls. The fact that the staff was super diligent and apologetic made this experience THE BEST experience I've had at similar places in Brooklyn.

Food was dissappointing. I think Jordan Lobster Farm in LI is still my favorite. Started with the New England clam chowder and it was very mediocre at the least. Fried oysters Rockefeller did not have much flavor. The creamed spinach on its own was very underwhelming. Now, the BLT and classic Maine lobster rolls were a let down. BLT has a Cajun mayo which was barely on it. The classic doesn't even barely have a touch of mayo. It's almost nonexistent. The portions of lobster, however, were big but the flavor was just not there. Tasted like it was boiled in water and just threw the pieces on a slab of bread. The fries were over salted, the slaw was disgusting and the potato salad should have been skipped. $90 bill for 2 people for that kind of quality is disappointing.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Server came over, and we each ordered lobster rolls (at $20+ each) which included a side of coleslaw. Food arrived a short time later. Lobster roll was very good, but very small considering the price. And after our food was served to us, our server practically disappeared and we hardly ever saw her again after that.

Also, the restaurant is rather small, and we were seated right next to the bathroom. It was kind of annoying having people waiting for the bathroom standing right next to our table watching us eat.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I was tempted to order a bowl of clam chowder as well, but considering how heavy the lobster rolls and the sides tend to be, I was deterred. The food came really quickly and was delightfully presented. We pretty much scarfed down our meals because we were so famished! As much as I enjoyed mine, I was very close to stealing my friend's roll off his plate and replacing it with my own. It was soooo good!! I'm definitely ordering the BLT next time I'm here.

I came here because many articles listed Red Hook as one of the best lobster rolls in NYC...this verdict is questionable to me.

But I will say that up until now Red Hook Lobster Pound has my favorite NYC lobster roll. Not cheap at $25 a piece, but they have a healthy amount of big chunks of lobster. You know what you're eating. It isn't a mystery. I usually eat both styles (Connecticut and Maine). I've also had their oysters Rockefeller and they are very good too.

One issue is I asked to take an order to go but was advised I couldn't although no where was it noted it was a dine in only special. To get the same thing to go would have been $50.

At $25 each, the best thing on the plate was the pickle.
Everything had seasoning that was WAY off. Fries had no salt- none. Lobster salad on the roll was only lobster and mayo on a bed of lettuce- badly needed paprika, celery salt, something (who puts lettuce on a lobster roll?!?!) and cole slaw got easily 10 times more black pepper than it needed. I will admit, I'm really really miffed that the lobster roll had lettuce on it, as it accounted for about 1/3 of the volume of the total roll.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"After my trip to IKEA, I decided to forgo the amazing meatballs served at IKEA and try Red Hook Lobster. It was a good decision as I was delighted with the service and the atmosphere plus there was no wait time.

I started off with the cheesy lobster fries; the fries were loaded with five different cheeses and it was a melt made in heaven it needed more lobster in it ; none the less it was very good.

My next choice was the Caramelized lobster Brussels sprouts, the Brussels sprouts had a sweet and nice grilled taste - fantastic !!!! My final selection was The Connecticut lobster roll -all I can say is wow the bread was buttery but not soaked with butter and the lobster was coated perfectly not overwhelmed with mayo. I will be back to try the rest of the menu as I'm wide open on Red Hook Lobster .",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

A delicious fabulous 1.5lb. Lobster, with small whole .potatoes and fresh corn... The lobster was amazing. Lobster full of meat..not one empty anything. Rustic, atmosphere, very friendly service. Excellent prices",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"I am sad to leave this review because my excitement to visit this place was overwhelming.  I had a great final class at school and wanted to celebrate with two of my favorite things to do, trying something new and having fresh seafood. This location was my top choice since it was in Brooklyn, leading me to believe it was the original location.
The staff was very friendly, seating us immediately allowing a choice of seats, inside or out.  the decor was cute and coastal, the vibe, laid back. Bottle of cold water on the table, with glasses, was welcomed.  I ordered a classic roll with fries, a cup of clam chowder (at the suggestion of my waiter, I didn't know which to choose).  My friend got a crabcake sandwich with potato salad. The chowder was FANTASTIC!  The flavor was great, full of potatoes and tender clams, broth just the right texture, silky.  This was a great way to start a meal!  Too bad that is where it pretty much ended.
My roll was s.a.d. (soggy and diminutive), and the fries were ok, but dusted in cracked black pepper.  The meat- droopy, rubbery, damp with a thin slippery substance almost at room temperature, had a ""less than fresh"" flavor, atop wilted lettuce pushing the slimy Lobster pieces upward.  The volume was laughable (less than kids scoop of ice cream,  not the 4oz it touts), obviously, since the inside of the 4"" gooey bun was sliced aiding in the meat placement to look ""full"", decorated in green onions and paprika.  Note: I am aware of the  ""-ember"" months approaching and the molting season has begun, but this was all together different in texture.  I fought through the flaccid lobster meat with a fork and knife (SHELLS in my first few bites) after attempting to lift a crisp yet soggy inner/bottom roll, simply because i was so hungry.   The coleslaw and pickle were super vinegary and acidic, not like citrus acid either.  One bite of each and it was over.  I ate the fries until they were cold and drank most of the second bottle of water to wash away the impending queasiness from the main course.
My friend said her sandwich was good but much smaller than the already less than average sized bun.  Her coleslaw and potato salad were also very vinegary, which which e even more peculiar for her sides.  She ended up with a cup of that sumptuous chowder to fill her up and get her palate back on track.
Check came quick without asking, I'm sure because obvious we were not ordering any thing else.  I doubt a return this far out of my way for a subpar meal an outstanding cup of soup without drinks and a tip for $40.  I'll just get chowder by the truck if I see it.  You know,  I still tipped slightly above average(18%) due to the polite service and left much like the roll... sad.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"I came here to try the lobster roll after having a very disappointing lobster roll experience at another establishment in NJ. When I arrived, I discovered that the lobster roll was priced the same as a whole lobster dinner on Wednesday and since you get more lobster meat in the whole lobster that I'd have to do that.

Freshness was good. Lobster was steamed right. Service was very friendly too. Highly recommend.

Check out the bathroom too. It's very ""beachy"".",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Well done on them being popular, though its offensive at how expensive it is for such a small amount of food. $28 for a small roll with lobster and a tiny cup of coleslaw and some arugula.
The lobster roll itself had a few pieces of lobster, and wasn't too tasty.
Waited 30 mins to get our meals once we ordered.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"Spring has finally arrived . My allergies are in full force but nothing can stop me from heading out to taste some delicious lobster in one of my favorite hoods in Brooklyn - Red Hook!
As we were walking over to the restaurant we spotted a guy who looked like he walked straight out of the Peaky Blinders set. He had the coolest black suit an equally spiffy shaved haircut . Whoah!
My day kept getting better.
Sorry back to Lobster!
We entered the bustling restaurant and were seated immediately at the back. Shortly after our orders were taken. I don't like messing around with claws and such so opted for the readymade Connecticut Roll . My grubby kids on the other hand love handling and playing with their food so it was natural that they requested the whole lobster.
So we ordered them a 1.5 pounder and got 3 toasted rolls in addition so they could assemble their own sandwich. My husband got the Lobster bouillabaisse. My sandwich arrived and I took one bite and was disappointed as it was on the cold side. I didn't want it heated up as it was already pretty well cooked . My husband assembled the kids sandwiches and they pretty much ate it in 30 seconds! It was a unanimous vote for freshly cooked whole  lobster which you did a diy Assembly. Husband gave the Bouillabaisse a nod of approval too. Service was a clear 10 Stars! Every 10- 15 mins our server walked over from afar  to scan if we had everything we needed without being too intrusive . Yay to Red Hook Lobster Pound!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"This is such a cute little seaside style restaurant nestled in Red Hook. Felt like I was on a vacation or something when I walked in. I'm not a big fan of lobster, but my husband was craving a roll, so we popped in. Again, I don't like lobster but that roll was something else. The lobster tastes fresh, the bun was buttery and toasted and the lettuce fresh and crispy. It was amazing. I also enjoyed that hey had a bunch of other non-lobster foods on the menu.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"This place has been on my bucket list since its tiny storefront days. But you see, in between that initial spark of curiosity and my finally getting here, I visited a magical land filled with tender, sweet lobster.  A land where even an uninspired Lobster Roll, in the inimitable words of Larry David a la Curb Your Enthusiasm, tastes ""pretty... pretty... pretty... good."":

Okay, so as you may have already guessed, I wasn't a big fan of this spot's Maine Lobster Roll.  In fact, it made a mockery of my happy lobster filled memories.  The bun wasn't toasty and buttery. And small chunks of bland lobster were dressed in a watery, equally flavorless mayo.  All of this conspired to create a soggy bun and c'mon, who wants that?

Hubby had better luck with his Fish & Chips.  A veggie special of charred Brussels Sprouts with some sort of sweet 'n savory caramel sauce was also respectable.  

As per usual, we neglected to make a reservation, and since this place was packed on a Saturday night, we wound up sitting at the bar.  Thanks to our friendly bartender and a nice, laid back vibe, it was all good.  Except maybe the food.:(

ps  Ty to the Yelper who mentioned that a la carte Lobster Rolls are available if you ask.  If you go this route, it's *only* $20.00.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"This place is darn good. Though I have to point out the prices are too high for the frequency I wish I could consume their Lobster Rolls, especially compared to CT, RI or ME pricing.

Anyway, I haven't had a bad item on the menu here, and I'm always happy to go. Service is friendly, fast, and the food has always been fresh and tasty.

It does help to get a reservation if you're going with more than 2 people for dinner because there's not a lot of seating - and they do take them unlike many trendy places in the area - so you should plan accordingly if you're not from the neighborhood... because, let's face it, Red Hook is not the easiest place to get to for most New Yorkers.

If you haven't had their Lobstah roll, you're missing out. Go get one warm with butter, the way it's meant to be.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-hook-lobster-pound-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Red Hook Lobster Pound,"This is a great establishment with lots of room and lots of options! I'm sure that I could eat through every single menu item with much glee and satisfaction. However, just trying it for the first time, we (wife,child, me) shared the classic.
-Having lived in Maine, that's the default for comparison. CT rolls do exist there (see Red's) - also delicious. -
Anyway, the roll was very good. If I could change something, maybe all lobster/mayo. A little seasoning is OK, but without the lettuce. Fries were fantastic. I didn't love the slaw, but my wife liked it.

Also, I am on the fence about the combo meal being the only way to order the roll, as opposed to just a roll.

Qualms aside, great, fresh lobster and tons of great options in a great spot. Just great.*

We sat at the bar and were greeted by a very friendly bartender. I splurged on the Lobster Claw Bloody Mary, it is pricey but that is to be expected for a drink with crustacean parts hanging out of it. It was really good. Treat yo' self and get one.

I had the chowder and the amount of clams in it was impressive. My chowder snob Maine squeeze (patting myself on the back for my clever New England pun) approved, which should be taken as the highest compliment since he is from ... Maine.

We split the lobster mac and cheese. I never order it in restaurants because it is always disappointing, but I had a feeling it would be great. I was right. It is perfect and there is a lot of lobster in it.

Red Hook Lobster Pound,"I've heard the lore of Lobster Pound for quite a long time so it was somewhat of a relief to finally check it out. As a native New Englander, I take matters of chowder and lobster with utmost seriousness.

I was surprised that stopping by on a Sunday evening around 7 was a dicey move - we only got a table for 4 because someone else failed to show up for a reservation. It dwindled down from there, but I will definitely be reserving in the future.

I wanted to test my three favorite dishes to see if the reputation was really warranted - clam strips, clam chowder, and of course a classic lobster roll. The strips were a hefty serving and made a great appetizer for four. Its rare to see them seasoned with anything in the batter, so the old bay flavoring was nice and made them zesty.

The clam chowder was pretty great too. I always have a hard time finding good chowder in the city but this made me feel pretty close to being in Cape Cod. I'd come back again just for a bowl  (or two) of the chowder.

And the lobster roll. The meat was plentiful, tasted very fresh, and overall the roll was great. I'm not sure I'd always shell out the ~$25 for a roll every time I went, but the other seafood was still more than enough reason to visit Lobster Pound over and over again.

Wild Ink,"Had a lovely meal for two here in the Hudson Yards mall overlooking the Vessel and the Hudson River. We had a 5:45pm reservation, but we were running a little late, and when I called to let them know, they told me that they have a 15-minute grace period for lateness. I arrived by 6pm, and was promptly seated. They also let me check my coat and work backpack and gym bag for free in the closet behind their front desk.

While waiting for my dinner partner, they kindly served me a glass of Pernod Absinthe, which I was pleased to see was available here. It was roughly a 1oz serving.

To start with appetizers, the octopus and dim sum platter were the best parts, and we enjoyed it.

The fried sea bass did not live up to expectations. It just felt overly fried and breaded, and not sufficient meat.

My dinner partner was quite annoyed by crumbs brushed on him by our waiter at one point during the dinner and made a fuss about it to me. Other than that, we had a great, lively conversation, and it was wonderful to enjoy good company over good food in a beautiful setting.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-ink-new-york?osq=restaurants
Wild Ink,"TLDR: Fantastic views, incredible service and expensive. It will work for a business lunch that you're expensing. If you're on your own dime, there are better options to be had.

Came here with a colleague to give it a try. The space is beautiful, probably one of the nicer views at Hudson Yards. The concept here is Asian fusion, the website calls it East meets West. They offered both tap or sparkling complimentary, nice touch. Our server was incredibly attentive, knowledgeable and checked in with us at the right times.

We opted for the business lunch ($29) with some supplements and the Dim Sum Platter. For appetizers we got:

Yellowfin Tuna Crudo - Very small portion. It had a light sear on the edges and sits in this soy sauce vinaigrette. There are some baby figs that compliment the dish well. Seasoning was a bit bland and the cut of tuna could've been better. I'd expect it to be better at an establishment like this. Every slice had this sinew that made it quite unpleasant.

Seared Spanish Octopus - This was cooked very well but the char was more than I'm accustomed to. Blackened to the point where some bites were very bitter. The smoked paprika sauce it came with was enjoyable, it also had quite a bit of heat. Probably a bit too much for someone with a low tolerance.

Dim Sum Platter - This seemed to be a signature item. I did not enjoy this. Three different types, two pieces of each; not a lot for $22. The Shrimp and Bacon Siu Mai was very plain. I'd have expected more bits of a bacon but my piece just had a slice of bacon laid on top of the siu mai. It was basically a slice of bacon fat. Seemed kind of lazy and wasn't sure where they were going with this. Foraged Mushroom Dumpling, decent. Mapo Tofu Dumpling - this did not remind me of mapo tofu at all. Other than the tofu, nothing made me think of mapo tofu.

Entrees we ordered were:

Black Angus Bavette - Decent but was just a steak basically. Nothing special. I enjoyed the watercress salad more than the meat. Thankfully I saved the sauce from the octopus and dipped my slices of steak in that.

Artic Char - Was not a fan of this. The skin wasn't crispy, the fish was very small, the bottom of the plate was way too oily. The potatoes were at the bottom to rest the fish so those also become quite greasy.

So while the set lunches were on par with the other restaurants in Hudson Yards, I didn't feel like I got much value here. The food was relatively mediocre for Asian fusion. The service was good enough and the fact that the dinner menu has different items, that maybe I could give it one more shot. Bottom line though, didn't feel like the quality or value was there.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-ink-new-york?osq=restaurants
Wild Ink,"Absolutely amazing meal. Such unique flavor combinations, lovely plating, great service, and the interior was so nicely put together.

Food 5/5
We ordered one business lunch and the dim sum platter. Because it's an Asian fusion restaurant, the dim sum had funky colors and tasted great. I especially enjoyed the shu mai, as it was the right amount of umami and the texture was tender and chewy. We also had the Thai chicken wings, which had a really nice char and sauce. The Japanese risotto was great too! I love mushroom and there was a lot of mushroom in all three dishes haha.

Service 5/5
There's nothing much to complain about, the waitress was nice and they seated us immediately.

On my recent visit, I was at the restaurant for lunch. First we had a few appetizers - lobster and shrimp dim sum was very good. Yellowfin tuna crudo was delicious too.

The food was really good both times. The grilled octopus for the win! Banana Leaf Sticky Rice, black angus bavette, lamb dim sum are all good options!  We didn't really like the upside down pineapple cake.

Wild Ink,"I had my engagement party here on NYE and the manager, Charles, and his team was super helpful & professional. They were very accepting to all the changes we wanted to make during the tasting.

We wanted to have a family style dinner, so guests were able to try out different dishes. Charles and Peter, the head chef, wrote a menu for us and we came in for a tasting. The food was great, but there were couple things we wanted to change for our party, and Chef handled it very gracefully. Most of the chefs in the city would not be as nice while guests are criticizing their dishes. But Chef Peter was very patient with us and did the changes to make the dishes much better.

On the day of the event, Charles and his team was very professional. They made sure glasses were not empty, food was served hot and fresh, the service was spectacular and the food was amazing.

Since we almost ordered the whole menu, and there are some off menu items which was served. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND their lobster. It was so delicious that my guests till this day still talks about the lobster and the sauce. It's very different from the lobsters you get outside. The sauce is a soy bean paste, and Chef Peter really knows how to use the Asian spices!!

As for special diet, they are very understanding and considerate. They have a range from vegetarian and vegan choices. Couple of my guests have special diet- ie citrus allergy, nut allergy, shellfish allergy.... the list goes on. And the manager and servers were so accommodating and everyone was full and satisfied after dinner!

I LOVE their speciality cocktail - it's a whiskey based bee's wax drink, similar to the gold rush. But they are doing a winter specialty cocktail now, and the Mexico one is really delicious. Philippines looks really nice, purple & blue, and tastes like you're back on the beach. Pairs has a very nice tall glass rimmed with brown sugar, it's sweet and strong at the same time.

All in all, I highly recommend coming to Wilk Ink even tho when you're not throwing an event. The price is slightly higher, but the quality and quantity is solid, they don't skimp on the quantity like Zuma or Nobu. I also see that they do a lunch set for $29 for 2 courses, comes with complimentary sesame ball dessert ( it's so good!!!) . I would highly recommend coming here for a date night or even to just stop by for their drinks!

Wild Ink,"We decided to visit the Vessel so booked this place to try out. However what made our dinner immensely unpleasant was that we had to wait from 5:30pm (our reservation time) to 6:15pm-ish because they had a private event in place. They should've disabled the appointments for that time, if they are unable to seat us. When we were finally seated, they gave us a glass of champagne on the house to compensate us for the wait, which was a nice gesture, but did not make up for our unpleasant wait.

Food wise - we ordered a variety of dishes from the menu across starters, small plates, main plates and desserts, including Yellowfin Tuna, Crispy Calamari, Beef Tartare, and Duck 'a la kumquat'. The dish sizes are relatively on the small side, and were mediocre in terms of taste.

My favorite out of all dishes is the Duck 'a la kumquat' - the meat was tender, and was interesting mix with the citrus from tangerines / oranges. The yellowfin tuna was also quite tasty and fresh - the tomato pieces went well with the fish pieces. The crispy calamari is your average dish at the bar, and the beef tartare was also just ok.

We also got a dessert Roasted Pineapple Upside-Down Cake, which was just ok, and tasted a lot like carrot cake. So if you're a big fan of carrot cake, you should get this dish.

Overall dining experience was mediocre, service and wait time was a huge disappointment and I personally think there are better options in the mall across the floor.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-ink-new-york?osq=restaurants
Wild Ink,"Loved our dining experience at Wild Ink! After a fun and exciting day in the City, we started at the Whitney and strolled ended the High Line trail to the beginning to take in the Vessel and find a spot for dinner. My photographer friend David insisted on taking some shots of the Vessel from inside the Mall at Hudson Yards, so on a whim we decided to try out some ""mall food"".

Upon entering Wild Ink, this was not going to be a mall dining experience! Sweeping views of the vessel and the Hudson greet you as you enter the dining area and the interior design is striking and bold, but comfortable and pleasing.

We started with some simple apps, Steamed Edamame and Crispy Calamari. Anyone who has edamame on a regular basis knows it is an uncomplicated dish that is super easy to get right or get wrong, and Wild Ink got it right. Perfectly steamed, with just the right amount of salt coating the outside. The calamari was also very nicely prepared, and we enjoyed just visiting and relaxing after a long day.

For myself personally, I had just had an amazing ice cream sandwich on the walk up the High Line, so I was not looking for a particularly big entrée and settled on the Crispy Mapo Tofu Dumpling Dim Sum. The dumpling was perfectly prepared in the dipping sauce flavorful, however I was glad I had had an ice cream sandwich and was not looking for a big dish, because this portion was pretty small but full of flavor.

My only other comment is that I find myself sometimes searching Yelp looking to find that perfect little spot, or the away place that no one else has found yet, but in this case Wild Ink was a great choice for a spot that was right in the middle of a big mall, and accessible to everyone. Try out Wild Ink, you will not be disappointed.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-ink-new-york?osq=restaurants
Wild Ink,"Super late review (sorry). Visited on April 13, 2019

Located on the 5th floor of Hudson Yards, with a large, oval, marble bar in the middle along with a large wall filled with different type of wine, floor-to-ceiling windows, and leather seats. The place definitely has a bit of a scenery, especially when you're overlooking the Vessel (I like to call it the honeycomb) and the Hudson River.  

It's definitely on the expensive side and serves Asian inspired food. The food was great (but of course expensive) and the service was superb. I definitely appreciated the manager coming over to check-in on us; ended up having a great conversation!

I would definitely return to try other items from the menu and maybe sit by the window :)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-ink-new-york?osq=restaurants
Wild Ink,"Great spot in the Hudson Yards area. Its the go to place for after work with fun music and amazing cocktails. The staff here is also what makes it amazing. Ousmane and the team behind the bar is amazing and fantastic! The cocktail menu is something worth checking out and exploring. When me and my friend were there, they had a dj spinning live, which created a fun vibe!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-ink-new-york?osq=restaurants
Wild Ink,"I just wanted to give an update to my review as my first review was based off of my first visit at opening. Since then I can say that I have visited wild ink somewhere around 15-20 times. The Management and staff are very welcoming and make you feel at home. The Management is very hands on and do whatever they can to speed orders or make things easier.

They did just completely change the drink menu which I'm not too happy about. The Mezcal Crusta was my absolute favorite drink in existence and theres nothing like it at all on the new menu. The Bartenders are really cool and don't have a problem making little specialty drinks if they can, so thats a huge plus. On the downside of the bar, sometimes when its even just a little bit crowded, its really hard to get a drink. Because the drinks are so complicated and have lots of ....accessories I should say?"" they take a while to make. So it may take a while to get to you based off of the amount of people at the bar. Or I could just be really impatient because I'm so thirsty? I dunno

The interesting things about this place is that the nights when it has the most atmosphere and is lively is weeknights. Its gives more of a trendy , hip business dining experience. Overall still a very good restaurant that whomever I bring with me end up falling in love with.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-ink-new-york?osq=restaurants
Wild Ink,"Food: 4/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Value: 3.5/5

Definitely make a reservation, the wait has been 45 min to 2 hours on weekends for dinner. Walking through the entree-way unveils the massive windows with a view of the vessel. You're lucky if you get seated there. If not, it's still a beautiful place to eat.

The menu is Asian fusion with flavor descriptions coming from all over Asia. It mostly delivers. Is it worth it? Maybe... it's not a place I'd come to often but if you're feeling spendy ($100+ pp) and want to impress someone (especially from out of town) it's not a bad option.

Cocktails (4/5): Lost in Translation was really good, Mezcal Crusta was a little light on the booze.

General Tso's Sweetbreads (5/5): pretty damn tasty, if you've never had sweetbreads before this is an excellent way to try them. Crunch and glaze are on point.

Bulgogi Beef Puff (4.5/5): topped with an aesthetic zigzag of ""beer cheese"" you can't be mad at a buttery puff pastry with tender beef filling. 3 to an order.

Curried Lamb Momo (4.5/5): shaped like mandoo or korean dumplings with a thin translucent skin, not thick like a momo is. The filling was surprisingly tasty and not gamey, full of umami. 3 to an order.

Celery Root Yakitori (4/5): loved this vegetable dish of smoky celery root cubes over pureed celery root. This was really creative and fun to eat. It was just slightly underseasoned. The biggest portion yet.

Roast Chicken (3.5/5): a bit boring. The peanut sauce was flat, the chicken and cabbage underseasoned. These would be easy fixes though, so I hope they add a little flair to the dish.

Upside down Pineapple cake (4/5): exactly what I wanted to finish my meal. A satisfying intensely flavored cake with glazed pineapple slices. The ginger ice cream was really strong and very melty plated next to the warm cake.

Our waitress was very helpful with recommendations, a little hard to find at times. Plates were brought/cleared efficiently.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-ink-new-york?osq=restaurants
Wild Ink,"I was in ally local bar in queens and decided I wanted to be spontaneous and try a new place. Took a cab to the vessel, and went inside the building behind it which had this restaurant inside. The restaurant was a bit hard to locate inside the building and was on the 5 th floor or something. Than God for all the Chanel and LV stores to keep me distracted on the way there.

The staff was attentive and polite and so sweet. I tried the dumplings with squid ink and the lobster. Good food the lobster was a bit on the sweeter side which I didn't like much. The skirt steak was basic. Now the chicken wings with the lemon leaf smell. OMG I was obsessed. I can eat these all day! Please try if you go!

Was it a good experience? Ofcourse! Would I go back? Probably not. With those prices I can get a better restaurant experience.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-ink-new-york?osq=restaurants
Wild Ink,"I normally don't care for Asian Fusion places because they aren't Asian, and there is more confusion than fusion.  However, this place is okay if you ignore the price tag (Why anyone would pay $82 for Peking Duck is beyond me).   They definitely know how to use asian ingredients and spices to hone their own taste, which is sophisticated.  We started with the small plate octopus and the mushroom dumplings.  The servicing of octopus was relatively reasonable by NYC standards and it was well prepared.  As far as the dumplings are concerned, Shanghai has nothing to worry about - plus they only gave you three dumplings for $14.   We shared the whole sea bass (three people) with sides of fries and pancakes   The sea bass was fried to the point of being cremated, but the side sauces were able to loosen it up a bit and give it a good taste.  

I give the service and general decor of the restaurant and A+.  The servers were friendly without being intrusive and very professional.  Finally, the restaurant has nice views of the waterfront from Hudson Yards.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wild-ink-new-york?osq=restaurants

Safari Restaurant NYC,"I was looking up a restaurant in Harlem to go to before a performance at a jazz club later in the evening. After a quick Google search, I decided upon Safari, as I'd never tried Somalian food before.
My husband made a reservation online for the three of us that same evening. I didn't think that we'd need a reservation, but when we arrived there at 6pm on a Saturday, we were glad that we'd made it, as the restaurant was jam packed. After we'd arrived, one group immediately left, and their table was speedily cleared for us. Only upon sitting, did we realise that the rest of the diners aside from us, were all together, and visiting from somewhere.
We decided to share one appetiser between the three of us, the sabaayad. It was presented shortly after we ordered. The sabaayad was a dish of flatbread, with vegetables atop the bread, and a spicy green sauce on the side. It looked simple in appearance, but was superb.
Our main dishes came out soon after that. I had the hilib ari, which is their signature dish. It consisted of roast goat with basmati rice and a spicy sauce. I don't like to eat goat very much, but Safari's rendition of it was mouthwatering, and extremely tender.
My husband got the mango curry chicken, while my brother had the vegetarian version of this dish. Both exclaimed that their dishes were also excellent.
The two of them had a sweet tooth after their mains, so we shared Somalian crepes for dessert. The crepes were thick and not too sweet, served with honey on the side.
All in all, we had a supremely delicious and satisfying meal, complemented by lovely service. Would definitely recommend and return.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

Safari Restaurant NYC,"Safari is a small Somalian restaurant. The food is a bit pricey but it is unique. My friend and I had the jumbo steak and mango chicken curry. We wanted to order two mango juices, but they only had enough for one so we also settled for a fiimto. I am glad they ran out of mango juice because I much prefer the fiimto which is a berry and hibiscus drink! It was sweet while the mango juice tasted watery. The entrees comes with rice and a side of bis-baas sauce which I didn't particularly like. It is very spicy and sour tasting. The chicken mango curry was delicious and mild. I expected more beef in the jumbo steak. It was too salty. The mango curry was much better.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

My friend and I had dinner here on a weekday and there was no wait time; we were immediately seated in the humble 7-8 table restaurant and greeted by the very welcoming and friendly waitress.

My friend and I decided to share the Sabayaad (first pic) which comes with a large chapatti bread with sauted veges and a perfect dollop of sour cream to add a tangy taste, nicely sized portion for sharing. I had the Hilib Ari (goat) as it is the most popular dish at the restaurant and it held up its reputation! So perfectly roasted to fall right off the bone and spiced with a light spice and savory flavor that I couldn't stop until I picked off every last strand from the bone itself. Both dishes were complemented by a sour citrus-y green dip that was so delicious and lightens up the meat dishes!

Safari Restaurant NYC,"I selected Somalian food as my first brunch of 2019.
Because i wanted to do and try something NEW to me in my life at this New Year start.
I was visiting friend lives in Harlem,
My friend is new to Harlem and we  are always exploring  and researching  somewhere  from "" real Harlem ""

This place looked like neighborhood favorite.
I've never been to Somalia, tasted neither but
I believed this was really Somalian iconic food.

We  picked most popular dish ( they said) Hilib Ari
Roasted goat served aside with Somali Basmati rice and BizBaz sauce and Chicken Suqaar
Traditional southern Somalia dish, spicy chicken stew with aromatic house spice best served with Bariis or chapatti bread

Both taste really good, I can't pick one dish, and
I like to challenge any local flavor and my taste is flexible but  
If you are sensitive with animal flavor, you should pick Chicken or Beef. I meant Goat is bit strong  flavor  such as Lamb.

They considered  to make our sauce mild,
But I wanna try to have more spicy next time!

Additionally the server girl was cute and sweet,
Some neighbor or regular customers stop by to say happy new year to her.
That looked how this place is popular in Harlem. I guess it absolutely is!

Anyway, good experience of unknown food in new year !",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"Eating here felt like enjoying an underrecognized gem in Harlem. Thanks Yelp!
The Hilib Ari is intense. It's robust braised bone-in goat stew served alongside intensely yellow spiced basmati rice: cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, bay leaves saffron... The best bite was a cinnamon stick that I broke open, revealing a lovely column of rice. BizBaz sauce seems like a creamy green chili sauce.
Can endorse the beef sambusa, mango juice drink as well, both excellent. The grapefruit juice soda I though was only okay.
On a holiday (Father's Day) Sunday lunchtime, the owner (presumably) himself manned both front and back of house effortlessly. Great service.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"With so few Somalian restaurants in the city, you kind of have to support the few that are there. Luckily, Safari is damn good. The Hilib Ari was tender and flavorful, served over fluffy basmati rice. For those who are scared of goat, try the Mango Curry Chicken, for juicy chicken that practically melts in your mouth.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"Before leaving Manhattan I told myself I wanted to experience a nice dining experience in the Harlem area. I searched online for, unfortunately not being able to think of anything more culturally sophisticated, ethnic restaurants, and this place came up.

So I drove uptown, parked my car, walked through Morningside Park, and made my way to the establishment. This looked to be the perfect simplistic hole-in-the-wall as the décor was simple yet clearly communicated Somali culture, particularly on the walls.

Getting down to the more important items, I ordered the roasted goat with cardamom rice, that also came with a Somali style sauce, Somali Grapefruit juice (more like a soda), and finished off with Somali tea.

The goat and cardamom rice were amazing! Just loved the texture and flavor of both the goat and the rice. Again nothing fancy. Simple yet exotic. Also loved the Grapefruit soda. Oh and the tea was other worldly with the combination of spices that, I believe included cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, and cloves.

The host was a very nice lady who nicely educated me on Somali cuisine correctly stating that it was nothing like Ethiopian fare, which I also like but have had one too many times to consider unique. I found it interesting how Somalia and India traded back in the day and, thus, Somalia adopted some of the same spices in their cuisine, but is much lighter.

More importantly, I absolutely loved my meal as it was also perfectly filling. All of the items complemented each other perfectly. The host was very nice and accommodating. The establishment is simple, warm, and welcoming. Now all I have to do is convince a friend of mine who wants to come with me on my next trip to the Big Apple, who is more used to conventional American fare, to dine here so she can find out what she is missing out on.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"My daughter had been wanting to try Somalian food since we were given some samples at a part event held by the Somalian community. I thInk this is one of the few places to try Somalian food! It is very different from Ethiopian food. It has more similarities to non-spicy Indian food with the delicious undertones of cardamom and saffron.
We started with beef Sambusa appetizers. Delicious and beautiful in presentation!
We paired this with mango juice and Flimto- we enjoyed both!
For our main dishes, we shared busketh (flank steak) and chicken suquaar- we thoroughly enjoyed both. We enjoyed the Somali bread which is similar to an Indian naan. We ended the meal with crepe in honey and a Somali tea which is like a water based chai. The restaurant seats only 28, so reservations might be needed at dinner. We were fine for lunch.

The beef sambuza is a must, the flavor was so good and the casing was crispy. The chicken one was good but not as good. I had the Hilib Ari and my friend had the Chicken Suqaar. Both were delicious and plated the same way, with basmati pilaf rice and bizbaz sauce which added some really good spice. We also got a side of chapatti (a fried flat bread).

Safari Restaurant NYC,"If you've never experienced Somali food before, you might want to get started here at Safari.

It's a small restaurant with just a handful of seats in the heart of Harlem with warm service, great food, and for being a divey operation, some beautifully plated dishes.

If you go there for one thing, make sure it's the Hilib Ari. It was an incredible roasted goat dish, and upon asking the staff what one item I should order being my first time there, without hesitation this was their response. I also ordered their chicken sambuza which is essentially an African version of a samosa that came with two of the most incredible dipping sauces. A great way to start your meal, or you could feasibly just order a round of these and be in good shape.

Worthy of a destination if you don't live in Harlem, and if you are living nearby, this needs to become a regular addition to your carousel of go-to restaurant options.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"I am so confused about this place. Now that I have been here twice, I can be more confident about this opinion, so here goes.

The most recent time I was here I came for lunch. Walked in the door at 1:00PM, by the time I received my dish it was 1:34PM. This is lunch. I thought the sabaayad was really delicious - complex tasting braised greens atop a nice, fluffy, and warm chapati with a small dollop of sour cream/yogurt. Things took a downturn from there. My entree that I waited 40+ minutes for was lukewarm. The rice grains are these blown out and dried out things, like someone reheated the dish, put it on a plate, but waited too long to serve it. I had a lunch portion of hilib ari, and my companion had the mango chicken curry. It was too bad because things were actually spiced nicely, but the food just felt... not fresh, like reheated. The mango chicken curry was with dried out chicken breast pieces. I think the least appetizing part of the experience is the decor - I don't mind hole in the wall places (see my reviews) but do we really have to eat in the company of 10+ black flies?

I will say that the person who served us both times was really nice and we did get a banana on top of our meal which is great.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

Safari Restaurant NYC,"Much like how different strands of lycra anchored to specific areas influence the ""drape and hand"" of a piece of garment, different cultures stretch their food ways across their neighbors, influencing them in a myriad of ways.  Take Somalia, for instance.  It's located on the horn of Africa between Ethiopia and Yemen - the gulf of Aden to its north leads to Egypt, and on the other side of the Arabian sea sits the Indian subcontinent.  The Italians and the Brits fought a few conflicts over the area, and Somalian cuisine shows influences from all the regions named above.  

So based on that understanding, one can definitely map food experience for a given region back to the points of ethnic influences, recognizing spices here, techniques there.  However, the problem that I have now is...if your experience just seem like a bunch of serious ganking, is it because your assumption of its taste experience did not match up, or is it because the restaurant just isn't all that great?  That's the issue that I am struggling with when it comes to Safari - the only Somalian joint within 700 miles of NYC.  If you want to visit another joint the nearest one is located in Minneapolis.  It's a tiny place, with about 6 tables.  The chef is the server, and on a wintry day, she's not that busy at all.  The menu isn't really much - the appetizer is only about 4 dishes in total, there are 2 suquars (beef and chicken), the hilib ari is the roast lamb stew, and you got a few things like hanger steaks and the chicken superb.  The dessert was supposed to be crepes drizzled in honey.  

So remember what I said about Somalia being a land under various influences?  In the back of my mind I keep thinking that the restaurant might be ""borrowing"" too much from the neighbors.  The $4 grapefruit juice that I had tasted suspiciously like a Grapefruit Lilt from the UK.  My wife's gingery cardamom tea?  Similar to a Yemeni tea with a piece of ginger cut melted in.    The rice that came with the entrees tasted like a biryani.  The bizbaz sauce strongly resemble the coriander chutney ""green sauce"" found in better halal chicken and rice carts around the city (Sammy's in JH or Tariq #1 north of Union Square).
The hilib ari (stewed roast goat) highly resemble the loubia from the Yemen cafe up in Brooklyn, and the chicken suquar seems to resemble a chicken and rice setup.  

Now, it's no problem saying that the food resembles something familiar and delicious...the problem lies with the sticker shock.  Take the hilib ari, for example - it's $18.  Now, the Yemen cafe in Brooklyn charges $19 for the similar Loubia.  Except in the case of the Yemen cafe, once you order a meal they'll give you a green salad with a bowl of lamb broth, a hubcap sized piece of tandoor bread, and the tea is all-you-can-drink and serve yourself.  No similar generosity were found here.  The hilib ari portions are okay (just rice and meat with veggies on a single plate), but not entirely generous.  Order yourself an app and a drink, and it'll be roughly $30/person.  If you consider the neighbors and what was served on the local restaurants (Le Savane, New Ivoire, the former Africa Kine, now at 7th/West 133rd), they usually do 2 things: charge big bucks for a sitdown but toss in some goodies, or go barebones as a takeout counter but keep the prices low-ish.  It felt like Safari started off as a cheap-ish takeout joint appealing to the locals at W116,  but as the neighborhood gentrified they raised the prices to take advantage of the local yupsters.  Now, I am not saying that the restaurant is bad per-se, since I'll need to fly to Minneapolis or San Jose to get more data points.  That being said, there are better and cheaper places in Harlem to get more bang for your buck.  Keep that in mind.  It might taste fine, but it doesn't taste original, and you are paying more for it.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"Safari is an authentic Somali restaurant and could have been transported from Mogadishu.  Expect a long, leisurely paced dinner. The night I was there with friends, the food preparers doubled as waitstaff.  The beef sambuza was very good, but the sabaayad fell short.  The chicken salad was excellent and most refreshing.

The roasted goat, while very flavorful, was more bones than meat.  Beef sugaar was O.K, but the standout was the mango curry chicken.  The spices were mild and blended nicely with the excellent rice.  It appears that all the beverages are freshly made (and very good), which may have accounted for their being served as we were close to finishing our entrees.  

The crepes with honey were just O.K, and the second dessert choice appeared to be the same chapati served flat instead of rolled.

All in all, I loved the atmosphere, the patience of our waiter as he explained the various dishes and the feeling of being in Somalia for the price of a subway ride.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

The proprietor welcomed us during a mid-afternoon lull. Do not expect super-fast service. This is a small family restaurant with all that entails.

Too bad I wasn't very hungry and only tried the dessert (crepe dipped in honey). Yum. The mango drink was also pretty tasty.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"Nice hidden gem find in Harlem!

We were originally trying to drop by Amy Ruth's, but the line there was beyond ridiculous. Someone ended up looking for an alternative on the Yelp app, and this place looked like it had pretty good reviews. I've never had Somalian food before, so wasn't really sure what to expect. The space itself is quite small and cozy. No frills, simply decorated, but clean. The hostess/server was incredibly friendly and stopped by to chat a couple times throughout the meal. I opted for the hilib ari which is a slow-cooked goat dish and served with rice. It was very good, although the serving size was probably just a tad bit small given the price. It's served with this spicy green sauce on the side which was absolutely delicious (have no idea what was in it).

One of the best parts of the place is that it's BYOB! Also with no silly corking fees that seem to plague this great city. There's a liquor/wine store around the corner with decent selection if you didn't happen to bring anything from home.

Pros:
- First (and maybe still only?) Somalian restaurant in NYC
- Friendly/hospitable service
- Delicious food
- BYOB (with no corking fee!)

Cons:
- Slightly on the pricier side relative to serving size

Safari Restaurant NYC,"We stopped here for lunch after finding it on Yelp. The restaurant did not have posted hours so when we walked by the first time the sign said closed but they were really open, they just forgot to turn the sign around. When another place did not turn out we returned and had a very enjoyable lunch.

I got the mango chicken ($16) and the wife ordered the goat ($18). Both were excellent. My mango chicken was sweet but also had some heat at the end, how interesting. We were also given bananas to cut up and add to our dish, and it really brought an additional flavor level and balanced some of the heat.

We started with the sambuzas (2 for $8) that were homemade and so flavorful and light, not at all greasy or heavy like so many at Indian restaurants.

The ambience is quite modest. We were there on a hot day and I was dying from the heat when they saw me dripping away and finally turned on the AC. But you come for the food and it is excellent, so don't let the other stuff get in the way. Service was warm, friendly, and efficient.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"**For delivery only**

Heard this place is tiny so figured getting delivery is the best option. Late Tuesday night, had a hankering for something new; Somalian food definitely fit the bill as a unique option.

Place seemed pretty busy when calling around 10pm, but the person taking the order was patient and friendly. Ordered the Hilib Ari ($18) and the Chicken Sambuzas (2 for $8) to share. Food took about an hour to show up, so was pretty starved by the time it arrived. Sambuzas look like samosas from the outside, but with more ground meat than veggies on the inside. Flavor is fine, though tasted a bit colder than it should have been. The main course is much better, a heaping pile of marinated goat curry served with yellow rice and veggies. The sauce is definitely a win, a tangy hit that went well with everything. Meat is tender, falling off the bone without much problem.

Food here is worth the hype. They were out of beef when ordering so hopefully get to try when visiting in house.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

The woman working there was very helpful and friendly, and chased the kitchen along when I was running out of time and had to leave (yeah the service is a bit slow).  

The only downsides:
* the dishes were pretty similar, e.g. same mixed vegetables with the same spicing in the wrap and with the fish
* it was quite expensive for lunch - two people sharing a (huge) appetizer, with a main course each, drinking water came to about $50 - there are other great places to eat in that price range.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"Two weeks ago I ordered from here and had my food delivered. The biggest mistake I made was ordering via phone instead of an app where I would have recourse if something went wrong.

I spent more than $50. Two meals and four sambusas (beef and chicken). The sambusas were absolutely disgusting and looked nothing like the photos on yelp. The ""meat"" looked and tasted like prunes. The sambusas were barely filled. The portion sizes of the entrees are not worth the money. Barely any food. Lukewarm. And the flavors were off.

When I called the restaurant to complain about the sambusas, I was told I would be refunded. Two weeks later and I have not received a refund. I've called and each time I'm told the manager is not in and the person answering the phone doesn't understand what I am asking. Never again will I order from here. Terrible food.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"A friend recommended this restaurant after reading a great review in The Village Voice.   Our group of 12 people filled up half of this small, quaint restaurant.  The restaurant was small, but we've actually been to smaller restaurants. Nice atmosphere, very friendly (although slow) service. I don't think they're used to serving such a large group all at once.

Ok, onto the food...these were some of the tastiest dishes that I've had in a long time! I loved ALL the dishes but the standout dishes were the Chicken Sambuza and the Mogadishu Beef Sugaar. The basmati rice and Bisbaas sauce (surprisingly in 3 of the dishes) were fantastic! Their Shaax Tea (very aromatic sweet Somali tea made w/ginger, cardamom, cinnamon and cloves) was delicious! I am definitely going to go back  and try some of their other dishes...can't wait!  :D

Here are the dishes we all shared:

Sambuza (Traditional beef and chicken patties made with aromatic herbs and Somali seasoning; deep fried and served with bisbaas dipping sauce) - Both were delicious but the chicken was better.  One of the Fav dishes of the night!

Hilib Ari (Most popular dish - roasted goat with Somali basmati rice and bisbaas sauce) - the only thing that would make this dish better is if they could make boneless goat!  Hahaha

Kismaayo Chicken Suquaar (Traditional Southern Somali dish - spicy chicken stew with aromatic house spice; served w/basmati rice) - another tasty dish but compared to our other dishes, this one wasn't as good.  

Chef's Special Liido (Fresh catch of the day served w/homemade lime zest sauce and bisbaas rub;  served w/pasta saldata) - the catch of the day was King Fish....the fish was cooked perfectly and went really well with the pasta.  Nice flavors!

Mogadishu Beef Sugaar - (rosemary and mimita infused beef sugaar cooked w/vegs, served with bed of Bariis and basmati rice) - Hand down, the Fav dish of the night!  The flavors were outstanding!

Note:  Bisbaas sauce is made of garlic, lime, serrano chili, cilantro and yogurt.,,,sooooo Good!

- Safari proudly claims this is the only Somali restaurant in NYC
- The service is really fantastic, with the owner describing and recommending things
- It is a small restaurant with 28 seats
- Accepts credit cards
- Italy colonized Somalia from late 1800s to almost mid-1900s, so you will see pasta featured in some of their dishes
- Everything comes with their delicious bizbaz sauce, a pale green sauce of lime, chile and coriander.

What we ordered:
- Beef and chicken sambusa $8 - beef and chicken patties that are deep fried and comes with their bizbaz sauce. I love the crispy deep fried outside and the generous filling.  Of the two, I like the beef slightly more.
- Halib Ari price $18 - roasted goat with Somali basmati rice. The goat was super tender, falling off the bone and had complex flavors; it wasn't that gamey at all. I also loved the plumb and juicy raisins atop the basmati rice.  
- Chicken suqaar $15 - spicy chicken stew with basmati rice.  The chicken is diced in small bite sizes, without bones, in a stew that is spice filled, but it's not hot spicy.
- Catch of the day $18 - The catch of the day was king fish and it was pan grilled with a creamy sauce.  It sat atop a medley of cooked vegetables.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"I hope this lovely new restaurant flourishes in this neighborhood. Places like this are one of the reasons I moved to Harlem: ethnic diversity, family vibe, good food.  Instead, the neighborhood is increasingly looking like Williamsburg.  I'll leave it up to readers to determine what that means.

First the only criticisms: if ranking on the food/price alone, I would give this place 4 stars and here's why: I don't believe the 1 ""$"" rating is accurate.  I ordered the Kismaayo Chicken Suqaar with flatbread and a steamed milk tea. For $15 the meal did not fill me up.  I ran out of flatbread quite quickly (had to eat the rest of the curry with nothing) and the portion sizes at other restaurants (Ethiopian, Indian, and West African) in the area seem larger.

Now the many good points. The food was very tasty: tangy, spicy, fairly tender, with a chili-cilantro chutney that was a great accent. The bread looks a little raw, and I had misgivings, but it was actually very tasty, pliant, soft, and went very well with the chicken.  The steamed milk tea (Shaax Somali) is quite sweet (something I hope they can adjust) but very aromatic and tasty. I've been missing good chai near me (I used to live near a great Pakistani deli) and this will definitely give me my fix.  

The place is small but warm. It's casual, but also has an intimacy about it, and the woman who was running it from behind the counter is so kind and put up with a ton of my questions.  Friendly business-owners and staff go a long way and I'm so grateful for this at Safari. Definitely bumped this review up to 5 stars.

I'm looking forward to trying other dishes, desserts, drinks here and bringing my friends.  If they read these reviews, please increase your portion sizes just slightly, and add a little more bread with each meal, and your restaurant would be perfect.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"I pride myself in having tried food from almost every country on earth. One of the few I haven't until now was Somali food. I am glad I tried it here. While neighbors with Ethiopia, the cuisine is very different. Somali food has tastes reminiscent of India and even Italy.

Our first dish was a flat bread with fresh vegetables and a sauce that is remarkably similar to romesco. It was a fabulous starter. The bread is thin and chewy like one would expect from an Arabic laffah. The vegetables were freshly picked and the sauce was extraordinary, in as much as it made me think less of Africa and more of the Mediterranean.

The hostess was also delightful and hooked up us with complimentary items not on the menu. It being the end of the daily Ramadan fast, she gave us (we are not Muslim -- the staff, like almost all Somalis -- are) fresh dates and a fish turnover/somosa. Perfectly fried, not too greasy, with delicious bits of fish and vegetable on the inside.

For the main course I had the goat --- goat in general is delicious and this was too. The flavors were deep, grassy, and the meat was spiced but not spicy. My friend had the mango chicken -- this was very reminiscent of India. The chicken pieces were covered in a mango curry sauce. The color was deep dark orange and the taste on the sweet side with a mix of savory spice such as ginger.

The most surprising of all however, was the spaghetti. The restaurant usually serves their entrees with rice, but they were all out. I chose bread instead and my friend chose the pasta. The pasta was a star. Somalia had been ruled by Italy so perhaps it isn't surprising to see spaghetti on the menu -- but still, who thinks of Africa and pasta together??? The pasta was cooked al dente and in a simple cheese and garlic sauce, like good Italians, they knew not to drench the pasta with sauce but rather to treat the sauce as a condimente.

The sous chef came in to greet us at the end of the meal and in the future the menu will continue to have updates and, hopefully, some more desserts like halwa, beloved by people throughout the Middle East and wider Islamic world.

I certainly intend to make repeat visits.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

We were the only ones in the restaurant, so service was pretty fast, although I will note that we never seemed to have enough water; our waitress would only fill the glasses up halfway, and then wouldn't provide refills unless we specifically asked (even if she walked by and all our glasses were empty).

He was so hospitable & respectful. He even went next door to get us a RedBull bc my friend looked tired.

They gave us complimentary tea & dessert on the house. Food was amazing & I love the tea. I think I'll come back just to taste the tea again. I havent had tea that good since Abidjan.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"Will give this place 3 stars because the food was not as I expected . Having enjoyed Somali food before , this was like a disappointment .
The byriani had too much cinnamon and was pretty dry .
The chapati was the fake Indian chapati . Was hoping for homemade chapati the one we East Africans make ...
Hope the place improves on their Somali dishes ..
Customer service was excellent though",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"I will start by saying I'm not too crazy about ethnic food, I often find myself overwhelmed or just displeased with the eclectic flavors.

I decided I'd give this place a try since I was famished. I had the Hilib Ari, this goat dish was bomb! The flavors worked so well together!! The portion size was good too. The goat was tender and delicious! Not dry at all, plus they put in the right amount of spice so you can actually enjoy the dish.

My group also got complimentary cups of tea at the end and the chef even came out to chat with us, really nice guy, it's little things like this that just add a cherry on top.

You can't go wrong with ordering here...unless you're a vegetarian lol",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

Safari Restaurant NYC,"My friends and I discovered this restaurant on accident. We were thoroughly pleased to learn it was the only Somali restaurant in NYC, especially since none of us had tried Somali food before.

We split a beef dish and a chicken dish and they were both incredible. Generous portions, really reasonable price, perfectly seasoned and cooked. So, so tasty.

On top of it, the establishment was small and homey and the restaurant staff were so sweet and warm. I'm determined to come back for more as soon as possible.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"We visited NYC from Buffalo, NY. The apartment we stayed in was in the area, so we decided to try it. The Hilib Ari was to die for! My boyfriend got the chicken suqqari. This type of food was unlike any other I've ever had. It's a restaurant, but it feels like you are served a home-cooked meal. The hostess/owner was very sweet and welcoming. She even gave us Somali tea to try with our meal. I would eat here again in a heartbeat.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"I went to Safari with a Somalian friend. The food is amazing. Start off with the brilliant sambooza and then head to either have the mango curry chicken or signature goat meat dish. Ask for them to serve it with a banana and add that to every bite. it's the authentic Somalian experience and no one cooks a better, meaner Somalian meal than Shakib, the chef. The spice is perfect and you can taste the effort and love that goes into creating the meal. Also, the place is frequented by Somalians and it's lovely to sit back and watch them enjoy their ethnic food.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

Safari Restaurant NYC,"Isbarmuuto ($4): Somali fresh white grapefruit juice.

Sambuza; Chicken ($5): Traditional Somali chicken with herbs, Somali seasoning, fried and served with Bisbaas sauce.

Hilib Ari ($16): Roasted goat served with Somali Basmati rice and Bisbaas sauce.

Hooyo Faduma's Mango Curry Chicken ($14): Slow-cooked mango curry sauce over grilled Berber Chicken; served with vegan Biryanni.

Busketti ($15): Flank steak marinated in house garlic ginger sauce, served with Pasta Saldata.

The food is phenomenal! The Hilib Ari/Roasted Goat was truly sensational. The meat and vegetables were aromatic and extremely flavorful. Plus, the Somali rice is fantastic. A standout dish - it's easily one of the best things I've eaten ever. I also adored the Isbarmuuto. The white grapefruit was really tasty and it was carbonated! The only thing we didn't care about was the flank steak. The beef was tough and its flavor was completely shadowed by all the other amazing dishes.

You'll find the bisbaas sauce everywhere and although meant to be really spicy, it can be adjusted! We asked for mild and though I could have used a little more spice, it was really pleasant. The flavor is wonderful and reminds me of a slightly creamy salsa verde.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"My favorite African (Somalian) restaurant in the neighborhood. Stumbled upon it when checking out apartments in the neighborhood last spring and was visiting ever since we moved here shortly after. I can't believe they just got the write-up in the New Yorker Table for two section - I wanted to keep it a secret :) I always get chicken suquar with basmati rice - a very flavorful dish - and fresh mango juice. Got delivery once for dinner and ordered what I thought was a hot ginger drink, but it was a weird tasting coffee (with some ginger I guess). I did keep it and drank the next morning, it wasn't that bad, although I guess I won't order it again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"So delicious. We shared the hanger steak (kalaankel) and goat (hilib ari), and the meat sambuza, as well as the crepe dessert, and I had the (shaax somali) tea. The beef was sweet, with peppers, absolutely delicious--and came with a flatbread & fresh (insanely good) green sauce. The flatbread is nothing like the Ethiopian version, and I loved it. The goat was delicious, too. My friend preferred the goat, and I preferred the steak, but we loved both options. The sambuza were yummy--reminded me of South African Indian samosas. The tea was also divine. Went for the first time this weekend, and am already planning another visit--and it's a definite for guests in NYC. HIGHLY recommend.

I highly recommended the Mango chicken. Our host was a white guy from Minnesota and was pretty knowledgeable and gave us good recommendations.

The other dishes we tried were traditional Somali chicken entree and a goat entree. Pretty good, however the mango chicken was standout for me.

The wait for the actual food was a bit longer than expected, but the flavors def made up for it. I  ordered the traditional Somalian chicken stew and a hot sweet tea. IN-SANE. If only I could eat  like this forever...

The chef (who btw was a total cutie-pie) came out and thanked us for dining with him, gave the entire table a round of tea on the house, and even gave us a few ingredients to take home to make the tea for ourselves. Talk about good service!

Safari Restaurant NYC,"We came to this restaurant because of the good reviews in Yelp. No doubt food was very good. The goat curry and mango chicken was good. I did have African food before and this was just ok....nothing to rave about really !

On the down side.... the ambiance was very bad. The Air Conditioner didn't work and it was very very hot and on top of it there was smoke coming from the kitchen which made it terrible. They were playing some traditional music which was supposed to be entertaining but with everything else going on, it seemed like a chaos.

The server was doing his best but he was the only one. The wait for each item took forever.... and in that heat it seemed unbearable.

I think for this standards, the food is over priced. I wish I just ordered to-go instead of eating there......",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

Safari Restaurant NYC,"Amazing marinated meat with very great spices put together! We had the goat cheese (halib Ari)  and chicken with mango curry sauce (Hooyo Faduma's mango cry chicken). Both were absolutely delicious!! It wasn't spicy at all, they give you a side of spicy soft sauce that goes very well with pretty much everything.
Also service was good, fast and the waiter was available to bring a cup of tea. They forgot our samoussa and were nice to offer us one :) !  
Also hands down for the restrooms, very clean, I found it pretty rare to have decent restrooms in restaurant generally speaking so I was very pleased to see how clean these were.
Also their tea is tasty with cardamom, cinamon... help for digestion :) !
Only meeh thing, I asked for half rice/half bread and they charged us for the bread $2 for a single Chapati... that was a little rough (even though it was good). I would give 4* but the quality of the food was too good",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"I'm a MN transplant , a state that has a large Somali population therefore I'm well versed with the cuisine. Having said that, I was excited to try out this restaurant and boy was I disappointed.

The food is not good. No other way to say it. The barris has a nice color but that's it. It tastes horrible and the mixture of spices doesn't work. The cinnamon stick was also stale.

The flank steak is extra tough and wasn't salted. The chapati appetizer is not a real chapati. It's the frozen  paratha they sell at Indian stores. They warmed it up and heaped frozen veggies with a dollop of sour cream. Not worth the $8 they charge for it.

The baasto (pasta) hadthe oddest taste, I've had better at a below average Italian restaurant.

The only decent thing on the menu is the hilib ari (goat stew). Steer clear of the mango curry. I can think of a few Trinidad restaurants that do it better.

Bottom line, don't go unless you're okay with paying through the nose for horrible food and non existent customer service.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

Safari Restaurant NYC,"Safari is an amazing new Somali restaurant in Harlem.  If you've never had Somali food, it's a very flavorful, unique blend of ingredients and most of the meats are stewed for a long time with fresh vegetables and spices.  I LOVED their mango chicken curry, served with rice.  It's a unique combination, but the perfect union of spicy and a little sweet.  My girlfriend had the goat, which was also amazing.  The portion size was huge and I loved the fact that the meal still wasn't heavy and was filled with fresh veggies.  The quality of the food and warm ambiance is this is a testament to the owner, a lovely Somali woman who started this restaurant.

The staff was accomodating since we came early and let us sit there on a busy night. As a byob place it is fantastic especially since the food takes a while to make. It took a while for the waitress to take care of us cause she was by herself. We shared the vegan flatbread appetizer which was out of this world flavorful. The best dishes at our table by far were the mango chicken and the hilib ari, which are both really rich and savory. I had the chicken suqqar and was a little disappointed. The wrap and brisket were good but not distinct and unique like the mango chicken and hilib. Overall I think the food is delicious which is why I am giving it a 4 stars.

The same two damn songs were playing and when we were ordering our waitress said they ran out of a LOT of stuff on the menu. I was cranky and not expecting to be happy. The service was mediocre at best.

But holy smokes. The food was amazing! It completely made up for everything else that was eh about Safari. My boyfriend ordered the goat, which was delicious. The rice with it was great.

*DO... go there for delicious food with hefty portions, service that is very warm and well-intended, and of course, Somalian food.

The overall experience and environment was slightly disorganized, but as it appears to be a new restaurant and service is very friendly, it can be overlooked...especially when the food comes out. We had three dishes, of the three, our favorite was the goat. The curries they have hold unique spices and flavors, Somalian I suppose? Nonetheless, very enjoyable.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"Small, but cozy Somali place in the heart of African Row in Harlem. Besides the simple, yet tasteful decor, the music playlist stuck out to me the most. Chef Jamal, the executive chef, was even kind enough to come out the kitchen and talk about the songs/items on the menu. The customer service was exceptional, which has become a rare thing in this city.

The Fiimto is a house made berry infused hibiscus drink that I strongly recommend. The Beef sambuusa was crispy and paired with a flavorful green garlic sauce. For the main course, I had the Halib Ari, which is stewed goat, accompanied with saffron basmati rice topped with carrots and raisins. The rice reminded me of traditional brown Afghani rice.

The dessert was a bit lackluster, basically a rolled up round bread drizzled with honey. Besides revamping the dessert section on the menu, my only critique is that the portions were skimp for the prices. The Halib Ari was $17, but the portions weren't satisfying.

I appreciated the mix of Indian and East African flavors. As a Bangladeshi, it reminded me of some traditional Bangla dishes, but with hints of berbere pepper.

We shared the meat sambusas which were perfectly flaky outside, juicy tender inside.  Just all around yum. For my main dish, I had the lamb (Hilib Ari) at the waitress's suggestion (she emphatically recommended this) and I was not disappointed.  The lamb was juicy and flavorful, rice fragrant, and the bisbaas sauce was spicy and delicious.  My friend had the busketti which is kind of like steak with pasta and she loved it too.  Couldn't stop raving about how good it was.  We also both appreciated that we had enough food to be full but not disgustingly full.

Our waitress was attentive but not pushy which is the perfect combo.

Heaven on a plate the nice spicy kick of the goat and the mild sweetness in the rice were amazing. The food was cooked well and even. It was perfectly season not over or under.  I came with two friends who brought me as a late birthday celebration. They asked me to pick a location. I decided to pick a restaurant off harlem restaurant week and loved how the food pictures looked for this location. I'm so happy the pictures lived up to the taste. When you first walk in it's very small and intimate and you smell all the spices, it was amazing felt like I was getting hungrier as I looked through the menu. My only concern is that it's in the middle of 116th street next to pretty much just residential building so this gem gets easily missed. Additionally, the bathroom is very small and one of the handles for faucets were broken and they have no paper towel holder/dispenser.

Safari Restaurant NYC,I ordered take out in the summer off the recommendation of a friend. The Kismaayo Chicken Suqaar was alright. Maybe it was a case of ordering the wrong thing but my life was not changed after eating the food. My meal had raisins in the rice which was I thought was cool and added a different element. Other than that the food was in the middle flavor wise.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"I was really disappointed when I left the restaurant, especially after reading all the stellar reviews. My boyfriend and I went during a time where there was not a lot of foot traffic outside, a snowstorm had just passed. We figured it would be quiet and intimate, we did not factor in how cold it would be in the actual restaurant. They basically had ONE portable heater to heat up the front of the restaurant. On top of that we were practically the only people there until another table arrived and it took us an hour to recieve our main course. Overall, the service was nice, they gave us free tea because it was our first time eating there but unfortunately I would never go back. I appreciate the hospitality but this place is too cold, very slow and the food wasn't the best.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"Everything about this place is special! The taste of the food, friendliness of staff, ambience... And yes, food! They were kind enough to play music from our phones and we ended up dancing (!!!) and drinking. They offer BYOB. What more could you ask of a place! Overall perfect. A night to remember. There were 15 of us on late Friday night (around 11) and the service was perfect. We tried lamp, spicy chicken, mango chicken, beef, samosa appetizer and all tasted very delicious. My favorite was lamp and samosa. The owners are from Somalia themselves and the food was authentic. Nothing like I'd tried before!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"We love the favors of the food here: full of adventurous species but not over powering. The appetizers are all tasty with the aioli and the yogurt sauce bring big flavors. We also love the homemade flat bread that has a perfect crispy texture. There is enough in the menu, including mango curry and sambusas, to accommodate our two vegan friends too.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,Amazing food.  I highly recommend the mango curry chicken or the goat for an entree. The beef sambusa was extremely tasteful.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,My fiancé and I have had dinner here few times and one of those times we invited a friend who also thought just like us that this place is one of the African restaurants in NYC. We had dinner here again on last Friday of 2016. It is the only place that made sense for us to end our 2016 foodie experience with a bang. This is the only Somali restaurant in NYC and fortunately for us it is located in Harlem. Their food and service are impeccable! I didn't think their service could get any better but they proved me wrong because our waitress last night was excellent. She anticipated our every need before we even asked and she was always checking on us to make sure we are enjoying our time. They don't serve alcohol so come with your drink if you're the type that can't eat without wine. We always come here with our wine and they are always more than happy to give us glasses and wine opener. We plan on definitely coming here again and will invite more friends to join us.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"I have no idea why this has 5 stars.

1. Allowed patrons to hold tables of 4 and 6 tops of upwards of 30 minutes for their parties instead of allowing patrons waiting to have a seat.
2. Did not say welcome or seat us anywhere. Good luck figuring it out on your own.
3. Service really slow and don't expect to see a server without obnoxiously waving them down. The place is yay big...
4. If you're a pescatarian don't depend on enjoying the chefs special fish. Tons of bones, spicy but flavorless rice and yet the menu recommends pasta with the dish. I requested the pasta and it tasted like hot tap water with a solace of milk on top. W-T-F?!
5. Did I mention the staff was topsy turvy?
6. After seeing I didn't eat any of my meal sans the teeny tiny boney fish, I was charged in full and given a ""special Somali tea"" to make it right. Unmm.... YELP already told me you give the complimentary tea to all guests.
7. Ok..... The server was very sweet and apologized but......
8. Off to find flavorful food now.
9. And scene.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,Truly dissapointing.  Hiked uptown to this restaurant based on review in New Yorker.  Appetizers were ok but did not finish the fish of the day entree.  Service was welcoming but could not overcome the mediocre food.  No air conditioning and it was uncomfortably hot inside.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"Ok, so my first few bites of the goat stew with lots of nicely cooked peppers and onions were fine, but the addition of a dash of salt and a squeeze of the lime provided elevated it to brilliant! Rich flavor with just a touch of spice and very tender meat. Accompanying rice was tasty too, as was the complementary aromatic tea with ginger, clove, cardamon and bay leaf.
Server was very friendly.
Will def be back to try some more of their Somali food--apparently the only Somali restaurant in the region.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"Where do I start, this is by far the worst Somali food I've ever had. One star is  an understatement, unfortunately 0 stars is not an option.

We had the  Hilib Ari which was not seasoned with your typical Somali spices, it tasted as if they added Soy Sauce and they added raisins to the meat which is very unusual.  The rice was hard and over cooked.

We also had the chicken suqaar with Chapati, the chicken was salty and very oily and flavorless. The Chapati was the frozen Paratha that you can buy from your local Indian/Pakistan Grocery. The Frozen Chapati was not fully cooked. The food was highly over priced we spent $50.00 on three meals and we left with our plates hardily touched.

I wouldn't even call this Somali Food not sure what it is,  I'm surprised there are Somali reviewers on here who are  raving about the place. Makes me wonder if they are affiliated with the owners.

I hope the owners find an actual Somali Chef, I would hate for people to actually think  that this is authentic Somali food, this is a very poor representation of Somali Cuisine . Huge disappointment.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"Based off of the Yelp reviews, I came here on a Tuesday with a friend and we weren't disappointed! The place is simple and small as others have mentioned, but it detracts from neither the food nor the dining experience.  Our server was very nice and gave us some recommendations. We ordered the mango chicken and the goat. Both were incredible. We were offered complimentary tea, and it too was delicious. To be fair, neither of us are familiar with Somalian cuisine, so we don't know if what we had was authentic, but we will most definitely come back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

Safari Restaurant NYC,The food is amazing and so tasty. There is not much to say about this place...it's real food and it will make your mouth enjoying flavors that you never tried before. The restaurant is minimalist with nothing fancy but if you close your eyes you will travel far away. Don't go to this place if you want to have a date...it will not work.

I've had their fish and the vegan wraps and their tea and everything I've eaten there has amazed my palette and left me smiling and feeling full.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"This is my favorite Somali restaurant ever. Delicious food, great atmosphere, friendly feeling, and fantastic owners. I like everything from samosa to chicken suqar. A must try restaurant in the city. If you don't have plans for dinner either on the weekend or the weekdays. Get out of your home and head to this spot. It will never disappoint. Every time I eat there I always leave happy and more than satisfied with the quality of the food they offer. The tea is also really good and soothing. I'm just glad I have a go to Somali restaurant in the city to enjoy eating at. I have been to Minnesota and Kentucky Somali restaurants, but Safari is by far hands down better than all of them. Thanks for always the great food!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"Never had Somalian cuisine so I was very eager to check it out. Thankfully this place did not disappoint, the owner was super sweet and patient. Not being aware of the menu, I had to repeatedly ask her for advice on what to get and how a dish was. She was informative and not rude which I kindly appreciated. I went with my best friend and he got the mango curry while I got the famous goat dish as our entrees. I absolutely LOVED the rice that accompanied our dishes, very flavorful and resembled heavily of south Asian biryani. I loved the onions and gravy that surrounded our dishes as well, and the flavor of the actual meat was incredible. My best friend seemed to like the mango curry but I normally do not like sweetness in my savory meals. As for me, I really enjoyed the goat but I still tasted a bit of the rustic-ness of the meat. Maybe I am being biased because I don't really appreciate the smell of goat, but I decided to give it a go here. I enjoyed it nonetheless, and loved how sweet the chef was as well.

I highly recommend the samboosa I believe as an appetizer, which is very similar to south Asian ""samosa."" I thought it was very good along with the sauce that came with it. Overall, the restaurant serves very flavorful dishes that brings personality into Harlem.. Something that seems to be lacking more and more nowadays. I wish this restaurant the best of luck, I truly want this restaurant to stay in Harlem and make its mark. I hope to go back one day again and order the steak.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

Safari Restaurant NYC,"I've eaten here about 6 times now and it's become my favorite restaurant. I mostly order the hilib ari, which is a goat dish. It's absolutely delicious. I've also had the lamb special, chicken and beef dishes there and all are fantastic. Somalian food is more about flavour and seasoning than sauces, so the food is never too heavy. Don't forget to try the chai tea with your meal, because it compliments the seasonings well.This is my go to place to take company, because the food is excellent and the customer service is brilliant. I highly recommend it and I'm a pretty fussy eater. Please note that this is not the type of nyc restaurant where you eat as quick as possible and leave. It's a place to enjoy company.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

Safari Restaurant NYC,"Delicious! Every dish is packed with flavors. I actually started this review before some of the widespread media attention Safari recently recieved, but when I was there I enjoyed what seems all to often be an underated cuisine. Delicious blends of Indian Ocean spices, flavors. Hope that's still the case when I next come.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"The food is amazing!  Saw all the yelp reviews and had to go, so glad I did!  The food was excellent!  We had the beef sambuzas (beef patties) to start off.  They were excellent, similar to a ground beef empanada but not too deep fried outside and the cilantro based sauce to dip was tasty.

For the mains we had the goat which hands down is the best dish!  I had the mango curry chicken, again excellent and extremely tasty.  I haven't had anything with that flavor before it was good and wasn't sweet like how at times mango based dishes can be. We also had the steak with pasta.  I am not sure what was in that pasta but it was excellent and probably the best pasta I've had in New York definitely did not expect that at a Somali restaurant.  I would actually consider ordering the pasta on its own as a dish there.  

The grapefruit based juice was extremely good and refreshing.  The hibiscus berry juice was also good but it is a sweet drink.

It is a small space and very cozy.  The host/server is extremely hospitable.  Service can be a little slow for beverages and attention but the food comes out quick and given it is one guy managing all the tables it is understandable.     As an FYI there is no liquor or beer.  They accept cash & credit cards just no AMEX.  Will definitely come back the yelp reviews on spot on the food is great!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

The food was very good, had the goat which is slowly cooked for 6 hours. Very tender. Good flavors. Served with rice. Spices influence of India and Italy. A green sauce made with lime, cilantro and other spices. Its spicy but delicious, fresh at the beginning then spicy. The tea at the end closes the deal!  Try it!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Safari Restaurant NYC,"Fantastic restaurant with great food and amazing hosts.  Our group of four tried their Sambuzas (beef and chicken patties), Hilib Ari (roasted goat), Mango Curry Chicken (grilled chicken with mango curry sauce), Chicken Suqqar (spicy chicken stew).  The entrees came with spiced basmati rice and chapati, a flaky/buttery flatbread.  We finished our meal with their crepe and chapati desserts.  

The goat was a standout and if you come as a group get multiple orders (we ordered two for our table of four).  I like spicy food so the Chicken Suqqar was also memorable for me.  That being said, everything we had delicious, distinct, and perfectly cooked.

The people running the restaurant were also incredibly hospitable and generous.  A plate of goat got bumped onto my shirt/lap during the meal by one of my companions.  The hosts not only quickly and graciously moved us to another table and cleaned up our mess, but without a word, they also brought out a complementary replacement entree for us (even though I managed to salvage most of the dish)!

I ordered the Kismaayo Chicken Suqaar, Homemade Mango Juice, and also had tea after the meal. The chicken was perfectly spiced and was coupled fantastically with the basmati rice with a few raisins on top which created an exciting and delicious complex of savory and spicy flavors with a touch of sweetness. The chapatti was soft and went very well with the chicken. The side of bisbaas sauce is the icing on the cake. I was eating the bisbaas sauce with just my fork- that's how good it is! The mango juice was a perfect drink to have with this spicy dish and it tasted fresh. The tea at the end of our meal was phenomenal...it came already sweetened and tasted like it was spiced with ginger, cardamom, and cinnamon. I'm not a big tea drinker, but I will be going back frequently, even if just for a cup of tea! With the old school Somali funk/jazz music playing in the background, I felt as though I was having the ultimate authentic Somali experience.

Appetizers arrived, not the ones promised, which had run out, at 10:30.  The goat dish was delicious and they were gracious enough to offer a free banana crepe desert for the delay and overcooked steak.  You can also bring your own wine.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"My fiancé and I were there two weeks ago. We went on a whim because I had never been to Harlem and WOW, was the food amazing! The two Monas (I hope I am spelling this right) were extremely hospitable as soon as we entered. The wait time was very little, and the ingredients were fresh. I ordered the chicken and my fiancé had the popular goat dish. The flavors were so unique and the bizbaz sauce and rice were two of the best things I have ever eaten- no joke. The rice was fluffy and flavorful, and the sauce tasted so good that we basically drank it! The addition of banana to the meal was a great way to add some sweetness and balance out some of the spicier or saltier flavors. We enjoyed the homey atmosphere and great music playing in the background as well. Also, don't miss out on the tea- it totally soothes and relaxes you after a filling meal. We will definitely be coming again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

You can truly taste Somalia's history as a trade port, with influences from the Middle East, India, Africa and Italy. Somehow it all blends together wonderfully. I'll definitely be back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants

Safari Restaurant NYC,"Really, really good food, decent prices, and good service. The chicken stew and the beef wrap were both excellent, the chapati was fresh, and the sauce was amazing. We ordered the dessert (a honey and chapati creation) which was the perfect small end to the meal. They included complimentary tea, which was also great. We'd never had Somali food before, but the combinations of spices and overall effect was what you'd expect from a northeastern African/ Indian ocean cuisine.

Safari Restaurant NYC,"When BCD had a 2-hour wait, I went across the street to find the other buzzing place in town before the pandemic hit. Although I was craving kimchijiggae, the self-serve, by the pound hot bar had me exploring more Korean food. I tried to get a little bit of everything I could to make for missed banchan, like fried chicken, kimchi fried rice, fish cakes, beans, and pajeon. I also found Milikis here (something I found at a local Korean restaurant in Ann Arbor) and was really happy to wash it down with a drink I enjoyed with my budaejiggae. The best find of the evening was the pre-packed boxes which I took home for the next day's meals since fried rice and japchae save pretty well. Waiting for the day when it returns, and I can scramble to find a seat again.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/safari-restaurant-nyc-new-york?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I lived in NYC for 1.5 years before moving to Boston. When I went back to Manhattan recently to finally move out of my apartment at the end of my lease period, I really looked forward to getting some Woorijip seafood pancakes to go. Unfortunately they were closed due to COVID and it literally broke my heart. Woorijip, you are such an institution in the NYC food scene that if you started a social media fundraising campaign, I'm sure your fans will happily pitch in. Please re-open soon; we are all rooting for you.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Woorijip (our house) was/is my go to when I want to have quick Korean basics that will satisfy my need without really too much wow factor. It's truly the best Korean fast casual if you want options. I was truly disappointed when I found them shuttered due to this 2020 disaster that is March Sadness and April agony.

The last time I had Woorijip it was early March 2020. The virus was slowly infiltrating the city and Woorijip was ready, forcing their customers to hand sanitize and put on those plastic gloves your umma wears to make kimchee before even going to their many prepared foods for sampling. Once I scrounged up some goods including spam and egg kimbob (truly comfort food kings) I was given several free items just because (this was almost closing time too so maybe that's why?).

Regardless I'm sad my house is closed but I will continue to support it when it's available to me again. Best place on this block for a Korean smorgasbord. No it's not the most amazing Korean food but it settles a craving for me.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"- Stopped by to grab some food
- Hot food bar
- They have lunch boxes that you can purchase with a soup/salad/kimchi/rice for free
- On weekday evenings they will put some leftover items on a separate tray at a discounted price
- Great for pregaming with soju if you want to go out in the area later
- Quick, affordable, spacious",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"We dropped in around 1pm on a busy weekday but the crowds weren't bad as the line was kept moving. We went through the buffet and got two boxes. The boxes are $9.99 per pound but you can get a surprising amount of food for less than that. You also get 5% off if you pay with cash.

The buffet is separated into cold and hot foods and there are a LOT of options. They have a lot of food that I haven't seen at other Korean places so it was great to try new things. My favorites were the rolled egg, the crabmeat pancake, and the rice cake. The bulgogi, clear noodles,and mushroom fried rice were also delicious. Definitely planning to go back and try the prepared foods as well.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Woorijip,"Ktown is defined by Woorijip. An unassuming place among many korean stars in Ktown, Woorijip never fails to hit the spot.

Walking in, there are so many food options to choose from that it might feel overwhelming. Whenever I'm at Woorijip, I can't help to notice that there also always so many people there at all times. I think the reason why people always rush here is that the food is 1.) awesomely good 2.) the price is something so reasonable and unseen in today's age.

You obviously can't go wrong with any korean classic, but for me personally I really like the japanese fried chicken and stir fried beef. Something about eating from Woorijip reminds me of Korea and you can be sure to find even more discounts before the close!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Amazing grab-and-go place if you're having a busy day. I needed to rush for a train at Penn station and decided to stop just 2 blocks away over here for a bento. Was quite overwhelmed with the amount of options I had, but settled with this fried chicken cutlet box, which also comes with a free side of kimchi or miso soup for your choosing.

Didn't get to eat this until an hour later when I got off the train, but even when cold, the food was amazing. The chicken cutlet was very thick for the price and very savory, especially with the kimchi. It also came with a piece of tamagoyaki and some slices of radishes to cleanse the palette.

Highly recommend for grabbing something quick for work or if you're arriving from or leaving for Penn station.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I met a friend for lunch near his job in Midtown and he chose this hidden gem. Especially when you are meeting for a lunch break, there are a few crucial elements: 1) speed (people gotta get back to work) 2) convenience (to eat in or leave with ease) 3) quality (it is a dining experience so the food shouldn't suck.) 4) cost (we are not trying to spend so much to make us work another hour).

Woorijip provides quality Korean cuisine (day that 3 times faster) efficiently and inexpensively.

The unassuming environs actually can feel a bit chaotic when you first walk in the door, but get a lay of the land and you'll find a beautifully choreographed dance. The buffet is in the front is the more costly but customizable option purchased by weight. But keep walking to where the true treasure lies.

Stacks of freshly packaged, clearly labeled containers of food with which you can just grab and go. Sushi, Japanese fried chicken, protein and rice combos, noodles, vegetables.... all just at your finger tips like the takeout menu just came alive.

I picked up the rice noodles and a bulgogi (korean style stir fried beef) containers. About $5 each and either could easily be a light meal. My friend got the Japanese fried chicken ($7.50).

After you make the selection the real fun begins. About 5 registers which all seem to be competing with who can turn transactions quicker. They consumed a line of 10-15 people in under 4 minutes. They use flags to notify the next person in the queue. They take debit but offered a discount for cash.

We sat (during the lunch rush we had to scout out a spot first) and then I ate an exquisite combination of korean beef and noodles. It was some of the best I had. We ate, enjoyed lunch and kept it moving.

What more can you ask for to get a quick bite?",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I've been coming to Woorijip for a few years and it never fails to hit the spot when I'm craving Korean food. I like how it's a self-service location where you grab whatever you want and pay at the counter. They also have numerous tables and chairs in the front and back but they do fill up fast especially during lunch time.

Some of my favorites are the kimbap, ddukbokki, and garlic chicken. They also have a buffet where you fill your container with food. It costs around $10/lb.

Give this place a try!! It's seriously one of the greatest spots of K-town.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Even though I always come to NYC as a tourist, I've been to Woorijip multiple times to just grab some good food with friends. It's reasonably priced, fast, and tasty. The only downside is that every time I've come, it's been super crowded. Be prepared to hang around on the side in order to snag yourself a table as someone is leaving. Also another plus, the bathrooms are pretty clean!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Minimum purchase on credit card is $10 less than that you have pay by cash. They said really really good Korean food and my favorite is their Buffet. They charge you $10 a pound, and you have a variety of Korean foods to choose. Not all of them are delicious to my level. Lol. Their japchae is good but not great because I am able to make some good japchae. If you are on a budget and you want to eat good and cheap Korean street food, this is the place. I'm not talking about oxtail bone soup or any delicacies when it takes a lot of time to make.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Oh my goodness, what a gem. My boyfriend and I were walking through Koreatown after a movie and were hoping the food court would be open for a quick snack. Unfortunately, but fortunately our movie got out late and it was closed. Although we initially planned to continue our walk to the subway, we, by the grace of god, stumbled upon Woorijip. At first, we thought it was closing as we couldn't see any food nor was there a menu outside, but we took a risk and walked in anyways. Big risk, big reward. We were met by a treasure trove of prepared Korean meals. Even better, since we walked in so late, some of the food was 50% off. Ddokboki for $4, kimbab for $1.75 (50% off), kimchi chiggae for $4, you name it, they most likely have it!

Also, it seems as if they have a hot food bar going throughout the day. In addition to the amazing food, there is a fridge full of kimchi and banchan (side dishes) you can purchase to take home. Also, there were a plethora of Korean drinks and snacks alongside flavored sojus and Korean beers. I'm telling you, this is the jackpot. There are plenty of tables to enjoy your meal at and it seems as if it's a popular spot to grab a bottle of soju with friends and enjoy a drink with a meal!

Highly recommend this spot as it offers Korean food at a very affordable price! And, it's open till late! 2 am! Closed on Sundays!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

I was so craving kimbap. I got it. My favorite too. Spicy Tuna Kimbap.

So many options. Seriously. I wish I had enough stomach to eat everything. I wish I drove to NYC instead of taking the airplane so I could take all this food home with me.

There is a hot bar too. I got some food there too. See, I cannot make up my mind.

Food is cheap. Lots of variety. Delicious.

I also got the gingseng chicken soup, along with other stuff. I just want to eat everything.

Plus they are open late. Like really?

They always have the same dishes out, and I'm a fan of the Kongnamul Muchim (Korean soybean sprouts side dish).  Their soups are $4 and they have an assortment of to-go items already packed if you don't want to do the buffet.  They do sell alcohol here, but the Soju bottles must be finished on premises.

The buffet is around $9.99 a pound. You get a discount for paying with cash. I highly recommend the chive pancakes in the cold buffet and the kimchi fried rice. The broccoli rabe was also really good. You don't have to get food from the buffet bar. There's also packed food, soups, and Korean drinks.

Woorijip,"I've become a huge fan of Korean food in the past year! When I heard about this place, I was excited to try it! What more can you want than a buffet with all kinds of Korean foods?
I stopped by with a few friends around 5:30pm on a Friday and they were busy. Most of the tables were taken. If you plan on eating inside, you'll just have to wait for a table to open up and grab it as fast as you can.
They serve Lunch from 11:30am-3:30pm and Dinner from 5pm-10pm. Their pricing is $9.99/lb. They offer a Small plate option and Large plate option. I went with the Small Plate and loaded it up as much as I could! My total came out to about $10 or 1lb of food. Pretty solid!
They had all kinds of dishes from crabmeat pancakes to kimchi fried rice to braised spicy chicken to bulgogi to inari sushi to fried fish to so much more!
Everything looked decently fresh  and tasty. You're not allowed to sample anything but if anything stands out, you might as well put a little bit of it to give it a try.
Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with Woorijip! It really hit the spot. There is so much delicious food in KTown but do yourself a favor and try Woorijip if you haven't yet!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"It's hard not to like Woorijip. How many nights have I stumbled into this place with the drunchies to satisfy my hunger with delicious and cheap Korean food? Over the years, it's been too many times to count. I've enjoyed countless lunches from the hot buffet, which has a variety of banchans and heartier rice and noodle dishes alike to choose from.

Though the buffet is awesome, the non-buffet food area is where it's at. Kimbap rolls galore for just 4 bucks a pop, soondubu, japchae, donburi bowls, all for surprisingly low prices. You serve everything yourself and pay at the register, and there's plenty of seating. It's a wonderful no frills, cheap place to get a lot of delicious food.

Pro tip. They serve alcohol here! You can buy sake, beer, makgeolli, and soju. With it's bright lighting and bare bones seating, it might not be the ambience most people are looking for when they're having a night on the town, but when you're trying to save $$$, this will do.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

After stuffing my face with pizzas and Shake Shacks while I was in town, our last stop before heading to the airport was much better on the waistline and wallet.  Not to mention it was every bit as good as the other enjoyable tastes of NYC.

There were a constant but fast moving line of people at the buffet but we elected to explore the prepared meals which were great.  We ended up having a massive braised beef rice dish which came with a boiled egg, duk, and some pickled vegetables, all of it tasty.  We also had fried fish in egg which was so light and delicious and bulgogi kimbap.  A totally filling meal for two people for roughly $20 and heathy I might add.  Thanks Yelp!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"There is so much selection in this place from cold food package, hot food package, to like a buffet like where you can pick what you want. I got the food from the buffet where they charged $9.99 per pound. It was honesty pretty expensive for this charge because I paid $20.14 for this. However, I felt like it was worth it because the food was REALLY good and pretty filling too. The variety of Korean food makes the place stands out and that's why the line is usually really long. They would give salads as a option for side dishes that went along with the hot package food. If the price was a little bit cheaper for the buffet like then it would be much better. Overall all the other parts were pretty affordable.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Great for a quick, casual meal. Self-serve, cafeteria style food is well-prepared but nothing extraordinary. Some dishes were too salty, and the hot bar ($9.99/lb) was just a little more than warm. However, there is a good variety of options at the self-serve bar (seafood, braised beef, fish cake, salad, etc.) and I cleaned my plate. If this were near my workplace, I'd come for lunch multiple times a week but wouldn't visit on a fancier night out.

You must spend at least $10 to use card. Food in each image was about $10.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

I agree that the restaurant itself is setup kind of like a cafeteria but who cares.  The food is awesome and they have everything I wanted.  It's so easy and quick to pick up things to go to bring to work or home.  

The prices are very reasonable and the food quality is awesome.  There are always so many options to choose from that if I lived in the area, I'd be here constantly to try all the different Korean food options.  The one time I was able to go, I picked up the beef kimbab and I love that they don't skimp on the filling and it's not mostly rice.  

I would definitely come here again.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Their egg with veggie squares are absolutely filling and nutritious and tasty.

Spicy crab- what peppers are those! Damn good and spicy. But the crab meat was something I never had before.

Spicy Korean chicken- okayish but not having that again.

Seaweed salad is pretty standard and nice.

Shrimp shumai is pretty good. Nice shell packed with filling but don't really get the shrimp.

Crabmeat pancakes are probably my most favorite thing here. Have got these a bunch of times.

Service is great. You can also choose from wine, sake, or beer. There's a 5% discount if you pay cash.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

And you've come down off your acid trip
Now you need late night munchies
To get you through til lunchies
Well come snack on Korean at Woorijip!!!

I like to Woorijip Barbie, mainly, and other girls similarly perfect, and maybe whoever she tells me to since she's so mean (swoon). I don't really Woorijip Woorijip though, but it's good, and I love that it's open mega late.

It was a really cool and bizarre experience. Basically a self-service Korean Buffet with all kinds of items, grocery store style, some of which are fresh and hot, some of which were cold - and basically all kinds of crap going on in here.

Best yet they're open up until 3 in the f***ing morning like who saw that coming? A lot of the things on this street are open really late, so Koreatown is a wonderful place to hang out late late late night in Manhattan and everyone kinda does.

So I got myself a little bit of tofu soup and it was pretty good although not amazing. However what it was, was dirt cheap, I mean absolutely dirt cheap like you get full on this thing for $3 and I'm like whoa dude bring it on.

And what else in Manhattan is this cheap, especially right around here in Midtown. Pretty amazing in terms of prices.

And then some of the customers were hitting on me and telling me I was beautiful and asking me out - and anytime that happens in a place then I like the place even more obviously.

They pretty much Woorijipped me honestly.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"The go-to stop for some quick, cheap Korean food. They have a variety of things to choose from including drinks. I often come here for lunch and on some of the dishes I see an offer for soup, salad, and kimchi for an additional $1. I'm not sure if this promotion runs the whole day.

What I like about this place is actually the management. The staff here always seem to be on top of it. It is always clean and well-stocked and if the line for checkout gets long, someone immediately jumps on.

Of course the quality of the food is also great for the price! While it is mostly Korean food, I have spotted some things such as tempura and katsu.

They also accept debit cards (not credit) with no minimum which is great as many people no longer carry physical cash on them.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

I wasn't the biggest fan of the kimchi fried rice nor the crab pancakes. I wish they had restocked the fried chicken too, but they hadn't in the time I was there. The rice cakes were quite good and veggies as well. Would love to try their premade meals next time!

For starters, there's a whole line of more traditional Korean dishes which are offered in a buffet style (charged by weight) for those who want to try things that probably aren't as mainstream as what you'd find everywhere else. These are definitely great for those who want a unique taste of authentic Korea without having to travel there.

Further in, there are also shelves of freshly made and pre-packaged foods that are probably more widely known in Western cultures, such as different flavored kimbap, kimchee jiggae, seafood jiggae, kimchee fried rice, etc. They also have a variety of soft drinks.

Because there are so many shelves and lines of food, seating is a little more limited. Busy hours can be BUSY. But the great thing about all the prepackaged foods is that you can always just pick up a bunch of things to go.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

There is a pay by the pound which I didn't bother since I've heard it's not of great value compared to the packaged kimbaps and other packaged goods. I went with the beef kimbap and a complimentary side of soup. For around $8 for 12 pieces, it's a very good deal for food that is pretty decent. It's not the best food I have tried, but it is still a bit better than grocery store packaged items. I personally would check this place out before checking out food at Hmart since I feel this place does it a bit better.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I've been to Woorijip multiple of times but never got the chance to write a review.

Woorijip is a wonderful place in K-Town that sells drinks and food, and is affordable. It is convenient for a quick grab and go food or you can dine in. There are lots of seating at the front and back of the restaurant, but can quickly be filled up.

One thing that I liked was the Spicy Squid Roll w/ Wild Rice ($3.50). It tasted sweet and wasn't that spicy for those who can't handle spicy food. I highly recommend this!

I would suggest to check this place out if you're in the area and want to grab something quick to eat.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,This place is always a great place to go if you're around Korea town and need a quiche bite or are super hungry or it's late night. The food is tasty and spicy which is something I love. There's a lot of variety and its self service so it's pretty quick.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Awesome spot! My friend requested we find a late night eats spot and he said it looks good and affordable so I agreed on going.
The place was packed with post partiers, academias, and under 30s. The food is all located on a shelf where you pick whatever you like. There was bulgogi, honey garlic chicken, various sushi rolls, noodles, seafood fried rice, porridge, rice bowls, octopus, literally everything! I wanted everything we ended choosing a few different things and pick at all of them. You can't find this type of Korean food anywhere.

Tips: If you dig around you can find some half off platters. Cold items tend to be cheaper if you want to take home and heat up.

Just nitpicking it's pretty crowded so finding a seat is tough. Also caught a splinter from the chocksticks, that's never good.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I was attending F.I.T and my classmate and I were craving a bite. So he had recommended we eat here. I can't recall exactly what I had but it delicious and filling. It's a very cozy ambiance, and home and tons of selections of Korean cuisine. Inexpensive and worth every second.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Best to go korean food! This place is relatively cheap for the amount of food you're getting. I love their korean pancakes, lunch boxes that come with either 1 soup/water/kimchi/side salad. Always busy at lunch time. The japanese fried chicken and soba noodles are also really good choices",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"If you want to try many different Korean food without spending a lot this is the place. There is a buffet which is charged a reasonable amount per pound. I went in and tried almost everything in buffet, in small quantities. They also have packaged food for take out, which are also reasonably priced. Whatever I liked in buffet, I took home too.

Beef patties were my absolute favorite. It is soft beef covered with batter. Among the pancakes, mung bean pancake was the best. Kimchi fried rice was spicy. Vegetable fried rice was good too. Chicken in curry is a very good item to take home. It is crispy fried chicken (like katsu) in a flavorful curry. Garlic chicken and spicy chicken were fried chicken. And was good. The bulgogi take out box has rice and glass noodles as well. Quantity is nice. Plus there is a free soup with it. With the sauce they provided, it tasted very nice. Glass noodles or clear noodles by itself taste very good. Simmered potato tastes good as well. Edamame salad was very nice and crunchy. Definitely try it. Spicy bean sprout was good too. Braised beef shank with egg was ok. Streamed egg custard did not have much taste.  Rolled egg with laver didn't have much taste either.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Woorijip,"Woorijip is definitely a place that is great if you like to choose what to do. The buffer style food is measure by pounds, each pound costs around 8-9 dollars I  is great because there is such a variety of dishes of food that I can choose from, ever time I come back, I tend to try new things because there are so many things that I could try here. They do offer bento boxes as well, the bento boxes is great for people wanting to buy something to eat and is at a rush. A favorite items of mine that is offer is their kimchi fried rice and their fried chicken. Both are soooo good. Strongly recommend you to try them if you ever want to try out this place.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"If you're looking for the cheapest meal in KTown, this is it! Woorijip is one of the few places in KTown that has all of its food ready made. Everything is in a takeout container, or you can put the hot food from the buffer in a takeout container.

Everything is super cheap, and the food is actually pretty decent! It has a cafeteria vibe, but that's what the place is going for. It's full of drunk high school and college students on Friday and Saturday nightspot since it's cheap!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Woorijip,"This place offers great cheap Korean/Japanese food that keeps bringing me back. Taste-wise it's of course not as good as what you would get in a restaurant, but considering that the majority of their lunch boxes costs less than $10 for a sizable amount, it's hard to beat. Their menu changes day by day and I have never been disappointed with any of the food.
Would definitely come back many times in the future.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Came here very often for lunch. The food is Korean style. Spicy and fried but natural food. More healthy and can adjust the body system after digestion. The kimchi fried rice with fried egg has been a spicy rice and tasty experience. The fried pork with pineapple, makes the food naturally sweet. Natural sweet pork is more healthy and tasty. Would come back for more meal time.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Woorijip,"I've been coming here for years and cannot recall a single time I've been disappointed at their food. This is hands-down my favorite authentic korean place in nyc for a quick no-fuss lunch/dinner on-the-go or some takeout.

It's not the most glamorous experience: you line up, grab a container, and spoon into your container anything that strikes your fancy before lining up to weigh your food and pay. However, the food is authentic, consistent, flavorful, and most importantly, fresh. Though the food is made in large quantities, they do not compromise taste, texture or quality and fresh batches come out very regularly. Their name, woorijip () which means our home in Korean, is apt since everything tastes like it's made at home and with love.

I cannot say enough good things about woorijip. It is affordable; it is delicious; and it is quick. Woorijip truly redefines what fast food looks like. To top it all off, if you bring some cash, you'll get a 5% discount. Trust me and come here. You will not be disappointed.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"This is the best place ever! I loved coming here as a college student who hardly cooked and wanted affordable korean food. Also, they had a loyalty card program once (not sure if they still do) and I was able to get my first black stone pot for free. I still use it to this day to cook spicy tofu soup - 10+ years later :)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Convenient and quick, Woorijip offers decent lunch food. You can choose to pick a box and filled it with various food items or pre-package lunch boxes. I think the pre-packed ones are cheaper. The other option allows you to pay by the total weight of the food that you got.
Overall, a decent spot for a quick and easy meal.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Came here for lunch while waiting for my document to be accepted and shipped. When I entered, there are cooked and cold foods.

It was busy when I entered as it was lunch. Ordered from the buffet that costs $9.99/lb and radish soup. The prices here are cheaper than going to a restaurant as it is fast casual. Got a little bit of everything, which costs $14.

I would recommend anyone on a budget to come here.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Woorijip is great for a quick meal of pretty good quality Korean food at reasonable prices.  There is hot food at the steam table and hot and cold food that is packaged to go.  The food is often replenished during the busiest hours and there is so much variety to chose from.  I love that they offer hot soups and stews, as well as egg custard and three types of rice.  May of the items on the steam table are also available packaged in larger quantities.

Tables are available to eat in.  I've been here a few times and find that turnover is pretty quick as most people don't linger at the tables.  

I have found Woorijip to be clean and the staff to be friendly.   There may be a line to pay but the line moves quickly.  I think this place is a great option if you don't want to go to a full service restaurant or just want to try a lit bit of everything typically found at a Korean restaurant.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Came here on Christmas day for a late brunch/early lunch and they were just starting to put out their Korean ban Chan and packed lunches. Although this place opens quite early they don't actually have the self serve buffet-style option open until 11 am which ended up being fine since my family and I just got a bunch of the pre-packed dishes and shared it all.

It got my parents' Korean stamp of approval so ya know it's gotta be authentic. They got all the classic dishes that Korean grow up eating like all the soups (from kimchi soup to bean sprout soup), traditional packed lunches like variations of ggimbap, and a bunch of other things like bulgogi w/japchae, fried cutlet, steam egg soup (gaeranjjim) etc. and of course lots of traditional ban Chan like kimchi, myul-chi, ggakdoogi, etc.

I got to see the buffet before I left although I didn't get to try it and I was admittedly a little regretful that I didn't wait to try it since it opens at 11 - everything looked so good! How it works is you grab a container and any combination of the food they have in the warming trays (of which they had an endless variety from bossam, Korean fish, pa-jeon, amongst countless others) - and your charged by the pound of food, with rates differing depending on whether you're there for lunch if or dinner.

I think altogether what makes me the happiest about this place is how absolutely reasonable the prices are for Manhattan koreatown. You can eat a hearty, genuinely delicious meal for under $10 which is a rare find nowadays. Also, did I forget to mention they have alcohol? And it's super cheap? As in $4 a beer cheap. As in $4 all the time, not only during happy hour, granted I think they stop serving alcohol at 3 am.

Anyways I was blown away by this find in koreatown, I guess there's a reason it's so well reviewed! Delicious authentic Korean fare at ultra-reasonable prices. Also the ladies there who were working on Christmas Day were so nice. Not playin, you gotta come here - especially if your tryna grab a short, cheap yet delicious meal on the run or with limited time in general. Also, I can't speak to how busy it gets during peak hours but there did seem to be a lot of seating as well.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"As a longtime Woorijip buffet evangelist I want to take a moment to appreciate the other offerings during non-buffet hours, which are pre-made but don't taste that way. Tonight I had a large curry with rice, a small kimchi and a Nestea can for $9.17 including tax. Woorijip is unbeatable if you factor in taste, value, speed and PATH proximity.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"The biggest strength of this place is affordability. You can get a solid meal for 6 dollars from the prepared food section. The hot food bar can get pricier, so I recommend not getting in that line unless you want to try a little bit of everything. Any type of breaded chicken will have lots of bread and not much chicken. Not the best Korean food, but overall eating at this place is a value deal.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Stumbled onto this place when I was craving tteokbokki, but they didn't have any that was freshly made. So I picked up some kimchi fried rice and tofu instead.

Overall they sell decent Korean food at a fair price. I think it's a good place if you're in a hurry or if you just want a quick meal fix. They sell box foods at a fair price.

I also like that their containers are microwave safe. Makes it easy to keep at reuse!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Really love the concept of Buffet by weight! I wish we have this in the Bay area California. The stuff from the buffet was awesome. I got different kind of Korean pancake, kimchi pancake, green onion and leek pancake, the crap pancake which my son left the Saba fish grilled, and chapjae which is the glass noodle, steam egg and rolled egg all for $5!! They opened until 2 am too WOW, right in the middle of decorian strip on 32nd avenue beside Gongcha. The only thing I don't really like these the purple spicy squid kimbap it was too sweet for my taste. Great concept and I love the fact they have pre-made bento boxes that you can just grab & go besides the buffet choices and they also sell small snacks with instant noodles  My kind of mix pot and list of favorite food!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Very cheap, yet great tasting food. I love all the options they have and they have a very nice seating area. It can get crowded during weekdays at around four or fiveish, but if you get there earlier you can get nice seats. It's a nice place where you can study or just grab something quick to eat. Always a good place to go to when in need for a heavy snack. I go here a lot of the time when my friend and I have no idea what to eat for dinner. My favorites are the vegetable dumplings and the shrimp tempura!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"This is definitely one of my top go to places for whenever I'm in the city, I don't know what I want to eat, and I don't want to break the bank. They have pre-packaged foods that you can take home and a hot and cold bar full of classic Korean dishes that you can purchase by weight (similar in concept to Whole Foods).

I personally enjoy the latter option cos I can get a variety and choose how much food I want based on how hungry I'm feeling. My personal favorite from the hot bar is the grilled saba which I would recommend to everyone!

This place is pretty poppin' at night on the weekends as well cos a lot of people will pre-game with their Soju before heading over to the clubs.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

You can't really go wrong with the food. On the weekends, it's a good place to get soju, but recently they put a cap to how many bottles you can buy at a time and they stop serving after 12am (I think?).

Seating is very limited but people also come and go very quickly. The food is solid and good bang for the buck. I took a chance on the shrimp and bacon okonomiyaki and I was pleasantly surprised. No dancing bonito flakes but the flavor was good! Very worth $7,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"My friend and I got rolled eggs ($3.75) and spicy pork kimbap ($7.50) and both were alright. The rolled eggs were a bit bland and the pork in kimbap was kinda tasteless. The rice was also a bit hard. It's not terrible, but I don't think I'll get these again next time I visit and instead I want to try their cafeteria style food bar!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

If you want to eat Korean food but don't want to sit down and order, this is the place to go. You can either eat in Woorijip, or you can grab food to go.
We came here at about 11 pm, and it wasn't too busy. Later at night, there are groups of people eating, drinking soju and talking loudly, but this didn't make any difference to me!

Prices are very reasonable too so if you're on a budget and have a craving for Korean food, I would highly recommend here.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Let me throw another positive review at Woorijip and see if it sticks! Extremely popular fast casual spot to get your hit of Korean comfort food. Nestled in the heart of KTown, this place is never not busy. My PT used to be around the corner and Woorijip was my biweekly dinner.

You're feasting with your eyes first, as the selection is maddening. Their kimbap always pleases, as does their multitude of entrees that include every meat, seafood, and vegetable under the sun (or hot heat lamp). Pork belly, spicy sesame chicken, eel, chili squid, tofu salad, japchae, multigrain rice, kimchi. Don't forget your spicy bean sprout soup, which comes with every entree. I once forgot it and the cashier and I both shared a moment of disbelief.

I always want to give other kimbap places in KTown a try (E-Mo, I'm looking at you), but end up right back at Woorijip. One time I found myself at Food Gallery 32 across the street and quickly exited to come right back here. My feet knows what my heart wants and carries me straight there.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"This mini food court style Korean restaurant is great for affordable foods. They serve lunch and dinner in a buffet style where they charge by the pound. They also have prepackaged boxes of different foods ranging from kimbap to fried chicken to porridge and rice meals. Of course since it's prepackaged, the quality isn't as fresh and the chicken is soggier than I'd like but it's all at affordable prices! There's also a good variety of drinks to choose from and lots of seats inside, although it typically gets busy and crowded so it can get difficult to find a table.

Woorijip,"Woorijip is no-frills Korean deli by day and THE prime K-town pregame spot by night. What's not to love?

My prior visit to Woorijip consisted of (too) many bottles of soju so I'm glad to have had a less than blurry experience when I dropped by for a light dinner. Up in front, you'll be enticed with an array of hot and cold dishes that are, in fact, not served buffet-style, as other reviews have stated. It's actually a pay-per-pound type of dealio but at 8.99/lb and with the wide variety, you can get a little bit of everything for a decently priced meal. However, if you are on a mission for just gimbap or any other delicacy, head on back for the prepackaged meals. Apparently, these are slightly cheaper based on the ""wholesale"" concept. The more you buy of a certain thing, the cheaper it gets. Make sense.

The great thing about this place is that it caters to the big, small, picky and non-picky Korean food lovers. It's not the most delicious Korean food in the area but if I'm trying to fill up (or drink up hehe) on a budget, I'm walking straight to Woorijip.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Still a definite YES for me!

Went with the brother for a late night dinner on Saturday. We got two takeout options: the sweet and sour pork noodles ($7.50), fried chicken ($6.50) and Korean Kim chi fried rice ($6.00). Total Bill turned out to be $20 on the spot. SO CHEAP!

PROS:
Korean fried chicken was so crispy and juicy! Very well seasoned indeed and the scallions on top add a great texture and freshness to the chicken. The highlights were still the kim chi fried rice and sweet and sour pork noodles. Not only were they dirt cheap, but also their portions were huge!! Definitely good for a dinner or lunch on anyday. Noodles' sauce was incredible aromatic, flavorful, and had a right balance between sweet and sourness. Kim chi fried rice each bite had a distinct kim chi flavor to it making the dish overall incredibly unique.

OVERALL:
Very impressed with the quality, price, and service at Woorijip. I know I will be a regular here :D",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Whenever I'm in Korea town and want to grab a quick bite, I usually frequent Woorijip for a cheap snack or order their takeout entrees. Its quick to order, ample seating and affordable meals. I also like how they give you a complimentary small bottle of Poland spring water if you purchase one of the meal set entree. I'm a fan of the seafood pancakes, fishballs, rolled eggs, sushi and garlic chicken, eel, salmon over rice. Though I don't think their salmon or meat are as fresh as other venues; the meat and seafood entrees are laid out and not contained inside a fridge or heating station. Therefore, there are bacteria in the meat and seafood. I stopped getting the meal set entrees. Occasionally I used to get chicken and beef over rice that are placed inside a heated shelves.

I am surprised the health department hasn't inspected their food and give them a rating.

They open late during the weekdays and had the (stamp) reward program. Unfortunately they told customers their rewards program ended in December 2018 (e.g., 10 stamps and you get a free snack like a trio of seaweed). Hence 3.5 stars as oppose to 4 stars.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Stopped by here for lunch today. The store has an extensive selection of Korean food, all of which is packaged for customers to grab and go. There's noodles, rice, kimbap, soup, and numerous side dishes such as kimchi, seaweed salad, and tofu. They regularly add something new to their selection. There's even a buffet area where you can select your own food for $9.99 a pound.

There's so much to choose from! This time, I got kimbap with squid and purple rice, two soups for a dollar each, and a lunch box with rice, smoked eel, and seaweed salad. I stopped during lunch hour, when the store is at its busiest. But the cashiers are extremely efficient and the line moves very fast so there's no extensive wait time.

I got some kimbap, tteokbokki, japchae (ultimate favorite), braised lotus root, braised potatoes (I mistaken it for Korean pickled radishes) and some kimchi fried rice, around $13. The best tasting ones were the japchae and kimbap, which doesn't say much since those 2 are really hard to mess up. The kimchi fried rice was pretty bad like I couldn't taste anything, no kimchi or rice taste whatsoever. Maybe I came at a bad time or I should try their prepackaged stuff instead.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

You have the option of building your own entree from their food bar for 9.99/lb or picking one of their prepackaged boxes. Options range from kimchi fried rice to japchae  as well as all types of banchan.

We were surprised to find a variety of Precooked to go Korean food at an affordable price!!! Especially compared to the Food Gallery nearby.

We got the Kimchi fried rice ($8), Pork cheese kimbap ($7), Garlic sweet chicken ($5.50) and Spicy squid ($3). All were delicious and easy to eat on the bus!

Woorijip,Love this place!!!! So many healthy and light food options! I especially like this pumpkin puree porridge!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Actual rating would be 4.5 stars, if that were possible. Is this the best Korean food I've ever had? Nope. However, where Woorijip wins for me is in value. I will readily admit that I am a huge cheapskate and, as such, do not eat out much when I am alone (cheap salads from Trader Joe's for me, please!) Woorijip is nice because it offers a large variety of Korean dishes for takeaway. There is also a reasonably large dining area so you can sit down and eat after you've paid. Great place for a casual group dinner, or a solo meal.

The hot food line has a wide offering of dishes that you can sample. At $8.99/pound, it is easy to accidentally overload your container and end up with a hefty price tag. To avoid this, grab one of the prepackaged meals for about $8.50 each. For an extra $1, you can add a soup or drink. Or you can grab some prepackaged porridge ($3.50) and then sample some of the sides from the hot food line.

I only give out 5 stars to places I would visit regularly. With so many food options in NYC, it's easy to never eat at the same place twice. But I will definitely return to Woorijip.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,Why don't we have anything like this in VA or MD? The variety and selection they have in the small space is amazing. I took a few kimbaps and an entree back on the bus with me back to MD. I pretty much stank up the bus (sorry everyone but I tried to eat as fast I could!) and was a very happy girl.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"So. Many. Options!! Packed into one space. It's a long store with seating in front and back. Buffet options or lunchboxes aplenty. Whether you're craving rice, noodles, kimbap, vegetarian, chicken, curry, soup, none of above or all of the above.. they have it. Open literally all the time, except on Sundays. I enjoy the food (and prices) at Woorijip. 5 stars!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"This place has both a buffet where you pay per ounce and a selection of boxed meals. Was hesitant to try the buffet (the food looked amazing and I have a problem with portion control) so I opted for a boxed meal instead.

Bought a chicken cutlet and pan-fried kimchi, which sits atop a bed of white rice and comes with a Korean omelette thing. Popped it into the microwave (so smart and convenient that Woorijip provides this) for just a minute and ended up with a DELICIOUS meal. I could only finish half, so I got two meals for $8. What a steal.

Also tried my mom's baked mackerel platter  and, wow. I can only describe that mackerel as buttery, almost decadent. Loved that it came with fish tofu. Only $7 for this box.

I was also surprised to find very ample seating and a relaxed ambiance. This is unusual for NY's cheaper restaurants. Will be sure to come back every time I'm in town.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"There are many varieties of Korean ready-made lunch boxes. And I went with the buffet by lbs. was a big mistake! I felt sick and I knew it wasn't clean there. The reason is , they have no space to place the tongs , so is laying on top of the food, and people's hand grab it and place it back on the food.
I bet they will not passed inspection for that buffet. The tongs are also slimy and  sticky.

Go with hot food all well packed in the back area.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Very nice place with a selection of food, drinks and side dishes. There's food for anything, even a buffet kind of style. The workers here are always restocking and the place is always busy when I come in. The cashiers and baggers are very efficient and now with the white flags they use to signal when they are ready for another customers is so adorable. The food is always delicious and tastes up to date. Will always come back here",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"A fast casual Korean eat in the K quarters of Manhattan. What's unique is that it's almost like its own food court, with heaps of prepackaged (but apparently freshly cooked) and pay-by-the-pound items for takeaway or eating in.

I opted for a pack of bulgogi roll and panfried tofu, and picked out a cabbage salad for a free $1 item that comes with the roll. No complaints about the food here, although there's nothing like truly freshly fried tofu. One wish is that there was no drinking water for customers eating in.

Would I call this authentic? I've certainly had more authentic K food, but this place has its appeals and I'd go back.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Two days i was craving for kimbap so I went online and do some yelp searching.

I found woorijip authentic Korean food which it got me interested.
This is not a fancy restaurant! So don't expect this place to be fancy.
Inside there's variety of Korean drink section along with alcohol beverages and American drinks as well.

During lunch hours there's a line where you have to pay for your food.
Inside it set like a buffet style.
I had my breakfast this morning and lunch just now.
I got my lunch for $10.72 with a drink that I brought.
It's cheap!! It's not expensive!

There are food from cold to hot.
Their kimchi made me happy today.
I love kimchi especially when it's freshly made.

For lunch I got the pancake, kimchi eggplant, marinated beef, tofu skin with rice (I think)
Everything was good but it was salty as well.

In small container such as kimbap, kimchi, porridge, soup it's very cheap! Kimbap I saw were like only $3.50 but they are small little tinny rolls.

All the workers seems nice, the lady recognized me and said hello. I think she's around her 40s. Very nice lady.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

I feel that some of the hot buffet have too much sodium, because I can taste the strong soy sauce taste.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Woorijip is a must!! I love love love Woorijip! There is a variety of things to choose from and the options always fulfill my cravings! The lines can get long but the cashiers always make it an effort to get through them fast. There are quite a lot of seats but they can fill up pretty fast!

There is also the option of getting hot foods in which you select specific items and they charge you by the weight. If you walk further down, there are pre packaged foods that you can easily just take for a pre set price. As you start lining up, to your side you will see a variety of different drinks, including alcoholic beverages! As you go towards the front of the line there are also different kinds of chips and sweets as well! Woorijip has it all.

Woorijip is not at all expensive and the quality is always great! The consistency of the food remains the same, amazzzing.

Woorijip,"The food here is always so fricken good. However, the buffet can get pricey af. It is $9.99 per pound and you get to fill up your plate with as much food as you want and you are charged by how much your plate weighs. The meat/poultry, noodles and spicy rice cakes weigh the heaviest so if you're on a budget, get less of those. My half-filled plate of food totaled to $14. Yikes. They also have a whole selection of Korean food already pre-made for you that you can grab and go if you cannot stay for the buffet. In my opinion, I think the pre-made to-go containers are more worth it and filling. You can also get those to stay, and there is no waiter service so no tip is needed and the place gets REALLY packed during ANY time of the day. But the food is bomb, so I will be back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Usually you go to buffet for value rather than quality. Here it's the opposite. $9/lb is the same as Whole Foods, not cheap. However, most items taste so good that I couldn't believe they were from a hot food bar. I'd make this my daily lunch AND dinner spot if I live anywhere close.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Came here for a quick take out lunch with a coworker! Being it was a rainy weekday, the restaurant wasn't too packed so we were able to get our food within minutes.

I was starving as I didn't eat breakfast so I opted to go for their lunch buffet. Pictured here starting from top left and going right to bottom are: Braised Lotus Root, Rolled Egg, Mung Bean Pancake, Stir-Fried Broccoli & Brussel Sprouts, Kimchi, Braised Pork Bones, Kimchi Fried Rice, Crab Meat Pancake, and Kimbap.

I absolutely loved everything I got (minus the Mung Bean Pancake as that was a bit oily for me)! The Braised Lotus Root and Pork Bones were braised perfectly with the right amount of seasoning and the texture of both were so on point! The Rolled Egg was so soft and contained the perfect amount of ingredients. The Stir-Fried Broccoli & Brussel Sprouts was also great in terms of seasonings and texture as I loved how crunchy they were. But my absolute favorites were the Crab Meat Pancake, Kimbap, Kimchi, and Kimchi Fried Rice! Everything about those dishes was on point and I would definitely get those again when I come back. I also got their Sweet Potato as a side dish and oh my god, it was so good! Just the right amount of sweetness and it was also so soft! It was a great way to end the meal for sure.

My friend got their Spicy Pork Kimbap and Braised Pork Bone Soup and loved them as well! The flavors really came through and the soup was nicely seasoned. Would definitely recommend ordering this if you're ever in Woorijip.

Overall, this is a great place to grab something cheap and quick if you're in a rush! I'll definitely be coming back sometime in the near future.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

This place is basically a cleaner and cheaper version of Gallery 32 across the street, with a wide variety pre-packaged meals and a buffet, charged per weight. There's a lot of tables available, but this place can get very crowded during peak times so seating can't be guaranteed. They also seem to change around the menu sometimes so I've been a little disappointed before that I couldn't get some of my favorite meals, but there's always a ton of other great alternatives to choose from so I never feel like I wasted a visit. Service is also very friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Food is ok and there are many options. It is convenient to quickly pick something up during lunchtime. It does get busy during peak lunchtime, but the line does move rather quickly. My rating reflects my experience at the register.

First, I was annoyed with their card machine that ""doesn't work well"" according to one of the employees there. My first credit card didn't go through and I was asked if I had another card. After the second card's transaction had gone through, I got a text, alerting me of my first credit card's transaction (Thank God for text alerts). I showed the employee the text and pulled up my bank app showing my first card's transaction had indeed gone through and that they had just charged me twice, once each with my two different credit cards. I had to wait for another employee to come over to cancel the second transaction.

Second, employees don't seem to really check what they are ringing up. Knowing that they have a $10 limit on credit cards, I made sure to grab more than one of the pre-packaged food, one $6 and the other $4.50. The food was packaged in the same small container. But it seemed to me that the employees were much more focused on quickly ringing up customers that they do not really check each container for the price. When I looked over the receipt later, before throwing it out, I noticed that I was overcharged. My receipt showed both items to be $6! The difference is only $1.50 but how often is this happening?

When you do come here during the peak lunch hour, do check your receipt before leaving the store. Also, if they claim that your card didn't go through, check your bank transaction to make sure that you weren't charged multiple times.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Everything is overcooked, dry, and questionable. The beef kimbap was awful. The meat was like cardboard. The self serve hot foods. Dear lord you call that tteokbokki? Friday evening when I thought the food would be good and fresh due to turnover. What was everyone else eating?!

$10 card minimum.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"If you haven't been to this gem in Ktown, you have been missing out big time! If you want variety from soup to rice to noodles to Kimbaps that are rather cheap/reasonably priced and you can just pick up to go or eat in, this place is for you.

I love the $3 seaweed soup with clam meat. There must be like 15 clam meat inside the pint with abundance of seaweed which makes it so flavorful and is my comfort food especially during the wintertime. The $7 broiled eel bowl is perfect in size. It comes with a $1 salad, soup or water. Instead of getting the $1 soup, I just pay extra $2 for my seaweed soup.

Don't forget to get the point card. You get a stamp for every $5 spent. When you collect all 19 stamps, you can redeem an item that are on display behind the cashiers.

This place is a food paradise! There's buffet style costing $8.99/lb for those who want an assortment of Korean food items. There's also prepackaged hot foods, including dumplings, kimbap, steamed pumpkin, shrimp tempura rolls, bulgogi with wild rice etc. for those on the run. The lines are always long during lunch hours, but they move fairly quickly and there are enough cash registers and cashiers to accomplish that.

Woorijip,"One of the only places I could find Jajangmyeon (black bean noodles) and tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork) in the city after returning from Korea. I love Woorijip because of their wide variety of authentic feel-good Korean food.

Woorijip is half buffet half prepackaged food, so you can either build your own or grab one of their pre-made lunch sets. Either way, both your wallet and belly will be left full. The buffet food is charged by the pound ,but makee sure you come at a time that it's actually open! The buffet hours are from 11:30 am to 3:30 and then its closed for prep until 5:00 pm.

Woorijip is a nice lunch spot by day and a pregaming heaven by night. If you're looking for a quiet late dinner you might want to skip Woorijip. On the other hand, if you're looking for quick bites, lots of Soju, and fellow drunken K-Town exploreers then Woorijip is the place to be.

At first I did not get the concept, but all you have to do is walk towards the back and grab whatever packaged meal you want and bring it to the register.  While some of the food was good, it was nothing special or gave us the wow factor.

Definitely a cool joint to check out if you need something quick and do not have time to wait and in the mood for Korean food.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"My regular trips to K-town invite a new dining experience based on my mood.

In this case - healthy, sit down but casual enough to permit my grungy outfit.

This place came up with a high star rating on Yelp and was on the same block.

I was relieved to find that it was -
1. An almost industrial cafeteria style
2. Mostly Asian patrons
3. A hot buffet for $8 a pound
4. Prepackaged meals to go from soups to
   Meal combos, to rice bowls to desserts.

I hit the buffet for some hot food.  I scored a half baked mackerel, some Ferris wheel shaped lotus roots, glorious Kim chi, sauted eggplant, Kim chi fried rice !!, and more.
The food was fresh and tasty and cost me around $9 with a seltzer.

After eating I had to survey the wonderful foods - jealous of what I missed out on.
I grabbed a rice cake for dessert $1.50, and a Kim chi soup with pork to go $3.  

Walking down the street I had to stop and try the soup.  It was that perfect rainy day love, with some good pieces of pork and Kim chi.

I love Koreatown.  As a matter of fact I havnt had one bad experience there.   I think I might have to try all the restaurants.

Summary
This packed cafeteria style eatery has fresh healthy Korean food at a good price.  At 2pm I had to wait for a seat after I got my food.  It's popular for a reason.

Woorijip,"I was introduced to Woorijip by my Korean brethren(s) in 2005 (before I even heard of Yelp) as a late night spot to just grab some casual food. I like it then for that aspect, a simple casual dining place. Has it changed much? Nope. Woorijip has managed to stay almost exactly the same and that is great. I never came here much for the hot buffet because it just seemed not so enticing to my palettes. But I enjoy all their packaged foods like gimbaps, noodles, vegetables and deserts.

This was the place I ate my first blood sausage. Ah, the nostalgia.

It seems the hot buffet has remained the same/changed very lightly. I also see that the packaged foods as expanded lightly. I didn't notice the complimentary water on my recent visit or did I miss it. I saw the microwave.

There is such a variety of prepackaged and by-weight foods. The by weight foods are limited by the time of day that you come but there's a mix of proteins and veggies and carbs there.

The prepackaged stuff is my favorite because it's like two meals in one container. There's so many items to choose from it's crazy. My favorites are the spicy pork, chicken curry over curry, and the tofu soup. They also have sushi, pork, noodles, soup, and more. In the fridge section they have little bonchon packages that you can buy separately and a lot of variety of drinks including soju. In the back and in the front there is seating so you can eat or social.

This place also offers full-dishes in a takeaway-grocery style setting, hot and cold dishes labeled for takeaway and stored appropriately. This is not a sit-and-order place, but more cafeteria-like in that you pick out what you want from the buffet and/or ready-made packaged food, drinks and snacks, and check out, and either take it with you, or sit at one of the many tables to enjoy your fare.

Plenty of options, including several items I recognized and some I didn't, but that's what made it great - I didn't have to order something I wasn't sure I would love, I got to pick and choose in small amounts, so that next time, I might be able to go right for the packaged food.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

No fuss, no thrills... not fancy, just Korean quick eats... and me & my friends used to looooove eating here: cheap, good food and soju.... but that all changed pretty quickly.  Don't get me wrong, Woorijip was a consistent hangout place... for the last 15 years.  After Reno, new layout, came with new price$$!

My favs included kimbaps, cold sprout salad, beef bulgogi, jeons, japchae and seasonal fishes.  Their package lunch boxes were also decent.  

Now in 2017... a little wiser... should know better.  Couldn't help myself - went in for a quick bite.  Their food turned to sh*t quality, prices went 20% higher and I don't see how anyone would pay $12-13 for a crappy lunch box!?!

I went a little before 5pm so they were just preparing their buffet. I peeked at their options though and they left me near drooling. As for their boxed foods, there were various kimbap rolls, bento boxes, and hot foods like katsu curry.

I got the katsu and curry rice - all hot dishes and very YUMMY! Reasonably priced too. My friend got a bento box that included the purple-ish red sticky rice, which I don't see often in Korean restaurants. I tried a bite and it was really good!

The quality of the food is so bad. Beef bulgogi was hard to chew, and it tasted bland. Kimchi tasted too salty. As for the kimchi pancakes, they were plain awful. They didn't taste like kimchi at all, and they were way too oily. I thought I was chewing on to a soggy cardboard box.  Fried rice was okay.

I heard people usually come here to get cheap soju before clubbing. I don't recommend you to get food here, but definitely do come if you are looking for cheap drinks. I went on a weekend night, so the majority of people were drinking instead of eating.

Would definitely return to try more items.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"This place is a must for people trying to get a quick bite or wanting to try korea food. They have a buffet style serving yourself a plate or getting the packed meals like tofu soup, kimbap, chicken, rice, bulgogi, rice cakes, side dishes, kimchi and so on. All the plates are affordable price and pretty big. If you pay with card the do charge you extra but you probably won't spend over ten dollar per person.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I don't know why this place has so many great reviews. It was average in my opinion and low key expensive, depending on what you get. It's essentially hot buffet food that you weigh and pay for. It would be fine if it was SUPER cheap, but that really wasn't the case. I remember piling on a normal amount of food & having to pay around $15 for it. If I was going to pay that much, I'd go to an actual restaurant where the food doesn't taste like it came out of a buffet thing! The flavors weren't super great/authentic even and the quality wasn't great either. Maybe I eat too much & piled on too much food???? Idk for $15, I didn't feel like it was worth it. Would much rather go to an actual restauarant w/ good quality ingredients & more flavor! This place tasted too ""fast foody"" for my liking. Guess if you're looking for something quick, it'll suffice. Also, the soju is cheap.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

And a beer with some friends.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"1st time here & didn't know it was a buffet till I saw the food. Most of the meat is sweet (chicken & beef, not a fan of sweetmeat, keep the sugar for dessert). The chicken teriyaki was really good & although it was sweet, I wanted seconds. Some of the Fried tofu was sweet too.

I didn't like the crabmeat Patty, it was too bland. The Jeon & the gyeranmari was good: I wanted seconds. The shrimp fried rice was good. I really liked the kimchi, esp the zucchini or cucumber 1 ( cant remember which 1). Their cabbage kimchi is the best I've ever had! It tastes really fresh & crispy & not fermented & no smell unlike most places. I only took 1 piece. If I had known it was so good, I would've taken a lot more.

The japchae was good. 1 of the Kimbaps was good, the other was a bit strange to me, I think it was burdock root that has a strange flavor.

The beef patty they had was amazing. The gravy with it was really good. It was so juicy& tender & cooked just right. I wish I'd taken 1 more. I love the egg souffle. The pumpkin was slightly sweet but it seemed mostly bland this time.

The mushroom fried rice was good. I didn't like the kimchi Pancake though.

For dessert, they have this small red bean bun which was really good. I wish I had taken 1 more. The inari was good too.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Tastes like home! When I want cheap, homemade korean food, I immediately think of Woorijip. They have a buffet style where you get what you want in a plastic container and pay up front.

Woorijip,"This place is so awesome. The prices amaze me. Everything looks good but I've never tried to buffet (not sure how much it costs) I always get the pre packaged stuff. Kimchi jiigae (stew) is legit $4.50, so spicy, flavorful, lots of kimchi. The japchae noodles are delicious $4.50. The chicken cutlet over rice w kimchi is huge and is only $7. It took my bf a good 20 min to eat this. It's kind of a food hall that's self serve w tables and chairs. It gets busy during rush hour and can be hard to find a seat. But when it's slower it's fine. I went around 5:30 pm on a Monday and it wasn't that busy, was able to get a chill table in the back and relax. No one rushes you and you can sit and enjoy your drink/food as long as you want. A fave detail is that they have alcohol (beer, wine & soju) at near deli prices

I docked one star bc they don't wipe down the tables fast enough after people leave.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Woorijip,"New York is expensive - but this place is not. Tucked in K-Town (which is oddly close to Penn Station), this place has a buffet table where you can pick up whatever you want, or take your choice of pre-made dishes (warm and cold). You basically grab your plates, pay for it, and then eat! It's basically cafeteria style. The great thing about it is that it is affordable, and people are constantly coming and going. The food is great too - and seems authentic.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"This place has some great authentic Korean food! Lots of options so you can find something you are craving that day. It was my first time here and I opted for the hot and cold food bar which is calculated by weight. I was a little too heavy-handed and ended with $18 worth of food. This place can be cheap but it can also add up! Also, this place can get quite crowded and annoying at times so try coming during off hours to beat the rush.

I'm the type of person to get a little bit of everything so I can get a taste of everything and yes everything was good! I really liked their different types of pancakes (I think they had veggie, kimchi, and crab) and their bulgogi which was surprisingly flavorful.

Next time I will pick the few things that I like from the food bar and maybe buy one of their pre packaged gimbap.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Food is decent and prices are fair--hungry partner and I came here and stuffed ourselves silly at the food bar. We (more like he) even went back for seconds--he really enjoyed the hamburger steak and bulgogi. I, on the  other hand, really like all of their veggies (spinach, bok choy, and chinese veggies on point!), though I thought their japchae was just okay and their kimbap a little sad. I'm addicted to their pumpkin rice cake (""ddeok"") and it's just the right size as an individual dessert. Their porridge is also very comforting and well, most all of their things are actually very tasty. This is a great place to wander to when you just want small bites of everything or a snack.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"WOW. So cheap, efficient, and GOOD.
You walk in, grab a container, load up on the buffet of Korean dishes, then out in a few minutes. The line went around the place at noon, but I still zipped through in 5 minutes.

The food is flavorful and filling. Despite the buffet style setup, nothing tasted cheap.

I got:
- Kim bop
- Duk bok ki
- Korean fried chicken wings
- Sauteed eggplant
- Fried fish cakes
- Kimchi fried rice
- Rice with quinoa and mushrooms
- Fried mackerel
- Ja jang myun
- Assortment of pickles and banchan I can't name

AND a peach drink. FOR $11.82!!

It's such a good option when you want to try a bunch of different things - the variety is really astounding and it always takes me a while to look over all the offerings.  Besides the abundant pay-per-weight buffet, there are shelves of soups, bowls, veggie sides, and drinks.  You can easily get a filling meal for under $10.  I particularly have enjoyed making a meal out of side dishes, including their steamed kabocha (Japanese pumpkin) and miso soup. It tends to get crowded but there is a good amount of seating in the front and tables in the back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"9 years later since my Korean friend intro'd me to this place and I still stop by to grab take-out for home/picnics. Think: a small space with a variety of daily-cooked packaged Korean meals. They've gotten quite experimental with their dishes over the years and now, their entrees come with a side of kimchi, soup, salad or small water. If you get their frequent rewards card, you'll get a stamp for every $5 spent and you can cash those cards out for prizes (packaged noodles, thermos, water etc-- prizes are located on the wall behind the cashiers).

Woorijip,"A bit sick of the food spots by me at Penn Station so I decided to venture out for some yummy, authentic, and affordable Korean food! It was definitely worth the trip from my building at One Penn Plaza (about a 10-15 mins walk). OMG there were sooooooo many variety bento boxes and small snack boxes. You can also get buffet at $8.99lb. I got a Chicken Cutlet over Vegetable Curry for $6.50 but rice was sold separately so I decided to get a small snack of Scallion and Seafood Pancake for $5.00! Holy moly the line wrapped around the whole restaurant lol...pheww they had a cashier just for cash #score.

I took my food to go and sat in Greeley Square with my colleague but next time I am going to try to eat inside rather do take-out and take advantage of their AC lol

Hubba hubba *drools* the chicken cutlet was still crispy and not soggy from the delicious vegetable curry...you really don't need any rice to go with this dish because it's just superbly delicious mmmm

Wow the Scallion and Seafood Pancake was topped with mussels, squid, shrimp and etc but a bit overpowering from the scallions mmmm. Also I love the texture of the pancake. I am such a fan and will make many trips here soon for lunch =)",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Cute Korean cafe that serves Korean meals. This is located in Koreatown, and opens til 2 am!

GREAT:
- has a lot of seatings for big families/groups. It's big enough for you to have study sessions here while pigging out at the same time.
- the food is great! The meat and rice tasted fresh (even when we bought it around at 1:30 AM). The meat wasn't too chewy or too hard. The rice wasn't stale either.
- you get a free water bottle with a certain purchase!
- the food is big enough for two people imo. My group had bunch of left overs to take back to our hotel!

GOOD:
- I personally think some entrees were overpriced such as kimbab, that was priced at $5.
- the location was really hard to find lol. I expected it to be noticeable compared to other restaurants but the sign is kind of tiny, and it's in Korean, so for those who don't know how to read Korean... good luck haha!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I don't understand all the positive reviews of Woorijip.  If you're looking for some of the lowest quality Korean food paired with really low prices, then you're in luck.  But there should be extra emphasis on ""lowest quality Korean food"".

Sure, its really affordable. I'm not gonna lie and tell you that I don't stop in here from time to time. But honestly, its usually to pound shots of soju or chug a beer while waiting for Pocha to free up.  The hot bar is a sad display of hours old Korean staples, except every item has this miraculous quality of being extraordinarily soggy.  Literally every item.  Sure, for these prices, you're not expecting supreme freshness, but I found it to be inedible in all but the drunkest circumstances.  Luckily for k-town, the clientele generally is hammered beyond recollection.

Again, I feel like I'm being too hard on this place, but the food is really really poor.  Hats off to this place because its clearly very profitable, but the stews fall flat, the meat is poorly executed, and the starches are incredibly underwhelming.  

The liquor is cheap though.  Which is why it gets two stars.  So in that spirit, I hope this place stays open forever.  But I think it would be equally successful if it just sold reasonably priced soju/beer and offered a place to consume said soju/beer (which apparently is the most impossible of scenarios in k-town).  Seriously, soju is the jankiest, cheapest Korean liquor ever.  Why am I paying 17 dollars for it at restaurants?",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Wanted a simple late night snack but unfortunately their hot bar closes at 9:30 P.M. Anyway they still have other packaged goods, so I decided to try that but wasn't too happy with it. There's also a lot of drinks and some snacks, that I haven't seen anywhere else.

Soy Chicken Garlic ($8)- 3/5 I asked the cashier if this was 'fake' chicken and he literally seemed to have no idea what I was talking about and just said yes. Apparently it said 'soy' so I assumed it was fake, but it could have been soy sauce or something... but when I tasted it, it tasted and looked like real meat.. The gimbap was decent, nothing spectacular.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"This is a small cafeteria that is self-serve - grab what you want, pay, then find a seat to eat or carry it out. The food is amazing! I really like the spicy squid kimbap out of all the other things we grabbed. If we didn't eat only an hour before finding this place, I would've totally puffed out. Everything was also reasonably priced. We probably grabbed 4-5 of the pre-packaged stuff and paid under $20. What a deal!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Food is pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The key here is the convenience factor and the variety of food options. If you're a college/grad student who is on a budget, is craving home-made Korean food, and wants Korean food to take home to enjoy while watching your favorite K-drama, Woorijip is your best friend.

Prices are friendly. Most bento boxes run $6-8, banchans are $5 or so. My fav is the sweet and sour chicken and kimchi pork.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Woorijip,"Came here with some friends for some food before a Friday night out. Unfortunately we weren't able to try the hot bar items since it was so late but we were able to have some of the precooked items. Everything was pretty good, but I feel like everything would have tasted better if it hadn't been sitting under heat lamps for so long. Can't do anything about that though since we came so late.

I'd say this place is worth the visit due to the relatively low prices of food for solid quality and the convenience. This place becomes sort of a hot spot for the younger crowd before a night out. They sell soju at a cheaper price than some of the other establishments in the area, which is probably why it gets so packed. A great spot to pregame while chowing down on some korean eats!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

This place is more like a buffet but charged by pound. They also have a section where you can buy their dishes in a box for cheap prices. Great to carry to work as lunch.

You pay at the counter so no tips at all. You can go out to get a drink and come back to sit. It is very specious inside.

I'm hungry and I love Korean food.
I'm broke and I'm hungry.
I love Korean food, but why is it all expensive, hence woorijip.
Soju should not cost more than $9 a bottle in a restaurant (hurray Woorijip!)

They indeed are very authentic brought many of my korean friends who were visiting in NYC over the years and they say the dishes are like their moms home cooking almost! They all love this place as well!

I love how they don't use MSG ! A big pro in my
books so I don't have to worry about being super thirsty afterward.  My go to is either the buffet bar which is by weight or I like to get the Kim Bap (rice rolls with seaweed wrapped around)

The buffet bar starts with cold salad in the front, then moves on to the hot food! Staples such as fried rice, chap chea, dumplings, bulgogi, steamed eggs you will find there!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"So Woorijip is definitely not one of those fancy dining places. But the thing is... that is not what it is all about. Let's face it, this self-service place is here to make sure you are full and happy, and maybe even a little tipsy especially on weekends till 2 am (somehow I feel like we have been there later than that, but I might be wrong). As you approach the storefront, you see a glazed front and a black canopy above with a cute little cartoon house, with white Korean lettering below, and red English letters on the bottom stating ""Woorijip"". As you walk in, you are greeted by not so fancy interior with ACT ceiling, hardwood flooring & mismatched furniture, and also sprinkled with some uncomfortably tightly laid-out (or as I would prefer referring to them: extremely cozy) seats.

Immediately, you can see the cashier counters and a buffet with many delicious Korean dishes (there is always something great to pick from whether you are a carnivore or a vegetarian). I personally begin to salivate right there and then. Today, there were some: garlic chicken, scallion & zucchini pancakes, fish ball mix, soy pork, kimchi rice, Bussell sprouts & mushroom, some yummy-looking ribs, potatoes & okra, and many other mouthwatering items. As you proceed further to the back, you can see shelves stacked with some of the more delicious delicacies that one could get at the buffet, but also (additionally) many varieties of Korean styled sushi, bulgogi, bibimbap, japchae, kimchi, dumplings. As usual, I have no idea what to do with as everything looks delicious. Most of the dishes that one can get in this section are cold (not all of them as they are being added throughout the day), however if you arrive later in the evening you might need to make use of the microwave oven located in the area to heat up your food, (if you prefer it warm - I personally never had to do it, to be honest). Another section of food located on the opposite wall are perishable items that need to be stored in the fridge. I immediately pick up a container of spicy squid (it is not like I can ever not get it when I come by, it is a bomb). One can also choose from a variety of both Korean and Japanese soft drinks. However, one should be aware that on late nights and especially weekends, flavored Soju takes over. And let me tell you... it is good. There are some questionable flavors (no everybody agrees on which ones those are), but you should try them all yourself, just remember, you cannot take them to go.

I have decided to feast at the buffet today and try a little bit of everything plus the spicy squid and paid $14 total. I would not say it is the most economical option to go with (as the place is a decently inexpensive option to eat at), besides it is the city and the food is tasty as well as reasonably healthy (depending on what you choose - avoid fried stuff and salty items if those are your dietary issues). I have enjoyed both the meat (I had the ribs and garlic chicken - and I tend to be picky when it comes to meat), the veggies (I loaded up on the Brussel sprouts and mushrooms, potatoes and okra) and even some carbs (scallion & zucchini pancakes). Everything tasted fresh and I have filled up just right and didn't even get to the spicy squid, but I will have that later at home, as a delicious dessert ;).

To summarize, whether running our to lunch, running by on your way somewhere, trying to take a break from busy new york street life, hanging out with friends or going out to a casual food-exploration-oriented date, this place fits it all... and I love it! I sure think you might too.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"My favorite Korean Restaurant! Buffet forever!

Location: It is located in the heart of Koreatown! Prepare to fall in line during lunch and dinner! It could get really crowded eventhough there is a lot of seating! The buffet counter offers a lot of Korean staple food! There is also a take out corner where you can just grab and go!

Service: You will just meet the cashier which both speaks korean and english.

Food: OMG i love everything here! I've been to Korea and the food here is just the same! The buffet section is where I always get my food, the buffet has cold and hot food. It is per pound basis, so they have to weigh it and then you will pay the price. My personal favorite is the spicy pork, tteokbokki (spicy rice cake), kimbap (korean sushi), kimchi rice, sweet and sour fried pork, omelette, japchae(stir fry noodles) and bulgogi! For drinks try Milkis and Vilac Shikhye!

Price: Inexpensive

Feels like I am in Korea everytime I go here! So good and very affordable!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Woorijip is the best. Intrigued by all the positive Yelp reviews and the generally high price range of Ktown, I thought I'd give it a try.

Walking in, the restaurant is bigger than expected with lots of seating. There's a hot buffet bar on the right, and then rows and rows of hot and cold entrees, appetizers, soups / salads, drinks, and snacks near the back. I got a bulgolgi, purple rice, and glass noodle dish that came with a side of miso soup. With a Diet Coke, the total came out to be around $8 - super cheap! The miso soup tasted a little funky (too much salt and inconsistent flavoring), but the bulgolgi entree was fresh and warm. I would go so far to recommend picking the ready made dishes over the buffet bar when evaluating price point, convenience, and freshness.

Really enjoyed my meal, just wish I lived closer! It's right down the block from Hmart though, so maybe that's another excuse to come uptown more often.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

This spot is always my go-to whenever I'm in the area and have a craving for fast Korean food, don't want to break the bank, and/or need food after a night out. They have so many options, like the hot buffet (have never tried it before as I usually opt for the pre-packaged options), kimbap, fried rice, noodles, soup, just to name a few.

They also have beer, wine, and soju so the place is also a good option if you want to pre-game. My only gripe is the seating situation, which can be tricky. There isn't a whole lot of seating since the place isn't too big, but if you loiter long enough, you'll probably be able to grab a table.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Just a couple things and it's $10 already. They have prepacked boxes of food, 2 or 3 can be $15. I think the taste is fair. A lot of food is nothing crazy, fairly simple flavors. I come here late night sometimes if I want a variety in my dinner. Sometimes they put see boxes for 50% off and that a good deal. There was one time when they had some good things in there like fish cakes.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

I'll be back for sure.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I stumbled upon this fabulous authentic little Gem as I was walking to the bus. It's a buffet style hot and cold dishes that you pay for by the pound. It was designed and set up just like in Asia I Loved it.
Being a vegetarian there were several choices to choose from on the hot and the cold tables.
I also love mushrooms and several of their dishes contained all or lots of different kind of mushrooms which made it twice is good. Everything tasted fresh and incredibly yummy.
I got the cellophane noodles with vegetables, kale and mushroom,
an eggless omelette with vegetables,
an egg omelette with vegetables, Spicy mushrooms in a batter, which was just incredible. With a Coke and paying an extra $.50 surcharge for a specialty plate I wanted it came out to $10 and change which is the average price for buffet places in New York.
You always know when an Asian restaurant is good when 95% of the people eating there are Asian.
Everything about this place was authentic.
They have a large array of other dishes that you can buy independently and they have lots of Korean desserts as well as Korean sodas and drinks.
When you go to pay the girl puts your food on a tray with chopsticks I just loved it.
The mushrooms in a batter was a little spicy but they were so delicious I over looked how hot they really were.
They also sell different kinds of sauces so it seems they truly cater to the large Korean clientele that eats here and knows their food.
Everybody was very nice that worked there.
It was very clean as well.
There was a very large array of things to choose from including drinks, desserts, hot dishes, and cold dishes.
The decor is very simple but very nice.
it wasn't loud and the music was pleasant and not overbearing.
The customers were eating quietly and speaking quietly and I noticed no one talking on their phone. Heaven!
I look forward to coming back and trying something new.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Woorijip is a solid staple of Korea-town NYC. It's been around for a long time, offering delicious take-out Korean food at reasonable prices.

Their prices are the best part. Sure, since everything is cheaper, the quality suffers a little (but it's still really good!). However, the overall value of it is still an absolute steal. It's also one of the few places left in K-town that doesn't have an insane crazy wait (there's still a wait, but the line moves really fast).

I often find myself grabbing something here late night, whenever I'm in the area. There's a piece of my belly fat with Woorijip's name on it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Good ole reliable.

Woorijip is where you go if you're craving cheap Korean food or if you're looking for a late night soju spot with some friends. People don't go here because it's the best Korean food around. They go here because it's consistent; it has a wide variety of comfort food and a decent selection of flavored soju. It also serves as a late night meet up spot. Whether you're heading to club or coming from a nearby bar, you're bound to run into someone you know.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,The buffet was closed when I went but i was pleasantly surprised by their selection of box meals. The spicy bulgogi over rice and korean spciy chicken were both very solid and filling. The whole thing ran me $14.70,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,Came late at night and picked up some kimchi fried rice and dumplings. I was really shocked to see how fresh and flavorful the dishes were. They have so many options also. I will definitely be back to try some other dishes when I am in the area!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I'm no Korean food buff, but I do know that I enjoy this place when I want affordable, fast, and tasty Korean food.  I really dig the buffet style by the pound - who doesn't want options?!?  Not into buffets?  Don't fret my pet, they also have prepared meals.

Although they have a variety of food to choose from, this variety is quite constant.  You may see a new option here and there because of the season, but other than that...not really.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"So this place is good. A good quick bite to eat. You can't be too picky with it though. If I were at a sit down restaurant I'd probably have higher expectation.

Friendly staff, looks clean and nice options.
We had the kimchi fried rice with egg, soy garlic chicken,  crab meat Jeon, and the spicy squid roll with wild rice.
The soy garlic chicken was ok, not much flavor so I could have done without it.
Crab meat is also ok, not bad but not the best.
I love the squid roll with wild rice. Pretty tasty.
I also loved the kimchi fried rice, the egg on top was ok but the rice was sooo flavorful and filling.
This place has a nice idea of making it quick to get a good meal.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Come here for some cheap and affordable fast Korean food. I definitely recommend coming here for lunch or early dinner because if you go too late, most of the items are either gone or old. I came here around 945 pm and there was barely anything left. The food that we did manage to get wasn't bad. They have small lunch boxes and it also came with a free side of salad or soup. I really wish we could've tried some of their other items. Will definitely have to come back next time.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I've been visiting Woorijip for years and thought I should leave a nice 4 star review for this place. I work just a block away and get some fresh korean food from Woorijip often. Seafood soondubu, squid kimbap, bulgogi with rice, kimchi fried rice, fried chicken, chapchae, kimchi Katsu lunch box, rice porridge..... they're all warm and delicious. My recent discovery was Brussels sprouts with mushrooms. They're too good. Cashiers are friendly!

Only issue that I had was when my daughter was 1 year old (which is about 7 years ago) they told me to leave the store because I had stroller with me. I understand that there are not much space to get around with stroller and there are some hot food but they should put no stroller sign by the door so that we will make sure to not to bring stroller with us when we know we're going to Woorijip. Although food is great it's little disappointing that the place is not so kids friendly.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Wow, what an awesome place! I found it on yelp and we went directly there around 1 p.m. the place was full but no lines at the register, enough seating. We had spicy baby octopus and calamari with rice, crab pancakes, noodles and bean sprout soup. Everything was very good. My husband wanted to try the buffet but instead we went with the prepackaged plates, very warm, fresh. The place was full of Koreans, that has to mean something. We have to go again before leaving NYC.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I love the concept. Like many other Yelpers have noted... the interior is nothing fancy, literally just somewhere to eat and go anddd your food may be warm-cold depending on when you get there but you can microwave it if need be. That's for food that's left out anyway - you also have the option to try out their buffet (much smaller selection)

My food was delicious. They truly have a variety of things to choose from and at the price point, it's a great place to stock up on meals either for dinner during the week or lunch at work! I got kimchi fried rice with egg and Japanese fried chicken and both were delicious and only cost me $10 or so. I wanted to get more things to-go but I had a day of shopping planned and didn't want to carry a bunch of food around, so I'll be back. They also have some dessert options that looked really yummy but I had noooo room left to try anything that day.

Long story short, you're not sacrificing quality by going here because of the price point and with the amount of variety there's something for everyone.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"This is kinda like a cafeteria type vibe - serve yourself / take what you want and pay by the pound. I had an Inari (tofu skin) roll wrapped with rice, carrots and cabbage. Some kimchi, green beans/shiitake mushrooms, and buckwheat noodles. There are also hot food options, but I didn't have any although it looked great.

All this and a coconut water for $10 ain't so bad! Fast service and very fresh food (they change things out pretty regularly it seems).",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,Super great option when you want Korean food but are alone. Fast lunch option. Not cheap. Easily spend $25. Better to do the portions than the buffet but with the buffet you can try many dishes.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I've decided to come down a notch considering often times when I eat the spicy chicken here, I get indigestion. I suspect it's laid out to rest a little too long, and in the room temperature bacteria could spread.

Still, I like the vast majority of the things here. There are still some key things I dislike: namely, the garlic soy chicken. The Kimchi stew to go also isn't good. However, I have begun to enjoy more of the buffet choices. For instance, the meatball is pretty good, as is the bulgogi. I also quite like the kale pancake. The crab pancake and the kimchi fried rice is a little bit of a miss, but still not awful or anything.

I also think that there should be a slight revision to the status since it's no longer upon on Sundays, which is unfortunate since it's the day I'm most likely to come here.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Koreatown overall is fairly overpriced and it can be hard to find any affordable options with decent quality. Woorjip is the exception; Pay by the pound buffet with other pre-made to go options, it fills a nice niche in the area. The food is pretty decent, but not amazing. However, with few other places that provide a similar experience, it is worth a stop if you are in the area and crave Korean food (and don't want to spend a fortune).",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,Great deal for what you get. The spicy pork on white rice set was delicious! I'll try the kimchi and tofu soup at home.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Pretty good fix for Korean buffet pay by the pound. We got stuffed with one tray of some of our favorites like bulgogi,  shrimp, spicy squid, japchae, etc.  They have other options too besides buffet style. Was packed here , somewhat hard to find a table inside to eat, but we got lucky",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Woorijip,"Woorijip is a good place to eat if you are in the mood for Korean food and in a hurry. I expected this place not to be like a good restaurant to bring your friends and enjoy dinner together.

I got the combo plate with steak, onions, egg, and rice. It was room temperature. I wished the place had a microwave to heat up my plate. The dish was good though. The steak was well-done and chewy.

The service was good. I waited in line, paid for food, and sat at a table, and ate. What more can you expect? The place was clean.

Overall, if you are in a hurry for the train at Penn Station but do not want to eat McDonald's and want to be adventurous, try this place out.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"Fast, tasty, convenient. It gets a little hectic and it can be a little pricey, but it's great for a night to get some delicious Korean fast.

Woorijip,"Woorijib (as well as Food Gallery across the street) is one of the best self-serve dine-in and to-go Korean restaurants for students and tourists on a budget - up to $12 for a meal. Woorijib carries pre-packaged fresh meals in all variety of Korean food from spicy rice cake (dukkboki), bulgogi or chicken and rice combo, to appetizers such as korean pancakes and dumplings. There is also a buffet (pay-per-pound - price different depending on the time of day) for those who like to select specific items to eat. The lines are fairly quick and silverware is available by the door and in the back.

Woorijip,"We visited this location on 11/28 around ~5/5:30pm on a Thursday while taking an impromptu trip to NY. After a whole day of walking around in the cold, brisk city, we found on Yelp that Woorijip had great reviews and decided to check it out. Do you ever hate the feeling of walking into a store and not being greeted or acknowledged because of your appearance? Well,we were greeted instantaneously by 1 of the 3 cashiers and even offered help if we had any questions. (Bare in mind, we've been walking all over the city with 2 heavy backpacks and wind through our head!!) It was such a nice and warm welcome. We ended up getting a boxed meal (curry and chicken cutlet) and sampling the buffet bar (I got eggplants, kimchi pancakes, fish cake, mackerel, cake pancakes, kimchi rice just to name a few options) and we shared a miso soup. The buffet bar is 8.99 per lb. and the boxed meal for us was around 6.50. The spiciness and the warmth of the food hit the spot after being outside all day. The place reminded me of a more cozy version of the H-Mart food courts we have here in Maryland. I saw a couple of people sitting on their computer doing work while grabbing a quick bite to eat. Noise level isn't bad. Around 5:45, the lines got really long but went by quickly. Restrooms are clean.

Customer Service story: We decided to get some of their prepackaged bonchons(?) for our ride back. Our total came out to be 4.81 but checking our credit card the next day, they mistakenly charged us 14.81. We called back and within an hour, the problem was resolved and within a day the charge was taken off our statement. That's definitely more the reason for us to come visit again because 1) great selection of food 2) customer service is superb!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"In a rush or want to blaze through k-town culinary experience without spending hours either waiting at a restaurant or dining. Woorijip may be your answer! This no frills buffet style restaurant has a great variety of Korean cold and hot dishes at your fingertips. You may select a soup or stew to heat by utilizing the onsite microwave. Most items are priced by the lbs., however, there are items available a la carte. This a a great spot when you don't have much time to spare and desire some authentic k-town food.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Woorijip,"One of the good cheap Korean places in the city.  The service is pretty quick, as the pace of the New York minute.  But I don't know the staff are Korean, as they didn't say any Korean phrases involved in food manners.  Otherwise, their food is affordable, cheap and of great quality.  For example, the wild rice, bulgogi, seafood pajeon meal with your choice of bean sprout soup, water, kimchi or salad is delicious with a good deal with your money's worth, and it is filling.  For a good snack, consider some kimbap, or some banchan.  Even though that the kimbap is not as fresh as other kimbap places in Flushing, it is still good and cheap.  The sigeumchi (parboiled spinach in sesame oil) or some kongnamul (bean sprouts with sesame oil) is really good as a side dish to share with friends.  Maybe visit here more often if I'm in the area.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"For a cheap, casual eat, I would still prefer Food Gallery 32 over Woorijip.
The hot food is ~$9/pound, which means you're paying quite a bit for a small quantity of food. Their buffet selection is not that large, about 8 cold and 8 hot dishes. I will admit the buffet food quality is pretty good and the space is clean.
I've previously gotten a box of the squid kimbap, which was pretty cheap (~$5), but it was bland and cold.
Most of the positive reviews here relate to how Woorijip's packaged foods provide for a quick, easy-to-heat meal at home, which I could understand. However, for a cheap bite with friends, I would recommend Food Gallery 32.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I came here with friends on a Friday night, and it was as busy as expected. We all tried out the self-serve cafeteria and felt that the food was just okay. At $9.99/lb, it was pretty reasonably priced compared to other hot bar style restaurants in NYC. I'd probably go with one of the premade and prepackaged meals that's in the back next time, as they seem to give you much more food for a cheaper price.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"This place is my home in ktown. Always open with welcoming arms.

This place is great for the price of rest of ktown and has the cheapest soju in ktown. The place is fast paced and is always bolstering with people.

Woorijip,"I will forever love this place.

Found this spot years ago in high school and I will always come back for fast and cheap Korean food. Sometimes I bring my friends here and they're amazed by the price and the quality.

It's a great spot to grab something fast late night, for lunch or dinner. They're generally very fast at the register line and even created two separate lines. One for cash and one for credit card. During Friday and Saturday nights as well as lunch time, there's usually a long line. If you can't find seating, there's always the parks outside you can sit at and enjoy the busy streets of the city.

I usually get the prepacked food and usually get anything with bulgogi or the chapchae (spelling? It's the clear noodles). The portions are always large. Sometimes I get the rolls, which are also great.

Some meals come with a free soup, salad or water bottle. You have to check if it has the sticker on it.

You can also get food by the pounds if you really feel like eating a variety.

They have a large drink selection, including alcohol. Just got to remember that you can drink it inside, but not outside.

They have a rewards card system and with enough stamps you can get a free package of ramen or seaweed. I'm saving up for a pack of ramen :)

All in all, they're great and you should eat here if you feel hungry and you're a bit broke.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Woorijip,"I've been coming to this place for years! Never fails to disappoint me! I just wish there were more tables in the back because they can fill up during lunch and dinner time.

I don't go to the East side often, but I will get a takeout order every time I go. It is not the watery version you get from a ""Thai"" delivery. It is the authentic Malaysian style with a yummy thick sauce that clings around the chunky pieces of beef. Hot sauce over the half hard boiled egg with some pickles and crunchy cucumber. So good!

PS: their laksa is wonderful also",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/woorijip-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

LoveMama,"This for a review of tonight's delivery:

I was craving a banh mi sandwich tonight but other places had already closed up. Found this and prices actually seemed reasonable + all the great yelp reviews.

I ordered the highly recommended calamari and viet pork pate banh mi. Because it's delivery, totally came to around $27 including tip, service fee, etc.

I've had calamari delivered from other places before, and they've been warm and crispy. This was an absolute mushy mess. Flavors I think were there and definite kick to it but overall underwhelming due to soggy texture. Someone mentioned even at the restaurant they don't come out crispy anyway, which I'm okay with but this was just disappointing.

Second, I never got the banh mi sammich. They replaced my order with the saddest bbq char siu buns without even asking. No call to tell me they couldn't fulfill my order. I had to double-check to make sure this was the right order and the bag had my order number.

I know this pandemic has been tough so I was gonna look the other way and then I bit into these baos. One had the end of a skimpy lettuce parading around as the veggie counterpart. The pork itself was like stale jerky -- absolutely inedible. Buns were fine tho, sauce on them seemed alright.

I want to support local businesses but sadly won't be ordering from them again.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Ordered on doordash and it arrived super fast! Really enjoyed Nasi Lemak and pad thai..note that pad thai came with tofu only (didn't have other choices, which was fine).

I also ordered the spring rolls and roti canai..but they didn't fair well during the journey..even after I popped them in the toaster. The curry dipping for roti canai was a bit too thick, and there was no potato in there. I would recommend skipping those.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

LoveMama,"This Thai restaurant is decent. I went during lunch so ordered the lunch combo with pad Thai and the spring roll as my side. The ""side"" is kind of misleading since I was literally given just one tiny egg roll (wasn't even a spring roll which by definition is wrapped in rice paper). I also ordered a tom yum soup to share, and it was pretty tasty. The waiter and owners are very friendly people. I was wearing a white sweater, and the waiter told me to be careful while drinking the soup since the stains would be hard to get out if it splashed. Another man made friendly conversation with us, and I thought that was nice! The restaurant was pretty empty when I went for lunch though.

The pad thai was decent. Definitely wasn't the best pad thai I've had, but it wasn't terrible or anything. It was a little mushier than I would've liked but still had the right amount of flavors. Overall, I'm glad I came and tried this spot but probably won't come again. Great service and hospitality but food quality is only alright in my opinion.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I love that this place exists - you can get Thai, Malaysian, and Vietnamese food (although we opted for Thai). I came at 6PM on a Friday when there were few people, but the place quickly filled up. Rather than dining in, I'd order pickup or delivery from this place again.

I would skip the char siu buns. They weren't anything special, and the meat itself wasn't that soft or melt-in-your-mouth, so it was difficult to bite.

However, the entrees were great. We thoroughly enjoyed the pad see ew and Thai red curry. I'd order these two things again!

It seems that they got rid of their Yelp check-in offer of free Thai iced tea, likely because they have more than enough publicity from Yelp as it is.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Their food is of 5 star quality, but the service really hurt the overall experience. This place is terribly understaffed and we sat at a dirty table for ten minutes before it was cleaned... It took forever to get water, silverware, plates, etc... Despite this, their food was great and they had an impressive variety of options!

Tom Yum Soup (5/5): Their soup was very good. Plenty of veggies and shrimp and the brother was perfectly creamy and spicy.

Uncle Pump's Dumplings (5/5): These minced meat dumplings were delicious and very unique! They come in a dish covered in peanut sauce which was a great additional flavor! The dumplings themselves were tender, juicy, and chewy!

Pad See Ew (5/5): Their Pad See Ew really impressed us. Usually, Pad See Ew can be too oily and suffer from poorly cooked, dry meat. This Pad See Ew was oily but still incredibly good. The beef was plentiful and so tender!

Great food and poor service. I wanted to give this restaurant five stars but the lack of servers and the slow service prevented such a rating. Despite this, I will surely be back.

My friends and I loved it so much that one of them stood up and made a toast to MAMA (whoever she is).

The pad Thai here is just crazily well seasoned, bursting with flavors, but it's not oily. It's like the noodles themselves were pad Thai flavored. I also LOVE the big chunks of fried tofu in here. If you're not big into spicy food, ask them to scale it back bc I found myself struggling through it.

The other items that stood out were the pad see ew and roti canai. We also got the shrimp dumplings and veggie spring rolls, both of which were very standard. I'd pass on those next time.

I had the Mee Goreng and my friend ordered the Mixed Seafood Curry Laksa. The Mee Goreng was flavorful but most of the flavor rests at the top of the dish and several bites in the dish felt flat and just more oily than anything else. Towards the end I felt like the whole dish was very heavy. This definitely do not come close to my go-to Mee Goreng from Nyonya. My friend enjoyed her Seafood Curry Laksa but didn't think it was all that special.

The Pad Thai was peanuty and had a bit of sweetness to it. The Pad Kee Mao added a savory touch to our meal. They also offered foods from Vietnam and Malaysia.
The place is small and tight. I would recommend coming with small group. I came with a one other person. We were seated at a table with others pairs. If you have a large group trying coming during non-peak hours.
The service was efficient and quick. We pretty quickly upon arrival. The waiter came around with our drink and food order and we got a our food in 15 or so minutes. I would come back here the time I'm in the area.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

I kind of wish they specialised in just one cuisine but it's nice that they do offer Viet, Malay and Thai options.

We ordered the Sambal Belacan String Beans, Thai Style Papaya Salad, Roti Canai and the Beef Rendang Steak over Rice. Didn't have to wait long for all of our dishes to come out all at once.

Papaya salad - not as spicy as I had hope it would be. A bit lacking in flavour if I'm honest.

Sambal Balacan - not too salty, perfect mix of sambal and crispy just the way I like it.

Roti Canai - a bit different than the ones I've had at other Malaysian restaurants but it's still good nonetheless. It seems like they mashed the potatoes into the curry here and it's not spicy.

Beef Rendang Steak over Rice - my favorite dish out of all the ones we ordered. Steak wasn't over cooked, liberal quantity and pairs well with jasmine rice.

Overall, I would come back to this place again and maybe give the other cuisines they offer a try. The owner, Peter, is really nice and even offered us a small dish of their homemade Sambal. A+ for service!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"A must-try! Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, especially for this area, and the food doesn't disappoint. Staff here are super friendly too.

I ordered the BBQ buns to start which were just average. I probably wouldn't order next time. For my main, I ordered the Pad Kee Mao with chicken - so good! It's really flavorful and has a nice kick to it. If you like spicy, I'd highly recommend. Portions are generous - I had nearly half of my plate left and I was already full. Will definitely be back!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Great spot for an affordable South East Asian meal in the city! Manhattan has some notoriously expensive Asian food, but this spot has great homemade food that's tasty and quick service. I came here on a weekend around 8pm and didn't have to wait for a table. Our table ordered the roti, pad Thai, and the rendang. My favourite was the rendang, although I did find the meat a bit dry.

We spoke with the owner and he's absolutely lovely. Would highly recommend this place if you're craving some Malaysian food. They've also got Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese options.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Malay, Vietnamese and Thai style restaurant. Made reservations on Yelp, fully packed place as we got the last open table.

The seat and top of table were sticky and reeked of fish sauce. Service was a bit in disarray as they kept forgetting items that we had ordered.

Curries were watered down, tom yum very spicy, Pho had nice beef slices inside but the broth was bland, Kaffir lime lemongrass mussels overly spicy. And roti canai planta was just a thick paste not like what one would get in Malaysia or Singapore

The mango sticky rice and the cold noodles in sesame sauce excellent! Sadly that was 2 out of 9 items that were good.

Maybe an off night or the mad rush had them take shortcuts on quality.

Not sure I will be back.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I tried LoveMama for the first time on caviar. I was impressed that their prices were very reasonable, and the preparation/delivery time was prompt. The food was good, and they had many vegetarian options, but overall it was unmemorable. I got the vegetarian curry clay pot, one of the house specialties, and it was solid: a little spicy, and generous on the chunks of fried tofu. Probably more fun to eat out of a clay pot than out of the plastic tub, but I can't complain. Came with rice. The vegetable pad thai was the more disappointing dish. I selected the spiciest possible option (""extra spicy""), but in spite of there being some red powder sprinkled on top, it wasn't even a little spicy. And it came with literally three pieces of tofu.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"This place has some really good tasting food, in a small atmosphere. We went on a Sunday afternoon, and there were actually plenty of tables available.

We tried the Uncle Plump's Dumplings which was in a delicious sweet, peanut sauce. We also tried The Thai red curry which was very flavorful & different to the ones I've tried in the past. I would definitely recommend getting these dishes here!

I would not recommend getting the Taro bubble tea unless you have tried it without sugar in the past.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I've been to LoveMama a couple of times now and it has been consistently good. I've had their roti canai, pad see ew, Curry laksa, and a few apps. For the price, esp. since it's located in east village, the food is always a hit. It's nothing that I crave specifically but if I'm ever looking for a solid place to go, where I know I won't be disappointed, LoveMama comes to mind.

The reason it's not a 5 star for me is because it's not something I'm particularly enticed by. Sure it's good and the price isn't bad but it's not a place I actively am dying to go back to at any point. But again, a solid place if your hungry & looking for some yummy food.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"While visiting NYC, my friend and I were looking for a place to grab dinner.  We weren't really looking for anything in particular, and ended up finding this place.  We took a cab from our hotel, popped in at a weird time, like 430pm for dinner on a Saturday.  It was empty as expected, but it did fill up by the time we left.  Felt bad that we were still sitting there even though we were done because I got an unexpected phone call.

I ordered the chicken wings and the Pad See Ewe.  Both were flavorful and pretty delicious.  My friend got pad thai and some spring rolls.  She enjoyed both of them as well.

Overall, this is a great hole in the wall.  I can see why it gets packed during peak times.  It has a relatively small menu with popular items in each of the categories.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Ordered LoveMama for delivery this time and had a great experience. The Rendang Nasi Lemak was a little spicy for me, but the pad Thai was great. Also loved the Thai iced tea and sticky coconut rice. Food came quickly. Next time I want to try one of the curries!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I stopped by for a late dinner around 9:30pm on a Wednesday night. Decided to skip appetizers and just go for 3 different noodle dishes instead.

So we got the Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao & Pad See Eew with chicken, shrimp, beef so we could try all 3 variations. There weren't enough shrimps in the order that we got shrimp, I think only 4...

But all 3 dishes were great especially for around $13-$15 each. Pretty good portion sizes too so we took 1 dish to go. I definitely would recommend trying this place for a quick Thai or noodle craving if you're in the area.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Legit Asian cuisine.   We ordered Pork Chop, Pad Kee Mao, & Pad Kra Pow.    All Yummy and super tasty.  

Coming from LA where we have awesome Thai restaurants and having traveled recently to Thailand, we have a pretty high standard when it come to Thai food.  

When the plates were set with tiny saucers for plates, I had to request to give us larger plates.   My son and I were HUNGRY and were planning on a real meal.   So they obliged and with spoon and for in hand we dug in.  

OMG the food was the real deal.  So tasty and flavorful that we ordered another two cups of rice.  We were stuffed and still had a small bit for leftovers.   Our dinner here was probably the most cost to value meal we had in NYC.    For about $50, we had one of our most satisfying meals.    I would recommend Love Mama for anyone who Loves Thai food.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I should have been wary once I saw that this is one of those pan-Asian restaurants that offer many different types of cuisines (but none of them very well unfortunately). My boyfriend and I were lured here by the high number of reviews of good ratings but don't be fooled like we were. I do not recommend this place if you are craving really authentic asian cuisine of any type. Please note how some of the other reviews show that the owner will give free incentives for good reviews which could be inflating the rating on this restaurant.

What we ordered:
1. Chicken Pad Thai: Overly saucy with little authentic taste. There was no spice  and just a heavy, thick taste of sweet soy sauce.
2. Beef Rendang Lasi Nemak: Very salty with over-cooked, very chewy beef.
3. Tom Yum Soup: No lemongrass flavor at all :(

I would definitely not recommend this place.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"This place was an unusual mix of Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian/Singaporean food but I don't think they did any of them all that well.

We started with some roti with curry sauce and chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce and they were okay. They tasted like what you would get from a generic Thai place, nothing too special or over the topic.

For the main course I had to Luc Lac beef and I was a little disappointed by it. It was covered in this thick garlic soy sauce and while I love garlic and soy sauce, this was just too salty and unusual for the dish that it became not enjoyable.

I also had the lemon tea drink and it was a bit too sweet and could have been toned down a ton.

That being said the food here is pretty cheap, with most items being around $10 for the lunch special and $12-16 regularly.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"The worst drunken noodle that I have ever had (I travel a lot so I have had my fair share - CA, MD, DC, VA and RI). The food over was poor and tasteless. The only good things are the chicken satay and calamari.  The roti canal and drunken noodles are the worst. I always get drunken noodle cause I love it so much so I decided to try it at this place. I order it with shrimp and paid extra for chicken and there were only 3 shrimps in the entire food and I didn't see any chicken.  I have tried drunken noodle at 2 order places BKK on 34th street and Joya in Brooklyn. I thought that this would be good because of the high ratin but it was the worst. I guess the other food is good hence the high rating but I will not be going back to try it. Good luck to those trying to eat here just don't order the drunken noodle or roti canal. It was a waste of $15 for drunken noodles. I threw it away and I hate to throw away food but it was that bad. I can't say it enough, the worst.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Made a reservation for two people on a Saturday afternoon, which wasn't really necessary as the place still had plenty of seating available. Interior is reminiscent of a laid back Asian cafeteria/restaurant, and the menu follows suit.

After catching the waitress to get our order in, settled on the Roti Canai ($6) to share, Beef Nasi Lemak ($13), and a Hot Sake ($6). Food comes out very quickly, starting with the Roti Canai - a large well cooked piece of roti with a side of daal dipping sauce. On the oily side for sure, though not overwhelming and has good flavor. Nasi Lemak has several pieces of marinated beef alongside peanuts, carrots, cucumbers, a hardboiled egg, and jasmine rice. Meat is wonderfully tender and the spice hits the mark. For dessert, decided on the Mango Sticky Rice ($6) - a layer of pressed soft rice topped with mango and a sweet coconut cream sauce. Rice and coconut melded well together and had just enough sweetness. Mango was not ripe and was stringy to eat (not great).

Waitress is nice but had to flag her down several times to order food and to refill water. The price point here is good so will probably make a return trip to try other dishes.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Ordered shrimp pad Thai and beef pad see ew, both with medium spice. The pad Thai was slightly more spicy and the beef pad see ew was slightly less spicy than I wanted, but everyone agreed that the noodles tasted very fresh!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I came here on a Saturday for brunch around noon. With such a high rating on yelp I was surprised how empty it was. The service was great but I was hesitant on their menu items as the place was so empty. I was super hungry so decided to order a lot of food. Between two of us we ordered two entrees and two soups.

I was pleasantly amazed at how good the food was!! It was super cheap for New York price as well! The Tom yum soup was cooked to perfection. The noodle dishes has this smoky char taste which is different from most places. I personally really enjoyed the food and my boyfriend really loved everything as well.

My favorite part: the restaurant was so humble, we asked if we should get dumpling soup or just steamed dumplings. They answered with ""get the dumpling soup, it's more worth it for your money"". The chef also personally came out and asked if we enjoyed the food.

The restaurant actually got super packed as we were leaving around 1pm. Would come back again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"In another city, this would have been a 4 star review, but in NYC with so many Thai choices, I moved down on the sliding scale. LoveMama no doubt has a popular and loyal following so i was eager to try it while in NY recently for work.

The place is the general atmosphere of hole in the wall Thai, complete with peeling wall paint and communal seating that is crammed way too close together. Some people mind, but I find it tends to add to the experience. Servers run around frantic to get to everyone in the restaurant while still managing a high volume take out order flow.

The menu is not as expanded as traditional Thai places and it offers a selection of Malaysian dishes in addition to Thai. I opted for the cashew chicken and the pad prik. The cashew chicken was disappointing and tasted nothing like the typical flavors of this dish. The flavors were more curry in taste and almost reminded me of an Indian dish. The thai basil was heaven and I ate every bite. Wok fried to perfection so that everything was just crispy enough without overkill. The sauce flavor was heaven.

Had i ordered the thai basil alone this review would have been a 5 star. But the chicken cashew was a disappointment.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Do not come here! We came here because of all of the amazing reviews. We traveled south east Asia last summer and were really missing some authentic food. First of all, it's nowhere near the level of authenticity nyc should have. It seemed preprepared or something. My girlfriend is vegetarian and had BONES in her nasi goreng. That is not okay.

The food was delicious and similar to how it's done in Malaysia.  The prices are quite affordable!  It is quite spicy, but maybe that's just me, so you can ask them to tone it down if you're a mild spicy type like me.

The owner and waiter was friendly and asked us how the food was which was all delicious!

I'd give it a 5 star rating if the restaurant was a bit cleaner (leftover food on floor etc).  Other than that, I'll come back!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

LoveMama,"Just bad pre-prepared food. I came in around 5 on a weekday and the restaurant was empty. You seat yourself and you can grab a menu from the pile right when you walk in. We ordered pork vermicelli noodles, rendeng nasi lemak, and the roti canai. Out of the three I preferred the roti canai but it's definitely not the best. The dishes weren't hot when they came out and they came out very quickly meaning my food wasn't fresh. My friend avoided the noodles and just ate the pork while the beef for the rendeng nasi lemak was tough and the rice looked like it was sitting out for a while. Overall unpleasant experience with the food and service and I didn't really care for the interior either. Do not recommend.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Came here for dinner on Friday. There wasn't a wait. Was skeptical about this place as its a fusion asian place for Thai, Vietnamese, Malaysian, and more and fusion places are never good.

The food was surprisingly good! We got the Beef Pad Siew and the Roti Canai. It was pretty expensive for the small/medium portion size. But the food was good.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"My friend and I checked out LoveMama around 6pm on a Friday.  They do not take reservations during this time, but it was not that busy!  If you can, this would be a good time to come.  The restaurant was never more than halfway full between 6pm-7:15pm.  The ambiance is like a casual diner, which matches the theme of homestyle cooking.  

We ordered the Thai shumai dumpling ($6), pad see ew ($12) with beef (+$2), and the mixed seafood curry laksa ($13).  Pricing is competitive with other places in the city.  When my friend's dumplings came out, all I could focus on was that they were really small.  For $6, I would pick a more filling appetizer.  My friend had a Thai craving and either eats pad thai and pad see ew, and she liked her meal but said there was nothing distinctive or special about it.  I enjoyed the laksa.  There is definitely a kick to it, but it was not overwhelming, so I was able to taste flavor beyond the spice.  My one critique is that I didn't get the variety of seafood I was expecting (just mussels and shrimp).

I was pleasantly surprised by the service here.  Our server did multiple check-backs and refilled our waters.  I do think LoveMama cares a lot about it's Yelp reputation, so they do strive to provide good customer service.  Overall, I see LoveMama as a solid choice that covers a variety of cuisines.  While nothing was mind-blowingly amazing, it's a place I would return to!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

LoveMama,"Good causal reasonably priced food.

My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and got chicken char kwa teow and the beef rendang nasi lemak. We've never had Malaysian food, so we were intrigued by all the options on the menu. The char kwa teow kinda tasted a little bit like pad see ew. The rendang nasi lemak was pretty good, a tad spicy. The coconut rice and peanut pickled carrots and Thai papaya went really well with it. Overall pretty good.

But since we both have never had Malaysian food before, I'm not sure what they should taste like. It tasted good to me, but I think I'd want to try their Thai and Vietnamese dishes to really be able to give this place an accurate rating though.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I don't know. I have a love-hate thing going on for LoveMama. The food is good, but not as scrumptious as the lines out the door make it seem.

The pros with food - if you like spicy, you will get spicy; the seasoning, serving, and smell is as authentic as it may get.

The cons - a bit too authentic, I.e. served on chipped off plates, surrounding is hectic and cramped; servers aren't the most calming sight and are pretty much on top of you as they scramble to get to the table behind you; there are huge packets of something I forget now (flour?) all around the wall taking up even more space.

Roti canai - I would skip next time. The roti is actually those Malaysian pre-packaged, frozen ones you can find at a Supermarket and the dipping sauce was meh.

Pad See Eew was my favorite item on the table. Good flavor.

Beef Rendang gave me a very home-cooked vibe but was way too spicy and oily for me. The taste was great for a few bites but I wasn't able to handle the oil and spice.

They also have some great Vietnamese iced coffee ! Out of everything ordered, the coffee left me with a lasting taste.

I would probably try it again if I was in the area during off-peak hours.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"A place that sells Vietnamese, Malaysian AND Thai cuisine?? ALRIGHTY let's check this baby out!

I came by on a Friday afternoon at 1pm with my friend after finishing a yoga session. This place is cozy and slightly dim, perfectly for an intimate meal. There were about 5 other tables being served on a Friday, so that was a good sign. We decided to order the $10 lunch special, which included either one spring roll or two ""dumplings"" (which were actually shumai). I decided to get the Rendang Nasi lemak and my friend ordered the Curry Laksa. You can order both dishes with veggies or with chicken for no extra charge. Shrimp/beef require an additional surcharge.

I HIGHLY recommend the Rendang Nasi Lemak. While the curry laksa was a 7.5/10, the Rendang Nasi Lemak was a solid 10/10. It tasted so good and I cannot wait to have it again!! The dish is spicy, definitely enough to give you a little kick without it being overpowering. I've never ordered this dish before and the best way to describe it is like a savory, spicy, meaty ensemble. It was so good!! I tried the curry laksa and although it wasn't bad, j seriously just wanted to keep eating the Rendang Nasi Lemak. The appetizer that came with the meals were solid. You can either get 1 spring roll or 2 shumais, which I actually preferred.

The thing that really gives this place 5 stars is definitely the owner. Upon entering, the store manager definitely took a liking to my friend after finding out that she is from Taiwan. I listened with my limited Mandarin to them share their backgrounds and even the current state of political affairs. He was so sweet and even came out with his iPad to show my friend his favorite television show!!! I think that there aren't too many people that shared his interests so he and my friend definitely bonded for a short awhile there. Later, I'm guessing he liked my friend so much that he gave us Thai iced tea on the house! Woo! Talk about a sweet manager!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,Random restaurant that i came across after picking up some furniture. Staff were great and we got our food quickly.

Have to come back again to try their other options.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Excellent Thai and Malaysian food by a mom and pop shop!

Ambiance - Looks very authentic, complete with random cardboard boxes on the side (lol).  I imagine this is what places in the old country look like... Probably seats around 20-30 people total.  I saw quite a few people coming for take out while we were there.

Wait staff - Our waiter at first seemed put off by us, just pointing to a table to sit at (how NY) but afterward he was cordial enough.  There were two other men working there, I think one was the owner and the other was the cook.  Since there weren't that many patrons in-house, the food came out super quick.

Food - Main entrees were amazing!  We had the chicken pad thai and the mi goreng.  Both very flavorful, portion size was also good.  We got an appetizer of roti canai though which was less than stellar.  The roti was as expected but the sauce it came with was maybe 3 tablespoons total and I usually see it come in a small dish with some pieces of chicken.  This was more of a mushy paste.  Tasty but not nearly enough and I wanted some meat!  This annoyed me enough to drop it down a star...

Overall this Thai restaurant was pretty good",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

The rendang nasi lemak had good flavor and rice but the beef was extremely dry and tough, otherwise it would have been a solid dish. The pad thai had no redeeming qualities, unfortunately. The noodles were stale and tasted burnt, the few pieces of chicken it came with were oddly chewy and on the verge of going bad, and the traditional flavor of pad thai just wasn't there.

Sadly, I do not think I will be ordering from here again.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Food:

Roti Canai Planta - nothing special - the roti was kind of soggy and not crispy and soft on the inside
Pad Thai - Really really mehhh, I've have way better
Curry Pinneapple Fried Rice - tasted like any regular plain old fried rice

I'm not sure what the hype is with this place. Nothing really stood out. Everything was average at most. It was pretty busy for a Saturday night. Service was pretty good though.

Shrimp tom yum- really good shrimp. Big, plump, juicy. Good flavor broth. Not very spicy.

Papaya salad- good flavor, soggy, mild heat.

Chicken pho- juicy chicken, not that good of broth, very salty. Would not recommend.

I wish they had had shrimp tom yum noodle soup, that was by far my favorite dish. Although i had asked for extra spicy and none were really that spicy. Not sure if i'll come back again, there are better places nearby.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Breaks my heart to write this bad review but Love Mama overcharged my credit card and denied to do so when I presented them with the receipt I had signed for $88. The original receipt they had given me was written in Chinese totaling to $98 (charging me for things we did not get). I had them redo a receipt in English with the correct things we ordered totaling $88 which I signed off on.... we tipped 25% in CASH after the error they made because mistakes happen...

A week later I noticed my credit card was charged for $98 the amount I did not sign off on....I went back to the owner showing him the receipt I saved which I signed off and my bank statement. He kept yelling at me and saying I should take it up with my bank and get it adjusted and there was nothing he could do..... I gave him another chance and asked him if I dined there again if he can do something for us he refused again. I didn't make it a big fuss but he just lost a ton of business because I was going to refer my clients here. Terrible costumer service, the place is not clean. The food was good but I am not going to come back.

What brought me here were the reviews that raves how great this place was. I'd rather dine at SriPraPhai and Pye Boat Noodle (Amazing Thai Food there & service!)

LoveMama,"Its an interesting idea to have 3 kinds of Asian specialties all at one restaurant. But you gotta wonder, is it possible everything on the menu good?

was not too busy Friday night when we got a table which was convenient. Ordered the Roti Canai, Pork Vermicelli, and house special noodle soup.
The roti canai was crispy and flakey and the dipping sauce was an excellent compliment. Pork vermicelli had that nice smokey flavor while being caramelized quite well on the outer layer of the pork.

The only thing I thought was rather mediocre was the pho. I should have guessed that every dish could not be up to the same level of quality. I found myself adding alot of sriracha and hoisin  sauce in search of some flavor. Overall the pho was passable.

I feel like i ordered the wrong thing here, I really enjoyed the other two dishes. Maybe ill have to give this place a shot again when i am in the area",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Does LoveMama live up to the hype? Hell Yea.
Should you go and order the Kaffir Lime Lemongrass Mussels dish? YOU BETTER! That is a must-try dish PERIOD. The flavor of the sauce was so incredibly good that you will feel guilty wasting the sauce. So you will order an extra bowl of rice just to mop it up and get another taste. And yes, THAT'S A POWER MOVE!  

We came as a group of ten and despite the place was PACKED with people, the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. They were able to make a table for us within 30 minutes! It is these small things that set a difference between a good restaurant and a great restaurant.

With so many people we pretty much sampled their whole menu. LoveMama offers three different cuisines, Thai, Vietnamese, and Malay. And for someone who just got back from all three of these countries, I can say, I was not disappointed.

The food was so good, it compelled a white girl from some European country to stand up midway through her meal to make a toast to Mama. True story and sorry, I was in a state of confusion/shock that I forgot to film it. #liveinthemoment",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Usually I'm skeptical about places that serve multiple ethnicities, however this restaurant does a great job of keeping consistent flavors and keeping each dish true to its nationality of origin.

I came here with the group of Five people on a weeknight and it was still very busy. They do not take reservations but it's well worth the wait. The restaurant itself is not very big but tables to open up pretty quickly, we only waited about 15 to 20 minutes which is not bad for city standards. The highlight of our dishes was the pad Thai, pork buns and A spicy seafood noodle dish that we couldn't find on the menu but saw that everyone else was trying. The pork buns particularly on that day were extremely tasty, with a perfectly grilled spicy pork and Asian style barbecue sauce on a very light and fluffy bun.

- Uncle Plump's Dumplings: Delicious and def plumped! They were shaped like wontons with very thin wrapping packed with juicy pork. The sauce was definitely the highlight. It was nutty, savory with a little heat from the chili oil. GET IT!!!

- Rendang Nasi Lemak: Average. The beef rendang was rich but not as spicy as I would've liked. It paired nicely with the fragrant coconut pandanus jasmine rice. The pickled vegetables, peanuts and egg added extra flavors and textures.

- Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles): Yum! It was very comforting. The noodles were soft yet chewy. There was a good amount of chicken and vegetables. You can really taste the sweet savory soy sauce but again, it's not as spicy as I'm more used to.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"My review is as brief as our encounter.  Our party shared a roti canai while we waited for a friend.  The dough was overworked and greasy, worse than a freezer pre-made one.  The curry was flavorless.  Also the server was a bit huffy, so we paid our bill and went elsewhere.

I am always skeptical of a restaurant with multiplicity of  regional Asian dishes on a menu.  Maybe the entrees are better but I will never know...",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

LoveMama,"Went here for a late Mother's Day dinner when our mum came to town, and I can't even emphasize how amazing the food was! It was a tad on the oily side, but so so authentic!
Loved everything so much, and the manager and waiters were so helpful in picking out the best dishes, service was also SUPER quick! Will definitely be visiting again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"If you're looking through yelp and wondering where to eat, do yourself a favor and eat here.
I'm not trying to hype this place up but the food here was AMAZING!!!!! The red curry was the best curry I've ever had in my life (including what I ate in Thailand).

Service 10/10
Food we ordered:
Papaya salad
Muscles
Roti
Red curry
Fried rice

The dishes came out quick and were each better than the last. The food was so good I forgot to take a picture when it came out!

Again you will not be disappointed!!!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I went to LoveMama for dinner and ordered the Char Kwa Teow. It is basically the Malaysian version of Pad See Ew. It was good, but I personally prefer Pad See Ew because I thought this dish had less of a tasty mixture of flavors that Pad See Ew normally has. The portion size was decent. For $12, this was a good deal.

The service at LoveMama was exceptional. The owner was super nice and even gave us free Thai iced tea! The waitresses are also very friendly. There is both indoor and outdoor seating at the restaurant. The decor is standard in quality.

Overall, LoveMama has good food with friendly service (especially the owner). I would recommend it to anyone looking for Southeast Asian food in the East Village.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Came to NY for the first time and this place was one of the top restaurants we ate at! Their customer service is great and the food, THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. The flavors were bursting in each dish, so many flavors but not overwhelming. The noodles are cooked perfectly~ I like mine al dente to be chewy. The portions are more than enough! Definitely the most from any Thai place I've been to.

Overall, 10/10 would recommend",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I stopped by here at 9:30pm on a weeknight and was a bit skeptical by the amount of reviews. But it was surprisingly really good! I decided to skip the appetizers and order three noodle dishes instead.

I got the pad Thai, pad kee mao and pad see ew and all the dishes were around $13-$15. The portion sizes were pretty good size and would definitely recommend this place if you have Thai food noodle craving!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Came here yesterday for dinner with a larger group of friends! They take reservations which is great but the place itself is pretty tight so moving around might be a little hard! I've never been to this place before but was pleasantly surprised with their menu items ranging from Thai, viet to Malay! We got appetizers to share- spring rolls, plump dumplings, calamari, chicken wings, and roti! The appetizers can out fairly quickly and all were pretty good! I think my favorite were their dumplings- it had peanut sauce and something else mixed in. Their calamari was quite spicy and I was sweating from the piece I ate but it was delicious; nicely seasoned, just very spicy! Their chicken wings were also marinated well and it was sweet/tangy! As for my dish, I ordered the mixed seafood curry laksa- it looked really good and I've been addicted to curry lately however it was soo spicy my fiancé had to eat it for me and I took his pad see ew! He said it was good but just in the spicy side! A few people ordered pad Thai which I heard was also quite spicy too- LoveMama def loves serving their dishes on the spicier side, which is fine but I wish I knew! Overall, food was pretty good except for the fact that most was spicier than we expect!
A few of us checked in- one of my friends had a yelp offer for a free Thai tea upon checking in but I didn't even after I checked in but the worker was nice enough to give the Thai tea out to the entire table!!
I will be back next time to try their other dishes (hopefully the non spicy ones) and the owners were nice so will come back to again!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I was really excited to try this place because of all the good reviews! My sister and I are visiting from Los Angeles, which has its share of amazing Thai and Vietnamese establishments. I ordered the vegetable pad see ew (no egg) and my sister got the chicken pad Thai. Unfortunately my dish was overly greasy and salty so I couldn't taste the noodles much. My sister liked her dish, and after trying it, it tasted better than my fish (not as salty or greasy).

When I tried to ask the person taking out order about not using too much oil, he made a big deal about it and said something about not using oil. Not the case in my dish. Our food also arrived before our drinks, which again wasn't great because of how salty it all was.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

The food is super greasy after dinner I didn't feel good at all. Not sure how this restaurant has 4.5 stars.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"This is my second time eating here. I love coming here for the delicious food!

The Food: 5 out of 5
Delicious Southeast Asian food with the menu split in 3 sections: Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian. I really like their Rendang Nasi Lemak and their Pad Thai. I forgot what else we got during our first time here, but it was legit both times!

The Service: 4.5 out of 5
The owner is super nice and came around to check on us. The waiter and waitress came by frequently and got our food out very quickly.

The Space: 4.5 out of 5
They have both indoor and outdoor seating. Relatively small restaurant, and it can get busy, but they do take reservations.

The Price: $$

Worth it? Yup!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Great place to go with friends, amazing ambience, very warm and welcoming host.
The food was amazing as well!
The hygiene could be improvised a little but in their favour today's Christmas & we went at peak hours. Id definitely go back to this place!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Cute little place in the city that has average priced Vietnamese/Malaysian/Thai food for NYC. If you are indecisive like I am, come check out the different cuisines that Love Mama offers - Viet, Malay, and Thai all in one menu?? Amazing if you ask me! If you check on Yelp, they'll also give you free thai iced tea! Yum!

The food comes out quickly and their service is impeccable. LoveMama has been around for awhile and every time I've gone (four times now), they are quick, efficient, and have good food.

I have never ordered from the Vietnamese section but I can definitely recommend the mee goreng and the pad thai. Both were flavorful and were not too oily. I will say the portion sizes were not big or small but if you have a big appetite, it may not be enough for you.

Overall, would come back again if I was in town.

Price: 3/5

I want to come back and try some other dishes next time I am in NYC.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"This is probably will be one of my favorite Malaysian restaurant.
We ordered Roti canai, and delicious nasi lemak with beef rendang, mee goreng, and special tumeric mussel.. and don't forget to order ""teh tarik"" it's really good!

*My fave is the tumeric mussel and nasi lemak

The server and owner was so nice..",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I had high hopes for this restaurant. It had a lot of my favorite foods on the menu and the prices were very cheap. However, this experience was awful. I went in thanksgiving with my sister. It was a busy night, but after reading some of these other reviews, the BS I went through happens all the time.

We walked in and were seated. The whole place is entirely cramped. There was no clear route to the seat they sat me at. I had to circle around the restaraunt to get to the only walking space big enough to squeeze to my seat ... and I'm tiny. They need to remove several tables because this has gottttttt to be a fire hazard or something.

After we were seated our server forgot us and never looked back. As we were sitting, waiting patiently for our drink order to be taken, a couple was seated next to us. Still waiting for a server. After a few minutes, a server comes to the couple seated next to us and takes their order!! Everytime a server passed by, I tried to flag them down but they would just rush by and help someone else. I was ready to get up and leave but we had came so far to be there. The wild thing is when I server finally acknowledged us, she came over asked us what we want, turned to the table behind us to do something I don't know while my sister was ordering. Didn't hear a word my sister said of course. It was completely rude. After we ordered, they brought my sisters appetizer out alone. She entirely finished her appetizer and mine still didn't come out. At some point she just had to eat because it was getting cold. The gag is, when they finally brought my appetizer out, they gave me like 30 seconds to eat it because they immediately went back brought our entrees out. There wasn't even room on their tiny tables for an entree and an appetizer both. The timing was awful.

For an appetizer, I got the mussels. The flavor was very good, but they definitely overcooked them. For an entree, I got the pad see ew with both beef and shrimp. The dish was underwhelming. I love pad see ew, I get it all the time. This one wasn't right. It tasted like the great value version. I also didn't like the shrimp they used. Overall, the food was mediocre.

I got the free Thai tea with my meal that you get from checking it with yelp. It was small, but it tasted good. There was, however, ground black tea at the bottom that should have been strained...

Halfway through my meal, my water is gone. No server in sight to refill it. Spoiler alert. My water didn't get refilled for the duration of the night.

We just wanted to leave. Getting the check was another battle. We were getting split checks but couldn't because my server simply never came. I had to mouth it from halfway across the room. If we got up and left, I don't even think they'd notice. They crazy thing is, the table next to us was getting normal service. I'm not a rude person. I was pleasant since I walked in... yet.

If it was any other day I would have left within the first 15 minutes. Terrible.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,Seriously wonderful food and worth a walk from any corner of the city.  Food is tasty but not over spiced and the staff is warm and inviting.  It's pretty small so make sure you can get a table or just take it home!!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Lots of seating, great service, and good food. If you're close by definitely worth checking out.

It's also a place good for groups. They have a menu with viet, Malay, and Thai food. Definitely something for everyone.

What was most impressive, was the execution of the food. You can taste from the food, the high heat they must be using in the back kitchen. Like some kind of magic wok - my pad Thai noodles were fried in a way that it was tender, but I can kinda taste the crisp outside.

It was on the bit spicier side for me, but still
Manageable. I've never had a pad Thai Spicy like that, good thing the waiter already said he would tell chef to make it less Spicy",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Not much from the outside and when walking in, was a bit nervous that we were the only table inside. But as a new Thai food fan, the food was SO good. We got the roti which was flaky and warm, papaya salad was so refreshing and spicy at the same time, chicken pad Thai was a great portion and red curry with chicken which was sweet and also really good. We had no complaints about our food at all and I definitely would go back to try some more!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I'm usually a bit wary of going to restaurants that have multiple different cuisines, but LoveMama really is able to make good Thai food, Vietnamese food, and Malaysian food. We came here on a cold rainy day, which for us was nice because there was no wait like there usually would be. The food was nice and warm and filling and made us very happy and the workers were very nice.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I came here today for lunch because it's very close to where I live, and I was shocked at the 4K+ review count. They sell a variety of Asian cuisines, so I had a difficult time choosing what to order.

The owners speak Cantonese, and they treated me well. The male owner asked me to leave a review and made time for small talk. Service was decent, but they weren't particularly attentive. It was a busy meal time, so I understand. I was also by myself, and I didn't require much assistance.

I ordered the Pad Kee Mao with beef (extra $2), and it was definitely a familiar taste. It's nothing special, but the beef was tender and not chewy. If you check in on Yelp, you get a free Thai iced tea, so I took advantage of the offer. However, the Thai iced tea is probably the worst I've had at a food establishment thus far. It was incredibly watery and flavorless. I'm not sure if I got a bad batch of the tea.

I've read some of the other reviews here and it seems like there are many other good food options to try, so I'm definitely willing to come back and order something else! The environment was lively, and food came out quickly.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Honestly this place is amazing, love how you can mix and match between three very distinct style of south Asian cuisine. (Thai, Vietnamese, Malaysian)

We had the pad Thai and Malaysian curry. Very reasonable price wise as well ($10-$13).
Beers are $5-$7
Both were delicious and well spiced. Not to hot or over powering.

The wait can be long and they don't have reservations, it's very popular and can get chaotic during dinner time.

Over it's a great place for friends and getting casual drinks.

Highly recommend it. Very cozy, delicious, and homely restaurant.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Because of the name, I decided this would be appropriate, among my list of Yelp bookmarks, for an early mother's day lunch.
We had the:
-shrimp summer roll: good, standard. Would have liked nuoc cham sauce with it (in addition to the peanut sauce) like some other places serve.
-Malaysian chicken satay skewers: good, oilier than others I have had.
-Mango shrimp: good flavor
-Mixed seafood curry laksa: very good flavor. Didn't have as much seafood as I expected compared to previous pictures; only 4 mussels and 4 half shrimps (=2 whole shrimp).

Customer service: very, very lack luster. There were only 2-4 people there throughout our lunch but we still got minimum service. The waiter was preoccupied with peeling veggies so barely paid attention ti us and on top of that, whenever he came to us he seemed like he didn't even want to be there.

Overall the food was good and the service was substandard. Food is on par with other Vietnamese/Thai restaurants so not sure why there is a specific hype(so many reviews) for this place; I would guess because NYU is close and this is an affordable option for student-budgets probably leading to a snowball effect of people like me going due to so many good reviews.
Would not go out of my way at all to come here. You can get same food, better service and more elegant ambiance at other restaurants.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I went out of my way to grab an order from here for dinner. Ordered the flank steak and got my husband the chow kaw teow with beef. I didnt get to try his dish but mine was yummy. It was loaded with minced garlic and covered with sauce (prominent of hoisin). It reminded me of viets beef cube over rice. Delicious! It's a bit pricey though. The dish cost close to 20 bucks while if you get the chance to go to chinatown and get it for maybe half the price. It's great for the area. The owner was super nice and he made me feel like a regular. Unfortunately, I'm not in the area often. I would recommend it! I think their malaysian food would be superb!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"After reading all the great reviews, decided to make a stop here since it wasn't too far from our hotel. This place offers Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian food. We decided to stick to Malaysian food since we don't have too many options for that in DC. Here are the dishes we ordered:

Roti canai planta: This appetizer was so good! Def recommend. We had a little bit of roti left over and used it to dip into the nasi lemak. So tasty - must have.

Rendang nasi lemak: We got the beef option. The beef was soo tender and flavorful. There are big pieces of spices so be aware of that. Recommend this dish.

Mee goreng: This noodle dish was good and had a nice kick too it. If we get it again, I would prob not opt for the chicken addition. It think it's fine with just the tofu. It was good, but can't see myself craving it.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"The food and service were pretty good, but overall I'd have to say our experience was very average in comparison to our expectations coming in (given the 4.5 stars on Yelp). The online menu is different than what you get in the restaurant - so keep in mind they are only serving Thai, Malaysian, and Vietnamese food. You can scratch any of the Chinese options which makes up at least 30% of the online menu.

Uncle Plump's Dumplings - tasty & recommend if you like peanut sauce
Vietnamese Spring Rolls - not like traditional Vietnamese spring rolls. some were a bit oily. could skip this one.
Tom Yum lemongrass soup - good, loaded with shrimp!
Shrimp pad kee mao - good

We made the mistake of ordering the mango sticky rice for dessert since it looked so good in photos. Certainly don't waste your time on this - mango was not close to being ripe (couldn't even get your fork through it) and the sticky rice was over-saturated in condensed milk and all clumped together in one wet mound.

The owner was kind and I liked that he was present, but he did ask to write a good Yelp review which came off as disingenuous.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Five Spice Crispy Calamari, BBQ Char Siu Bun, Vietnamese Vegetable Summer Roll, Roti Canai Planta
And the Passion Fruit Shake!

Everything is super fresh- the calamari was perfectly crispy outside, soft and juicy inside. The roti is delicious.

I've come here many times throughout the years. It's my favorite asian restaurant in the city. They do everything with love and the food always hits the spot.

Get the coconut-turmeric rice.
Also the Vietnamese grilled pork is delicious!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"A super lovely mom and pop shop. Food is legita heaven for spicy food lover.

We ordered wings, fried calamari, pad Thai, laksa and some other items. Everything tastes really really good. Laksa is a bit too spicy for me, but the waiter noticed immediately and gave me an extra bowl of chicken soup.  

Service is great too. Everyone is attentive and catering.

Would come back and recommend my friends to come too!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,This is my 2nd time here and I've enjoyed both experiences. I would definitely recommend coming here during their lunch hours since they have great $10 lunch special deals here. You get to choose a Thai roll or Thai dumplings as your appetizer + an entree of your choice. Most entrees are either chicken or vegetarian. No beef or anything else special unfortunately. I enjoyed the Thai dumplings - they are like the HK style sui mai at dimsum. I had the nasi lemak chicken version. It was quite spicy and flavorful.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

I ordered the Pad See Ew and the chicken was so tender!! I can't even remember the last time I've had chicken that soft. The portion size was also perfect. Other Thai places I've been to have entrees that are way too much for me, but I cleaned up my plate here and was comfortably full. The waiter also gave me a free Thai Iced Tea for no reason, which was really nice. I see why this place has great reviews.

LoveMama,"As soon as we were sat I immediately recognized that this is the kind of place you should get delivered. The food was great but the service left much to be desired.

There was one woman whirling around doing her best. I heard her go to the back and yell for reinforcements and a guy comes out that clearly is not thrilled with the tasks before him. I told him I had never had Malaysian food before and said I was between two dishes and let it hang in the air for a suggestion and he just stared at me until I made a decision. Okay... the food arrives and we didn't have utensils for a while.

We ordered a Thai curry which comes with rice at every other establishment I have ever ordered curry. Not here, an extra $3. I did enjoyed the curry and everything else we ordered, the calamari, tom yum soups and the Malaysian dish too.

Great food, I would just suggest you eat it in your apartment.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Please the the pictures attached (we ordered the Tom Yum soup, mixed seafood curry Laksa, Kao Prao Basil Sauce and the Malay spring rolls. The flavor is to die for! It's so rich and complex. The spice is just right. Even the wok does its work perfectly here. It gives the Kao Prao just the right amount of flavor.

The price is very good for the experience and the staff are very friendly. Also, my boyfriend is a chef. I trust his taste buds. He has been to Thailand twice and this little spot takes him right back :)

LoveMama,"Came here again recently with my friend for dinner. It was actually not super crowded and we managed to get seated right away.

My friend got the honey pork chop with rice (which was a pretty big portion) while I got the nasi lemak. I feel like I was a little misled, because I asked them what was something really spicy/ what was the spiciest thing on the menu- they replied it was the nasi lemak. The nasi lemak, however, is really not spicy at all. Like, in theory, I can taste the spiciness, but it really isn't spicy for people who enjoy spicy food.

Still, the dish was really good. There is a reasonable amount of beef (you can also get chicken), and the sauce is a nice compliment. I also got a vietnamese iced coffee which I probably wouldn't get again. It wasn't mixed too well for some reason, and some parts were super sweet, while others were not at all. In addition, I'm not wild about the coffee flavor.

Still, this is really a good restaurant overall. Come for the lunch specials for a better deal! Next time, I would like to try the pad kee mao.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

This time I got the Rendang Nasi Lemak. The main sauce was good, whereas the smaller sauce (sambal chiles?) was, in the words of Bobby Moynihan's Guy Fieri impersonation, off the hook. The menu encompasses Thai and Vietnamese fare but my guess is first-timers will find more rewards in the Malaysian section.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

I proceeded to order online, but the ordering site FORCED me to choose a meat option. I am a vegetarian, so I chose chicken then put in the requests section please do NOT add chicken and I'd like extra veggies instead of chicken. I also asked for less spice. Low and behold, they give me an order made up of MOSTLY chicken (bad quality chicken at that) AND it was spicy. Also SUPER OILY. I'd also ordered this food for my birthday today.

DH and I stopped by on a weekday night for a quick dinner and were seated right away.  Although moderately busy, service was quick and friendly. We ordered the roti canai, vegetarian pad see eew and Chicken Pad Thai.  All dishes were delicious, I especially liked the roti because it was crispy without being too fried.  Still doughy enough to bite into and absorb the curry.  Food came out without much of a wait, hallelujah! I was hungry and in our usual fashion, DH and I ate everything .

So many people coming in and out, they were understaffed so service can be slow and the place gets loud. The menu offers so many different items varying from Vietnamese, Thai to Malaysian and I love the options. Ordered the mee goreng and it was pretty good, very saucy but also sort of smoky. A flavor I wasn't use to, but equally delicious.

LoveMama,"I guess my experience goes against the grain given LoveMama's tremendous reviews, but I was disappointed that I came here and spent $12 or $13 on mediocre Thai food when I could've gone to an authentic Thai restaurant and spent the same amount of money. I ordered the pad see ew and, while it wasn't bad, per se, something just wasn't right. I want to say that it might have something to do with the fact that the employees were speaking Cantonese (and thus may not be from Thailand), and the fact that it seems strange for a single restaurant to serve Thai, Malaysian, and Vietnamese food, but hey, maybe I'm wrong.

I also had to deduct a star because service was abysmal. When you check in, you get a free small Thai iced tea. I showed the coupon to our waiter when he took our orders, and he acknowledged it and nodded, and then it never came. We actually didn't see him again for the rest of the evening as someone else brought our food to the table, so that was that. No checking up on us, no small talk or asking how we were, in fact there wasn't even a hello. Strange.

Next time I'm craving Vietnamese, Thai, or Malaysian, I'll likely just go to a Vietnamese, Thai, or Malaysian restaurant. Despite LoveMama being packed on a Saturday night, I just didn't love being there.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"While this place may look a little dingy and dirty, don't let this look fool you. The food here is actually amazing. There are seats outside on a nice fall day. We had the roti canai and the dumplings as appetizers. We then shared two main dishes one is the nasilamak and the other one is grilled pork vermicelli. I saw that a table next to me had a guy that ordered two roti canai for himself and thought that I had to order it. It was very delicious! The dumplings were very good served in creamy peanut sauce. Both main dishes were also very good. They had a small selection of wine and beer so this is not a place to get drinks but you'll definitely get yummy food here!!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Place is overhyped.  Went on a Wednesday for dinner, place was empty.  Food is mediocre as per my standards.  

Ordered most of the items marked at Specialties, nothing to write home about.

Roti canai was dripping with butter - the accompanying curry was not that great - have had much better.  

Tom Yum soup was pretty good.

Everything else was soso

We skipped dessert.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"What's not to love about LoveMama? The food is comforting and it's one of those spots that is always full and flowing with good energy.

Uncle Plumps Dumplings ($6) - Don't judge these on aesthetics. As David Chang puts it, these are ugly delicious. The combo of PB sauce, soy, and pork filled dumplings just works.

Pad Kee Mao ($13) - This is my benchmark dish for Thai spots and LoveMama's did not disappoint. The veggies aren't overcooked so they still have that crunch and there's plenty of fresh basil. They don't skimp on the protein either. It's tough to branch out and try new dishes since they get it right every time.

Mango Sticky Rice ($6) - I could honestly polish two of these off on my own. So good. Perfect balance of sweet, tangy, and creamy.

Thai iced tea ($4) - Love that a mini version is on the house when you check in! It's not overly sweet like many drinks with condensed milk end up being. It's not as fragrant as other versions I've tried, but still a nice treat regardless.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Really great place! We ordered the Roti Planta and crab rangoons for appetizers, the rendang nasi lemak and shrimp pad kee mao for the meal. It was delicious!

It's a family owned restaurant and everyone was extremely nice. The food came out really fast too!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"""If the ambiance is TOO nice,"" Peter the energetic owner of LoveMama is telling me, ""Your first thought is going to be 'uh-oh, can I afford this place?' I don't want that.""

He shakes his head and I find myself shaking my head with him.  It's hard to resist his persuasive arguments.

He continues, ""I want you to relax.  You know you'll get good food at a cheap price. See that place over there?"" He points out the window and I follow his finger to the sushi bar across the street.  ""You can't eat there for less than $60 per person.""

We both shake our heads again.  

Obviously Peter has given his market positioning strategy some thought.  It's working.  LoveMama is packed at 6pm with no end in sight.  Just as one table leaves a new group arrives to take their place.  The setup is mix-and-match and fluid. Two tables pushed together here to accommodate four people.   When two more people arrive to join the group, another table gets pushed in with the others.

The clientele is young -- a mix of NYU students, urban professionals and neighborhood lovers.   It's a good-natured and raucous crowd. On pleasant days the pandemonium spills out onto the sidewalk.  

The food is hot and cheap and tasty.  The menu is divided into three categories: Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian.  The purist in me wants to order from a single column (Thai everything perhaps?) but the closet anarchist in me wins and I order a haphazard sampling from every column.  It comes out quickly.  Beer is cheap and served cold.  

After a meal that includes nasi lemak and papaya salad and potstickers in peanut sauce, I push back from the table.  I am content.  

Peter, who has been energetically working the room to make sure all is well, appears at my table side to be sure I'm okay.  I ask a question about the peanut sauce, and as he explains, an iPhone materializes from his pocket.  He shows me the recipe.

""I do most of the cooking,"" he explains.  I'm not surprised.  His enthusiasm knows no bounds.  

""You should make a cookbook,"" I finally suggest.  For the first time in the evening, he pauses, giving it some thought.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Always heard great things about this hidden gem of a restaurant! Finally got to pay a visit!

Roti Canai Planta - it was lovely! Loved the green Thai curry! Not too spicy! The fried naan with the curry is a must try!

Thai style papaya salad - again, a must eat at this restaurant. I'm a fan of the papaya Thai salad. Have had it at many restaurants and claim this as one of the best in NYC! The crunchy peanuts with the well shredded fresh papaya and the perfect amount of lemon dressing keeps you craving for more!

Vegetable dumpling - Was good but have certainly had better!

Vegetarian curry clay pot - the curry was nice with fresh herbs and vegetables. The quantity of rice is a little less

Drunken noodle - can you go to a Thai restaurant and not order one? Of course not! flat noodles but found them slightly more oily than what I would prefer

Mee goreng - I thought this dish is Indonesian and when I saw this at Love Mama, I was so excited to eat!the thin nice noodles with fried veggies is high on calorie. Fresh garlic and chilies makes it spicy. Another must have at this restaurant.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I came in here with great expectations with my boyfriend unfortunately we were not overwhelmed by the food, the service or the very squished conditions. Unfortunately the food was lukewarm at best. The only thing that came out hot and fresh was the roti which was excellent!  The spring rolls is also very good  and hot.
It's a very reasonable place to eat but everything was thrown at us at once no pacing involved with the food.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"We had a feast after walking over 3 miles to get here. Everything on the menu was hella good. Definitely order the Uncle Plump's dumplings, the Thai chicken wings, pho Dac Biet and the roti!

Good customer service, staff were super friendly.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I actually think they're more like 4 but bumping up to 4.5 for the funny and hardworking owner! I recommend the Viet flank steak and Malaysian nasi lemak dishes~ they're pretty tasty and the flavor is nicely strong and seems authentic enough to me-- the only thing is the portion is a bit small for the price. The place is surprisingly roomy so good for large groups, and it's not so busy that it would be hard to get a table -- the place was half empty on Sunday night. The place is definitely casual and I do think they could improve their decor and go a little more upscale. For example switch to a nice menu instead of the plastic or get nicer tables and uniform. It's a mom and pop shop! The owner is very hardworking and our table enjoyed joking with him about Asian politics and his business. Hope it continues to do well.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"One of the best local spots in the East Village. My friend and I stumbled upon this place in the dead of winter because we were looking for some warmth. Walked into LoveMama and ordered one of everything on the menu.

You don't feel like you're in the East Village at all. Order everything.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"LoveMama was such a refreshing discovery near the east village. Ever since my trip from Malaysia, I have been curry obsessed and seeking the same flavor I experienced back in Kuala Lumpur. But it's hard to find a good vegetarian Roti Canai and am still looking for it. However, Lovemama came pretty close, they offer Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian cuisines all under one roof! the inside is cute kind of built like a shack I had clay curry pot full of veggies and fried tofu and roti canai which comes with a buttery sauce. I didn't care for the veggies much but the curry was really tasty kind of wish they served that with the roti instead of the gross thick buttery sauce it usually comes with. They had plenty of options for beverages, I inquired them about whether they were dairy-free or not and they said that it comes from a can. I appreciate their honesty but it wasn't appealing for me so I opted for refreshing coconut water. My friends ordered chicken satay and bao, which they liked.

Overall, definitely come check this lovely place out and do order roti with your curry dish and order some lovely fresh coconut water, cheers!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Everything I hoped it would be. I ordered a lunch special Vegetable Kra Pao that was garlicky, spicy, with perfectly cooked vegetables and fragrant basil. The side of dumplings were soft, delicious and comforting. This place is legit.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I went to LoveMama for an office lunch and it is a pretty good place.  It is very casual, relaxed, and good value.

I ordered a lunch special consisting of Rendang Nasi Lemak and Thai dumplings for $10.00.  The special comes with two dumplings and they have a lot of filling and are quite tasty.

The Rendang Nasi Lemak is a moderately spicy rice dish with chicken in a spicy sauce, egg, and some vegetables.  It had a unique and delicious flavor.  There were some inedible leaves used for seasoning and whatnot that I accidentally bit into, but other than that, the food was very good.

My colleagues ordered various other things, including pad thai, calamari, Thai chicken wings, and crab rangoon.  We all tried a bit of everything.  I really enjoyed the food.  It is spicy and I love spicy.  Even the pad thai was spicy compared to pad thai you get at other restaurants.  And the calamari was coated in a pretty spicy sauce as well.  I don't think my coworkers enjoyed the food as much because they didn't expect the spiciness and are not as good with spicy food.

LoveMama is great for lunch.  I wouldn't really recommend for a nice dinner as the restaurant is much too casual.  Definitely pay them a visit for good food and good value. Make sure you're ok with spicy food, or ask if they can make it mild.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"We loved the food here. We ordered Thai, Malaysian, and Indonesian food and were a little skeptical that they would all taste the same. But we were priced wrong. Each dish was unique and were bursting with flavor! Will go back again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I was very excited to have dinner here but I left the place pretty disappointed. The service itself is pretty okay. There was maybe two other tables of customers in there with us but for some reason it was impossible to get the server's attention.

The food wasn't bad but it also wasn't the best. You can find better Thai food in the city. Maybe it's because it's a mix of Thai/Malaysian food? I don't really know. But definitely have had better Thai food before. The reviews made it seem as if the food here is something to die for. It's nothing incredible for me.

I visited this place a month or so back and I can officially say I don't think I'll be coming back here.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Been waiting to come here for awhile now, finally took the time and ate here, and it was great!
tasted just like home cooking, perfect flavoring, deep and rich, goes really well with rice.  we stuck to the Malaysian menu cause its quite difficult to find good Malaysian food in the city
will 100% come back again! my gf was so impressed that she wants to take her office here lol",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Very crowded but service was efficient.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

dumplings were deliiiiiiiicious--think generously stuffed wonton with a touch of peanut sauce and chili oil, and they were very filling. My laksa was okay and very decent for a cold winter night. And the coconut juice came served in an actual coconut, so it wasn't oversweet at all.

The staff were so friendly and kept a smile on their face even though they were sooo busy,
My husband and i ordered the spring rolls, the flank steak cubes and the thai fried rice. If you like spicy the spring roll sauce is soooo  good! The flank steak was really flavorful and juicy and the rice was pillowy soft.

Appetizer: Roti Canai Planta
I love this dish from the Malay cuisine. It was pretty good but not the best Ive had.
The dipping sauce was delicious.

Entree: Rendang Nasi Lemak
One of their signature dishes. Its coconut pandanus jasmine rice with rendang curry.
Rendang flavor is of Indonesian origin. Traditionally prepared by the Minangkbau people. Its a coconut based curry with ginger, galangal leaves, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, chillies.
I was pretty impressed by the flovor blend",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"WARNING: This place has a high rating because they give you a free drink if you give a 5 star review. I mean the free drink is pretty sweet, but I'll give my review without taking that into consideration.

I tried the rendang nasi lemak and the mee goreng. The rendang nasi lemak was very flavorful. The beef has a strong curry flavor and a little kick to it. The pickled veggies gave a nice contrast to it to brighten up the dish. The coconut rice seemed a little dry, but I liked the flavor. The problem with this dish is how heavy it felt. The plate had a layer of oil on the bottom and a bunch of it soaked into the rice and peanuts. The mee goreng was also very flavorful. The combination of sweet and savory flavors was enjoyable. I also liked the chewyness of the noodles. The dish can feel repetitive by the end of it though. I also had the thai tea, which was refreshing, but very average (it tastes exactly like you'd expect).

Overall the food is pretty good. The interior of the restaurant isn't the nicest, but the service was surprisingly good.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I decided to try this restaurant as it offered Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian dishes. Due to yelp reviews, I did not have high expectations regarding the décor which was ok.  However, given that it amassed high rating, I expected the food to be super delish. My friends and I were disappointed.

We shared the following:

Roti Canai Planta - the roti was burnt and the dipping sauce was too thick.
Crab Rangoon - good enough.
Laksa with seafood - so so.
Pad thai with shrimps - the noodles had a burnt taste (maybe the wok was charred?).
Bo Luc Lac - so so.

The service was also disorganized.  The main dishes came before the appetizers and considering that the place was half empty, it took forever to receive our bill.

I will not be back.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Being in college, I can't enjoy the Malaysian curry my grandma makes since home is so far away. I alternate between the Mixed Seafood Curry Laksa and their Rendang and find myself coming back for both dishes. Their Roti is served hot and is extremely comforting for the stomach.

I ordered the Grilled Chicken Vermicelli Noodle bowl from the vietnamese section. taste-wise not bad and decent portion. but wasn't spectacular. maybe it would have been better if i went with the Malaysian section.
price is affordable. i don't mind giving this place another try but to be honest at the moment i haven't quite understand the other raves and hyped reviews, although it's not a negative experience anyway.. I'd say i'm just neutral with this place, definitely Not hating it, but not sure i'm  loving it",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

LoveMama,"(Order placed on Seamless)

Really good roti canai that was flavorful on its own, even without the dipping sauce, and had a nice texture! Unfortunately, my mango bubble tea was not great; the milk was strange, and it tasted weirdly artificial. The tapioca pearls were on the harder side, but this could have been due to the fact that the drink had been in transit for a little bit. The drink's taste was strange to the point that I actually didn't finish the tea, partly due to being full from other food, but I'm not sure that's ever happened before :/",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Sometimes it's cool to be a jack of all trades and master of none but maybe if you're a cheesecake factory or something. But if I'm feeling a rustic dish, I wanna see some mastery.

This place doesn't just serve 2 types of ethnic cuisines, but 3! It just isn't feasible to command mastery of all 3. It's like if someone played in the NBA, NFL, and MLB. It just ain't realistic.

So we started off with some roti which was flaky and nice, but it's a common dish so my expectations were met. The Pad Thai was a bit mushy and had a brownish tint to it. It honestly didn't have that noodle texture.

The fried rice was just generic fried rice. For something called coconut turmeric fried rice, I  was expecting a symphony of flavors in my mouth.

Overall it's just an average restaurant. I've been to much better restaurants that specialize in their respective cuisines.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

LoveMama,"Simply put: delicious.

Stunned by their 3.7k reviews and solid 4 star rating, we knew we had to give it a go. LoveMama is an unassuming family owned restaurant that serves a variety of SEA cuisines (Malaysian, Vietnamese, Thai). The menu may be small (everything is listed on a single laminated sheet), but the flavors aren't. They're homey and authentic, similar to what you would find in Chinatown.

Service - 5/5
Food - 5/5
Price - 4/5

Service is spectacular. The owners are so friendly and make all efforts to connect with their patrons. I feel like a regular even though it was my first time there.

Food is tasty and filling. Portions are fair. You'll be able to finish your dish with room for dessert. I recommend the Curry Laksa, Pad See Ew, Thai Iced Tea.

Prices are consistent with the St. Marks/Union square area. Dishes are about $13 average, which is pricier than similar restaurants in the Chinatown area but not unreasonable.

Minimal wait time but I was there at 6:30 on a Monday night. If you're worried, you can make reservations online.

Overall, if you're in the area, give it a try!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

The owner is a very sweet person and was a pleasure to talk to. He would even stop by tables and greet them which was so wonderful. The stars are for the service.

The loss of stars is because some of the food was not very appetizing. Pad see ew and Thai curry was good. The shrimp summer rolls were very plain with just shrimp and noodles. The sauce was not much better. Pad Thai definitely was overly sauced and didn't taste right. It was a pleasure to meet the owner, but I don't think I will be returning for the food.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Sat outside on a warm summer's night and spoke with the owner and was waited on by his son.  He makes all the sauces from scratch and this restaurant is his love.

We ordered Uncle Plumps Dumpling (my favorite dish of the night!) It's a overly stuffed pork and chive dumpling dosed in peanut and chili oil. So Amazing. I wanted more.

My boyfriend ordered the Rendang Nasi Lemak and I ordered the Seafood Laska noodle soup. I thought both dishes were good but didn't wow me over like Uncle Plumps Dumpling.

We ordered Nasi Lamak and Mee Goreng between the two of us. The portion was just right for two people.
The Mee Goreng has a slight burnt taste from the stir-fry. It was also a tad bit too salty for my liking.
The Nasi Lamak on the other hand was very well balanced. The coconut rice was creamy and flagrant. It paired well with the chicken stew.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

I got the nasi lemak, which was very flavorful and mildly spicy. I can't judge how authentic it was because it was my first time trying that dish. My only complaint was that it was a little too oily. The serving sizes are pretty large and the menu is very diverse, offering dishes from Malaysian, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisines.
Would definitely come back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,Service was absolutely horrible. We weren't served at all and had to hunt down the waitress. Our drinks were brought after our food and people that came after us have eaten and left before we even got our meal. We were completely ignored the entire night and it was a very unenjoyable experience. It also took forever to get the check. We had to ask multiple times. The food was nothing special at all. I've had way better Thai food in so many other places with good service and a nicer atmosphere. Thai Iced tea was very watered down as well.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Based on other reviews, I had high hopes for LoveMama.

The charsiu pork bun was extraordinary and unique.  Instead of using the usual Japanese style thick cut of pork, they use to thin Vietnamese marinated grilled pork chop meat and sriracha sauce.  Genius.

Unfortunately, everything else was terrible.  The spring roll tasted about as good as Costco frozen spring roll.  

Roti Canai was greasy and tasted of smelly old cooking oil.

Uncle plump dumpling was drenched with barely edible, far too sweet peanut-tasting sauce.  I am not allergic to nuts but this dish was bad enough to turn me allergic.

Beef pad thai was the most excessively sweet pad thai I have ever had. And I have had some pretty terrible pad thais before.  The only edible parts were the beef and the bean sprouts.

If you want a unique pork bun, this is a good place.  For other items, look elsewhere.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Our appetizer and main dishes ended up arriving at the same time, which was a little disappointing given we had ordered an app because we were very hungry upon arrival.

Place was full with a young crowd on a Thursday night and all the dishes that came out looked delicious. One of our friends was late and the servers were pretty nice about it.

Roti (4/5) - soft and fluffy, with substance. I don't like roti that is too airy so this was perfect. Took off 1 star because of the portion size

Thai iced tea (5/5) - good balance of tea and condensed milk

Nasi lemak (5/5) - spice level was on point, and I was actually feeling the heat. The chicken was tender and rice was soft with the perfect amount of sauce

Other dishes ordered at my party of 4 included cashew chilies, pad see ew, and pad kee maow all looked good.

The owner came over at the end of the meal to check in on us. Asked if we enjoyed the food and gave me a thumbs up for finishing the food lol. Super nice and friendly guy!

Overall 4/5 - Took off 1 Star for the food not coming out at the same time for the table and waters were not refilled. High recommend as a great casual spot to grab dinner with friends. Family owned and local eats are the best.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"The pad Thai was the best of Thai I've ever had. Do note that the place is more of an Asian fusion rather than something authentic. They serve Chinese, Vietnamese, and Malaysian food. But, it seems like they have mixed the three cuisines together into some sort of fusion. The pad Thai was very flavorful and delicious. The roti was not as thin as I've gotten at other places and the curry was not as good as well, so I wouldn't really recommend it. The Lemak was extremely good and would highly recommend.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,One of the best pad thai i had! Thai iced tea is a must! Just the right amount of spice! Very nice service as well! This is a low key good spot to eat!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"The place is not very big but it's a good size for a nice good meal. It can get packed quickly as there are not a lot of good southeast Asian food in the area. The chicken laksa was good and they weren't stingy with the chili paste. Some good appetizers were the roti canai, mussels, and Uncle Plump's dumplings which is served in a peanut sauce mix. The spices and flavors in every dish were well executed. Even though the dishes we ordered were delicious, I think I would've appreciate it more if I can differentiate the flavors in the Thai, Viet and Malay dishes. All done well but it might worth a try to focus on one of the three cuisines, maybe Malaysian since there aren't much Malaysian around and more room to make the dishes stand out.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Why is this rated so highly?  So disappointing.

Only American tourists would rate this so high.  No way local New Yorkers would go to this place with all the other choices around.

Instead of doing one cuisine well, they do many really crappy.

Flavors are super diluted, and our wontons were soggy.  Why would you serve overcooked wontons that have been sitting out all day?",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"***Good portions, Quick service, Decent food***

There's an assortment of Asian cuisines you can try here, but it's not authentic. I'd recommend here if you want a quick bite/service. Otherwise, there are lots of other options throughout the city that you'll have a better experience.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Really good Pad Thai! It has a smokey flavor to it, which makes it taste even better.

Spring rolls were your typical generic ones though.

Ambiance is pretty loud and relatively packed.

Solid Thai place.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Food: 2/5
Not sure if it's because I stopped by for lunch but I left very unimpressed with the food quality. They have a small lunch menu for $10. I ordered the dumpling and the ka prao with chicken. My friend ordered the spring roll and pad thai. The appetizers are not impressive and the entree is just par. I've had better lunch specials elsewhere. The entrees were pretty spicy and bland at the same time. I felt very parched after my meal.

Service: 3/5
Just par, nothing special. One of the employees requested I post a good Yelp review.

Ambiance: 3/5
Again, nothing special.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I ordered delivery- the drunken noodles. I have had it before but the quantity of the noodles was half of what it usually is. Though it came on time, the delivery person was extremely rude as well. Very disappointing to order from here, won't recommend for delivery. Have been ordering from other places regularly, for a 13$ price, this wasn't worth it.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,Solid place in the EV especially if you're doing a lunch special. It's ten bucks for a lot of food app plus meal. I liked the service there plus the food was not expensive and tasty! Alford then have the best decor but certainly good for a chill night out,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"This spot has SO many great reviews and I don't totally get it. I ordered pad see ew, as that's one of the simpler dishes I think most restaurants do well. The delivery was fast, but half my noodles were stuck together, and had no sauce. So most was okay, but a solid quarter were white unseasoned noodles. Who knows, maybe they had a busy delivery night, and if I was there in person, I would have sent it back to be remade (and I'm sure more care would be taken). But since this was takeout....and I had no option...I'm left disappointed, and not really wanting to make the effort to try LoveMama in person.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Overall: 4; Food: 4; Service: 3.5; Atmosphere: 3.5

Food: 4
The menu was pretty extensive, covering Malaysian, Thai and Vietnamese food. Anytime there's a long menu covering different types of cuisines, I'm a little wary, but the food here was super solid. Pho was great, with big portions and the Thai basil stir fry were really good. It's one of the better Thai basil stir fries I have in a while, with a homey authentic flavor.

Service: 3.5
Not amazing, but in line with expectations for the type of restaurant.

Atmosphere: 3.5
Super casual. On a hot day, no AC, which was tough, but totally fine otherwise.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I definitely agree with some of the other reviews for LoveMama. I found this place to be a solid 2.5 at best, and was initially excited to come here based on the high ratings. I was putting off my review because I wanted to give this place another chance, but after coming here twice, it has consistently disappointed me. I found the quality of the food and the ratings didn't quite match up, and am now very skeptical about the reviews for this restaurant. The food itself was okay. The dishes lacked flavor, or I would find some items to be overly greasy or even tasted burnt. The two different groups of friends I dined here with on the two separate occasions didn't enjoy their meals either, so it wasn't just me. My 2 stars are based on the service because at least that was good.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Really unique dining experience here! It's a casual sit-down spot with Malaysian/Viet/Thai options. Guess if you're craving south East Asian - this is a safe choice!
We ordered Thai chicken wings, roti canai, shrimp dumplings, and a string bean/beef Malaysian entree (sooo bad with remembering names of less familiar dishes). Everything was a good portion size for the price and very delicious!!
Service was good and given we ordered several drinks and food, the bill made me do a happy dance (for NYC standards- won't break your wallet).
I can see myself coming back here if I'm in the area",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Absolutely delicious. My big party and I were seated immediately in a busy weeknight and we got the following orders:

MEE GORENG
ROTI CANAI
PAD SEE EEW
VEGETARIAN CURRY CLAY PLOT

Everything was savory, tastefully presented and easy to share. I'd definitely come back if I'm in town again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Heard lots of good things about this place, so I decided to try it. As you can tell from the 3 stars, I didn't think it was anything special. It wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about either.

I got the vegetable clay pot (a dish, as a Malaysian, that I've made myself), while my friends got the beef rendang and Mee goreng (dishes my mom made). All Malaysian dishes. The food was alright, it lacked some substance, and the spices didn't come together in any particularly cohesive manner. I'm not sure if the owners are Southeast Asian themselves, but the food didn't seem to be very inspired or refined. To be honest, it felt like the kind of dish made from a recipe book.

The setting was nice, very honest - you could tell the place has been around longer than many of the other places in the area. The service was lacking - our server seemed annoyed by my questions, and we had to call her over to get water refilled or to get the bill. However, I've come to expect that from family run Asian restaurants, and I care more about the food than the service.

I'll be frank here - I think part of the reason for this place's popularity is due to its location and audience. Southeast Asian fusion mom & pop shops are a dime a dozen in Queens, especially in Elmhurst or Flushing, and many of them have better food than this place. But I can see how, in East Village, this seems unique, and has a refreshing, honest presence amongst all the newer and more polished restaurants in the area.

All in all, it's a cute place, and might seem exotic to some, but the food doesn't seem all that great. I wouldn't come here regularly.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Stopped by here for a very late lunch prior to a job interview and was extremely glad I chose this place. Their cuisine is clearly delineated into three columns: Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian from left to right, which seems to be how common they are in New York in descending order. I wanted something different, not pho or drunken noodles or Thai red curry so three guesses which cuisine I chose.

I chose Mee Goreng, which I don't believe I ever had the pleasure of sampling before, and the Malay Spring rolls, which I only got one of and it did not come with the mentioned chili dipping sauce. It was your standard deep-fried cylinder of shredded vegetables; nothing else worth mentioning.

The Mee Goreng, on the other hand, was a huge bowl of stir fried egg noodles with your choice of chicken or vegetables (I chose chicken), beansprouts, egg, shredded lettuce, peanuts, and fresh lime. Not mentioned on the menu, there were also chunks of tomatoes in here. Thoroughly loved it; very filling, did not skimp on the chicken, I'd say two eggs in there total, and decently heavy on the lime. It was somewhat spicy to my palate; not lacking in kick, but not making me sweat, either.

I definitely will be swinging by here in the future to avail myself of the other lunch specials.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"The food was really delicious. My friend and I ordered their popular dishes: Rendang Nasi Lemak- a Malaysian dish(quite spicy!:), Roti Canai Planta, grilled chicken vermicelli noodle. The prices are the lowest I have seen. The only part I did not like is that the tables were so close to each other, and it was loud as well.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Cute, authentic Southeast Asian restaurant that gets really busy during dinner time. The service staff and bustling atmosphere really makes you feel at home!

Even though the place was absolutely full when my friends and I came, out orders came really quickly and the food was delicious~

Definitely worth it! Though there are lots of NYU students for some reason",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Even though the place mixes three cuisines -- Thai, Malaysian, and Vietnamese -- I think they do a great job with all three. I can't say it is the best Thai I have ever had, but it is the best bang for your buck. All of the food is relatively cheap! Furthermore, it has options for everyone. I went with two vegetarian friends and two meat lovers and everyone left satisfied.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant itself is nothing to brag about. It is quite simple, without many decorations or nice tables. However, I think that just adds to the experience. It makes it seem more like a family diner with a homey feeling.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

LoveMama,"Tonight was my third time eating here and not sure if things changed or I never noticed but the service was quite.. cold. Don't expect stellar service. Come here for the local cuisine, nothing fancy no frills.

So we ordered the Thai chicken wings, Thai crunchy spring rolls, chicken pad kee Mao (drunken noodle) and the waiter recommended a Vietnamese chicken glass noodle dish. Two minutes after we ordered, we decided we wanted chicken satay instead of the chicken wings. They told us we couldn't change bc they started cooking already. Ok. Sure.. No problem.

A few minutes later we get the pad kee mao which was excellent as always. My friend's Vietnamese noodles were alright but I would not order again. Next the chicken wings came 10-15 minutes later. Nothing special. The sauce was good but the chicken was eh. I really wished they let us cancel the order. Then we ask what happened to the spring rolls? And another 15 minutes later they came out. Which were great.

Interesting timing of our order coming out. All in all I think there are better Thai places in the city. Not sure I will be back.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Would just say that the overall yelp rating for LoveMama is not representative of the quality of the food or experience you actually get.

Ordered coconut water and got an actual coconut, which I did not expect so that's coollll

The food was very reasonably priced,and the owner comes around chit chatting with each table, which was so nice.

The service is friendly but efficient - I wouldn't recommend the place if you're looking lounge and slowly enjoy your meal but would 100% recommend if you're looking for a fun, delicious and affordable meal or night out!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

LoveMama,"AMAZING MALAY FOOD!!!!
Love Mama serves thai, vietnamese, and malaysian food, and I urge you to try malaysian, because it is actually made by malaysians.

Food:
Roti prata: Just perfect, crispy and flaky yet chewy. I really wished I could take them home. Perfect appetizer, loved the curry sauce to dip
Seafood laksa: More like curry than laksa, but still was really good! Not as thick as laksa but still has the elements of it
Rendang Nasi Lemak: This was my ultimate favorite food when I went to Singapore, so my expectation was high. and it did not disappoint. They had great fragrant coconut rice and yummy sambal, and the beef was very very good (but also really spicy)!!

My friends tried Mee goreng as well and they really loved it.

As a group of four, we ordered two appetizer and one entree each, which came to $64. You can't beat this!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I understand this is a fusion place, but if you are going to offer thai food, please go to google and look up the recipe for how to make the food. We ordered just a few plates to try since we are in new york and we love asian food. Since Lovemama was advertised everywhere and the ratings were good, we were going to give it a try. The place is small and cute and busy so it should be awesome.

So how can one mess up papaya salad?? Never tasted a papaya salad like that . I think they forgot all the ingredients.... where is the garlic, sugar, fish sauce, lime juice etc. it was really the worse we've ever had. I did ask the waiter for the sauce so we could mix it ourselves but he said that's how it comes. Also we ordered 4/5 spicy and it came out 0.5/5 spicy.  The guy was nice enough to remove it from out check.

The desert... coconut sticky rice with mango... Ive never had a bad one until now. How can one really mess this up??!! Instead of using ripe LONG mangos they used sour green unripe KENT mango.... ugg  the sticky rice and coconut was fine but it wasn't enjoyable without the ripe long mango.... i think they need to refer back to google recipes.

The pad see ew was just ok. Not the best or the worst, a 3 out of 5 rating. The pancake with curry is good.

We were really disappointed on our first night in New York.  If you want real thai food, go to a real thai restaurant",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Didn't hate it. Didn't love it. Not worth the hype though.

The Good - Their roti canai was DELICIOUS. Buttery, flaky, yumm-ness! The pad kee Mao was also decent. Catered to vegetarians well. They may work off mostly reservations as this place is rather tiny and gets very busy.

The Bad - Didn't feel the Malay food was that great. Got the clay pot and a rice dish. Both were okay but nothing I'd recommend or come back for. Tiny cramped seating.

The Ugly - had a reservation for 6 pm on a Friday. Friends were running late so called to move to 6:30 pm. Owner said no as they had a full house that night. My friend called them 10 mins after I did and asked for a reservation at 7, and they said yes! Huge turn off. Maybe that's how places work here but doesn't sit well with me.

Tips - make a reservation. Call, don't do it online as they don't list the evening times available. They only have 1 bathroom for the restaurant. Not sure if this was on all sides of the walls but we thankfully got seated in a corner and I happened to find an outlet and was able to charge my phone.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Food is amazing. Wanted to try everything. Couldn't stop ordering. Had a party of 6. The Pad Thai was so good that I ordered two. Uncle Dumplings my party had to order to more. Thai Ice Tea is always good at places like this. Typically I'd go to Flushing for asian food but its so good knowing that this spot is right where I work.

Definitely ask for a to go menu because the food here is so good and so well priced that you'll be coming for lunch all the time.

The only downside I had it that it took way too long to get service. When I sat down I waited about 10 minutes by myself. A couple got sat down and got service quicker, made me feel ignored. Really annoyed me, but I was waiting for my party anyway. Just make sure to shout  service if they take too long, food is definitely worth the wait.

**They do bribe you to do a Yelp Review after your done eating. Didn't bother me, I know if they didnt I wouldnt have wrote this. Server was polite about it.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

LoveMama,It's pretty average SE fare and the lunch portions are tiny. The pad kee mao was just okay - it wasn't spicy at all the container was maybe half-filled. The chicken was also non-existent. Maybe dinner is better but lunch is a huge miss. The ambiance is also lacking as well as the servers were using the tables to prepare vegetables.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"After dining here, it baffles my mind that there are so many reviews of high praise for LoveMama.

I thought I'd give it a shot after reading all of the great reviews the restaurant had. Plus, there are over 3300 reviews, so there must be something good about it if so many people are coming here, right? I came here for a Friday evening dinner with a group of friends at about 6:30pm. The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived, however it got pretty crowded at 7-7:30pm.

The restaurant menu consists of 3 different cuisines - Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian, which in retrospect was a red flag because restaurants that serve multiple cuisines typically aren't great. Since we were a table of 6, we decided to order a bunch of dishes to share family-style.  

Cold Noodles (with Peanut Sesame Sauce) - OK, but had much more potential. For typical peanut sauce noodles, lo mein is not used, so that made us scratch our heads a bit.

Uncle Plump's Dumplings - Really good and probably one of the better dishes we ordered. There were 6 pieces in the order and I loved the peanut sauce for the dumplings.

BBQ Char Sui Buns - Absolute disappointment. The BBQ pork was some of the worst I've ever had. This definitely goes on the 'do not order' list.

Roti Canai Planta - OK. Not great, but not bad either. It is what it is, roti canai.

Thai Fried Chicken Wings - Very tasty and flavorful. The wings were basted very well.

Pad See Eew - Surprisingly decent and one of the few dishes our table finished up.

Thai Fried Rice - Not bad.

Sambal String Beans - On the spicy side for some of my tablemates, but I thought it had just the right kick to it.

Rendang Nasi Lemak - Our table didn't try much of this, but the meat was pretty tender and tasty.

Grilled Chicken Vermicelli Noodle - I thought this was done pretty close to how it is cooked at Viet restaurants so props to them for making the vermicelli correctly.

Thai Iced Tea - Watered down and not good at all. One of the worst Thai Iced Teas I ever had.

Overall, most of the food was OK. There wasn't any one stand out dish that made me go ""I need to come back"". It might be better if they focus on 1 cuisine, but maybe that's the appeal to most that they offer 3 different ones and people are fine with average flavors. Either way, if I'm in search of any one of the cuisines they serve, I'll be going to a restaurant that specializes in it.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"My friend selected LoveMama for our monthly dinner outing.  We walked in and found the restaurant to be casual and comfortable.

We chose Thai iced tea to drink and surveyed the well laid out menu.  The menu is equal parts Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian.  I've had a decent amount of Thai and Vietnamese food but was new to Malaysian.  I was tempted to focus on the Malaysian selections but your eye is consistently drawn across the menu to Thailand and Vietnam as well.

We began with Roti Cani Planta (a pancake style dish with lentil dip), BBQ Char Siu Bun, Uncle Plumps Dumplings (yes it's fun to say), and Malaysian Chicken Satay.  With the 4500 or so 4.5 star Yelp reviews, we had really high expectations.  Once we had the first bite of our appetizers, we knew that our expectations would be exceeded.  Each item was executed in a crisp and clean fashion and popped with flavor, they were all near the best I've had.

We moved on to the Papaya Salad, Char Kaa Teow, and Rednang Lasi Nemak.  The papaya salad texture was just right, a barely yielding al dente coated in a sweet and spicy dressing with texture from the peanuts.  The Rednang Lasi Nemak called to me as soon as I looked at the menu and it delivered in a big way.  Tender meat with a zesty curry sauce.  The Char Kney Teow was perhaps the surprise dish of the evening, it is billed simply on the menu as stir fried egg and bean sprouts but it delivered multiple textures and a haunting sauce that kept me heading back for more.  There seemed to be flat noodles in it as well and the array of texture was delightful.

Two people may have stopped eating at an earlier point but we pressed on, with the fear of missing out overruling any nutritional common sense.  The Malaysian spring rolls were delivered smoking hot and super crisp.  Rolled in a lettuce leaf with mint and dipped in a flavorful sauce, they were a great choice.  The wok seared beef salad was another revelation, well seasoned beef with crunchy onions and a delicate sauce were the perfect counterpoint to the rest of our dishes.

We chose to finish up with the Mango Sticky Rice dessert and it delivered the same level of flavors as the savory dishes.  Great coconut cream, perfectly ripe mango, and rich and sticky rice.

The staff was professional and the food was all delivered at optimal temperature in quick fashion.  The gentleman at the counter showed tremendous pride in the establishment.  He was also proud of the high ranking LoveMama has earned right here on Yelp.  With over 4500 fantastic reviews , I guess I'm signing off on one more love letter to LoveMama.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,I personally think the food is just okay. It is a little too salty for my taste. But the Thai milk tea that comes for free if you check-in on Yelp was great!,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I still do not understand why this place has so many reviews and that too good ones. It does not look particularly nice, nor is the ambiance great. It looks like a family run restaurant.

In fact, when we went in, it was really hot. Even the air conditioner was not working well. Like many reviewers mentioned here, the food came really quickly, which was super weird. Taste was average, nothing exceptional. I ordered the mango with sticky rice and that was average too.

The worst part was the server continuously kept making remarks that were totally uncalled for. We were a group of Indians, and he continuously kept calling us brothers and sisters and poking around, which no one really enjoyed! I am not going there again",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"I had the beef rendang plate and the Thai chicken wings. Yes, I'm greedy. Lol I ate it all. It was very delicious. I would definitely come again and I would recommend it.

So it's a pretty popular spot.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Not sure what the hype is all about. The Thai Iced Tea was good--not too sweet--which is the way I like it. For appetizers, my companion and I ordered the Uncle Pump's Dumplings and the Crab Rangoon. The Crab Rangoon was served first, and was made of wonton wrappers stuffed with cream cheese and onions. When asked about them containing crab, we were told that ""All Crab Rangoon in any restaurant only contains cheese and does not contain meat."" As far as my memory serves me, their menu at the restaurant did not state this. Next, the Dumplings came out and they were completely shredded to pieces and didn't resemble dumplings at all. The meat was exposed and the dumpling wrappers were flaked into pieces all over the plate.  

My meal was the Bo Luc Lac Flank Steak. Nothing to really praise about; the flavor was very garlic heavy and extremely salty. My companion ordered the Rendang Nasi Lemak, which I did not try, but according to hear was good but nothing to rave about.

Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes, but I made-up my mind to not go out of my way to come back after experience with the appetizers.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"LoveMama comes as close as you can get to authentic Malaysian in this area. Yes, it's not saying much. But at least their take on Malaysia's national dish, nasi lemak, is recognizable to the real thing.

Could you get LoveMama's nasi lemak on the streets of Kuala Lumpur or Johor Bahru? Probably not. The meat is tougher and it's missing the plethora of peanuts and dried anchovies. But, it still has the overall flavors and can evoke memories of a trip back to Malaysia.

The mee goreng is the same. It's got all the parts and most of the flavors. Don't judge it by how it looks - Malaysian isn't all about presentation. It's tasty flavors are part of an eat to feel full cuisine.

Roti was quite good though. Wished they gave more!

LoveMama offers Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian cuisine but stick with the Malaysian. The very friendly Malaysian Chinese owner even told us so...",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

LoveMama,"The reviews of LoveMama led me to try it out. I waited a while before the waiters even realized I was there, but once they did they were very friendly and made me a laugh a few times. As for the food, I ordered the grilled chicken dish which comes with a decent portion of jasmine rice. The chicken was tender but lacking lemongrass flavor. Adding sriracha, hoisin, and the vinegar sauce helped kick up the flavor. It was an affordable and filling meal. 1 meal and 2 waters was $17. I took 2 stars off because parking was hard to find and the place really could've been cleaner. It took me over 30 minutes to find a spot. There was some trash on the floor.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"Ordered from here on a Friday night. I loved their chicken satay, but the edamame could use some salt. The chicken fried rice was good, nothing special. Same goes for vegetable pad thai. The red curry was tasty. However a few minutes after eating the food, my stomach was giving me issues and had to go to the bathroom several times. Not sure which food  caused this reaction. Overall, if you're looking for Thai food to fill you up, this is the place to go.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"The staff was friendly and very helpful, the food was insanely rich and delicious, and they did not skimp on the spice levels.

The menu was very large, which is usually a red flag for me, but everything we ordered tasted fresh.

The menu has options from Thai, Malaysian and Vietnamese cuisine. We mostly stuck to the Malaysian options out of coincidence, but will be going back and trying things from all sections of the menu.

5/5. 10/10. /.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"We came here for an early Sunday dinner. They offer Thai, Malay, and Vietnamese cuisine, but we all decided to try Malay because it was a friend's first time. A friend and I split the roti, nasi lemak(w/ beef) and mee goreng (w/ chicken). All three were REALLY good. The roti had a crunchy exterior and soft interior. The nasi lemak has many different components that all provide different flavors to create a complex flavor profile. Mee goreng was also flavorful, and the sauce was delicious. The last two are very spicy tho, so beware. I definitely will come back.

Service: Very friendly! He gave all of us a free drink for coming.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

I liked the food !!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"food was just okay. ordered the pad kee mao and the nasi rendang. the beef rendang was good but the coconut rice was a little dry. the pad kee mao noodle pieces were broken into small pieces already and soggy, and overly darkened by soy sauce.
we asked for spicy pad kee mao and it actually had some kick!
Our food arrived pretty quickly. service was really nice and sweet. just the food won't have me coming back. the dumpling appetizers didn't look too appealing as they arrived to other peoples' tables; they seemed to be one of those things that were frozen and heated up before they were sent to your table.
very clear they're very successful for their takeout orders and table turnover inside is pretty quick so don't be scared if there's a wait.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"The pictures of the interior here on Yelp make this little restaurant look better that what it is in real life. The worn out furniture and and beat up paint give it a feel of being a bit dirty. The service is lacking. But what makes this place is the food. I am attaching pictures of everything that was ordered. All of the dishes were great! The fried calamari does not look like what you expect, it does not have a panko or bread crumb fried crust around it. I was taken aback when it arrived at our table, but could not stop eating afterwards. The thai dumplings were great, the roti delicious. I would make an order out place if I lived close, but it is not a place for a nice or romantic dinner.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

Will definitely be making my way back here soon!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants
LoveMama,"When you are in for some lip smacking asian (kinda greasy) this is the place.

I totally love their calamari its so darn flavorful - its all for the flavor. And mussels are my favorite too. I usually order a side of rice to have it with sauce with which mussels are served. Their Malaysian curries are great too. We have tried the vegetarian one.

We have tried other dishes on the menu as well but those 3 have been our favorites rest were Okay!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

The menu serves a variety of dishes across a couple Asian cuisine. Lots of noodle dishes!  I had Pad Kee Mao and my husband had the Panang curry. Both were flavorful and good. Service was fast as well.  Prices were very reasonable, $12-13 for our dishes.  Would definitely come back when in NY again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?osq=restaurants

The place is very clean - much more so than similar places in LA or San Francisco with options for everyone! There are many different food types including drinks those that cater to vegans and vegetarians and several bars. We were happy to pick up some cool IPAs we cannot get at home!

Time Out Market New York,"Sure, prices here might be $1-3 higher than you might expect elsewhere, but it comes with the territory: two levels full of dozens of carefully selected eateries.

The ground level has the main dining hall and is a very tight squeeze when crowded, but there's got to be something for everybody here, whether ramen, sandwiches, Mexican, seafood, burgers, toast, acai bowls, or dessert. There's a fair amount of seating at communal benches and, as you venture further inside, there's more to discover in all directions.

Don't miss a second level of eateries on the rooftop, which has a patio that offers panoramic views of the two bridges and the Manhattan skyline. The space here might be a tad less crowded and there's a more airy, light-filled ambience here.

Good food - and lots of it - roaring ambience, and great views - what's not to love?",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Ugghhhhhhh.......
The scenery is amazing, but the food wasn't as awesome as I was expecting! I also wish that the entire market took cash, and not select locations.

The live music is definitely a go to, and I would recommend it on a chill Friday night, but I'm very picky with food and if you are too I'd say really ask around for what you might prefer.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Creative food hall with a nice rooftop view. I ended up trying the blue sorbet at the ice cream place. Pretty tasty.

The place seems to be curated by hipster editors. There's a place that only sells avocado dishes. (Insert eye roll here.)

I ended up heading back to the city to Chinatown to get some cheap grub at Vanessa's Dumpling House, my ultimate NYC favorite.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Personally, I've never had the best luck with markets. It's always hit or miss.

In this particular case, I'd say it's one of the better options for market style meals. So far, I've tried:

-Wings from Mr. Taka
-udon beef soup and chicken karagge from Bessou
-ice cream from Ice and Vice
-chocolate espresso & cheese cake dome desserts plus coffee from Bread's Bakery
-mac n' cheese from Jacob's pickles

I'd say everything was good, the only thing exceptional was the beef udon soup. I didn't like the mac n' cheese at all from Jacob's pickles - it was basically pasta with cheese and it was't good.

If you're indecisive and need some options, this is a good place to browse. If you plan on heading here after 7pm, beware - some places have already closed by that time.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"This review is for the avocaderia at time out market.  Ps this market does NOT accept cash which is absurd for a tourist spot.

SOOO disappointing. Can't express enough what a rip off this place is. I got the standard avocado toast for $8 and it was literally just avocado on one toast with Chili flakes on top. Pretty sure they put some salt on it too because it was SO salty and my friend and I were thirsty for hours after.

I know it's my own fault to go out and pay for avocado toast but this was literally as basic as it gets. NOT WORTH IT, make it at home!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"The last time I was in this area about a year or so ago, this wasn't here. It's a nice looking refurbished/re-purposed/refinished building. It's on the Brooklyn side, near DUMBO/DUMBO Pier, at Brooklyn Bridge Park, in between the Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge.

After walking around most of the morning and losing track of time, we decided to stop here and grab a late lunch early dinner. There's a handful of retail shops here, lots of spots for photo ops to level up your IG game. Main attraction here is the food hall....aka food court. Go to their website to see all the vendors.

There's about over 20 different food vendors, it was tough to decide, we did multiple laps around the area and we still couldn't decide. We even parted our ways to just go get something and still couldn't decide. Everything looked good, but not really, do I want that, what mood am I in, that looks heavy, I want something hot, did I eat my vegetables today....I mean it was difficult for us. Fugg It.....pick something!!!!  

Most places are pretty hipster-fied so it may not be exactly what you think it is.

Here it is:

-Miso Glazed Salmon Bento from Bessou: It's not served in a bento box but in a bowl but the ingredients are all separated out, basically it's a deconstructed hipster bi bim bap. It was ok, not too much flavor but a lot of veggies that this body needed, pretty good sized bowl that we were able to share, about 7 or so different kinds of items in the bowl, salmon was nicely cooked but wished they went heavier on the glaze or the bowl came with some sauce because it was pretty dry/plain when you mix it all up.

8 Wings & Rice from Fish Creek Thai: Yea, we went to a fish spot to get wings, you know it. This dish was their daily special they were running that day so we went for it. The wings were pretty good, nicely fried up, the seasoning and spice mix on the wings were pretty darn good, crisp as can be, hot out the fryer, comes with a scoop of rice, we also were able to share this.

For dessert we went to ""Do""....pronounced dough. It's a cookie dough place, this was pretty good, forgot which flavors we got, chocolate and something else. The small 2 scoop was plenty, it looks like ice cream but it isn't. Its definitely very rich, thick and on the heavy side for a dessert. Not like the cookie dough I ate when I was a kid but this is definitely spun up to a fancier level with interesting flavors. May be worth trying.

Overall, it's an ok place to grab something to eat, prices are on the higher side, if you want to get a drink like water, juice, coke or something, the food vendors seem to not sell drinks but there is a bar on the backside to get your drinks, it took me a few minutes to figure out where to wet my whistle at. The cleaning staff there were all really good, real quick to clear your empty plates, but I still think you are supposed to bus your own area.  All shared community long tables, so move your stuff!

Comfy place to stop and grab a bite and cop a squat for a bit, not far from the subway, but the views outside are wonderful.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"So many options (both on the ground floor and on the rooftop).

The smoked salmon Jerusalem bagel (5/5) from Breads Bakery hits the spot. It's the best I've had outside of Israel tbh.

Not a huge fan of the seating layout in the market itself as it can be a bit dark and feel very crowded, so take it to go and head to the waterfront  .",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I was in Dumbo in Brooklyn last May and this market did not exist so they have come along way in a short amount of time.  This is such an amazing place to visit in Brooklyn.

Dumbo is impressive and beautifully done. It has a rustic old New York style and it feels and looks good.  The food options are endless. Come here for the food and the view on the 5th floor.

So many options, Juliana's (my favorite), Felice Pasta Bar (the place was packed),  Pat LaFrieda, David Burke, Breads Bakery, a vegan food place. On the weekends they have music on the top deck. Most of the places serve drinks.

This is really a great place to grab some amazing food,  visit with friends and family and enjoy the amazing scenic views of New York & Brooklyn.

If you have not been here yet, better hurry because the word is out and the tourists are coming.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Time Out Market New York,"At first, I was so excited to try this market and just walking around, there's so many great choices to pick from, that it feels fantastic. I was contemplating if I wanted Fish Cheeks (which has been on my list) or to go with Jacob's Pickles, which I always enjoy or Pat La Frieda etc. The sheer variety can be overwhelming for those who are indecisive but then again, it's always great to have strong options.

I went for David Burke Kitchen and got the ""Hipster Steak Frites"" (description: flatiron steak, shishitos, parmesan, blue cheese, chili oil)  for $24 (with tax). I was really disappointed though because it was actually basically a salad with a little sprinkle of fries and skirt steak on top as the garnish... I did not see any shishitos, parmesan, blue cheese, or chili oil. I was refunded easily, which I appreciated. They were very nice about it. I just think it was misleading overall. I mean, if it's a salad, they should just call it ""salad with skirt steak"".

Then, I decided to try Felice's Pasta bar. I had the tagliatelle con funghi porcini (mushroom, cream sauce, parmesan), which came to about $20 with tax. I liked it at first but then felt that the reliance on heavy cream, made the dish a little sickening. I felt sick to my stomach after eating it.

I think overall, the idea of the market is nice. However, I will say that I think people wanting to enjoy a ""market"" may want a lower price point- perhaps of $10-$15. I think for me, if I'm going to spend $20-$25, I would prefer the ambiance of a sit-down restaurant.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Alright so my review may be a slightly biased since I live in Chicago, and in comparison, I think the layout of the Chicago market is much easier to navigate, BUT that aside, Time Out Market NYC is totally cool! And home to some amazing NYC staples, all under one roof. Perfect spot for a tourist like me to get a bit of everything in one short trip.

My favorite by far was the tagliatelle from Felice. Noodles cooked perfectly al dente, covered in a creamy white sauce, loads of tender mushrooms, and covered in parmesan. Totally worth the 18$ for this one. Drinks here were also delicious! I love mezcal so I immediately gravitated toward the smoky mule, and it was amazing! Perfectly smoky, but still light and refreshing.  

We ventured up to the rooftop floor which is much more open and bright than the first floor, and the rooftop patio has a beautiful view of Manhattan. Would I come back? Probably not. But I'm glad we stopped here for an hour or so during our quick 48 hours in NYC.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

2 things that lured me here.. The views and food.

Time Out Market New York,"Great place to have dinner, listen to live music and take in the DUMBO scenery.
I can tell this is already going to become a tourist spot so go here while you can.
It gets extremely crowded on Saturday night so be warned and be ready to practice patience. Let me see if I can paint a better picture for you...
The place is heavily secured so it feels safe and organized despite the visible chaos. One issue is, good luck trying to get some water from the bar! Thankfully it was easier to get water downstairs but the upstairs did not have any self serve water area. The other challenge was trying to find a place to sit. Since there were 3 of us we figured it wouldn't be difficult but it still proved that we had to lap around multiple times. Another issue is if you want something upstairs you cannot take it downstairs, and vice versa. I recommend you plan it out so you can maximize your time here.

Now onto our favorite topic: food.
Upstairs: Juliana's classic margherita was delicious and thin crusted. Projected time was 30 mins which gave us time to stand in line for the bathroom and scope out the place. Actual time was probably less than that.

Downstairs: soo many more options. We wanted to get fish cheeks since I love fish cheeks but they ran out of most of their entrees, so no luck.
We got instead...

Bessou: snacks (salmon with crispy rice whitefish with crispy rice) is true to its name. It is just a small bite or two. It was an experience but would not get again considering the portion.
The chicken karaage was good though - crunchy but tender inside.

Jacob's pickles:
Fried pickles. It still tastes the way I remember, pickled yet sweet, crispy and fried yet light...so good.
Mac and cheese- delicious and with penne. Y'all fancy.

Alta calidad:
Tacos - my friends had them but it looked good. The shrimp looked large
Roti pizza - essentially a crispy roti with beans and cheese on top. Kind of salty and too heavy for me.

I hope to come back to try other spot to see if they do their original flagships justice.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I may have come on an off-time, but on a weekday in the evening this area was pretty DEAD for New York.  There is probably an exodus after work hours.

Having been to the Lisbon Time Out, this location is not as open and didn't prompt me to want to eat anything.  It's quite dim, so the ceilings seem low, and all the signs have the same aesthetic.  It just made me look at the stalls...from a distance.

Perhaps a livelier atmosphere would give me a different impression.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"TimeOut Market is such a joy to walk through with so many food options my eyes darted from place to place like a tennis match.

The layout is nice and long with plenty of seating too and although crowded to me it wasn't overwhelming for a food hall.

Time Out Market New York,"I love the DUMBO area of Brooklyn, to have this beautiful market here now makes it all the more fantabulous.

There's a big difference between The Time Out Market New York and Deklab Market is the vendors have more room, the patrons have more room plus a roof deck overlooking the water. Have I mentioned Clinton St Bakery Pancakes all day long?? This is now the best market on Planet Earth.

There are lots of vendors vying for your dining choice: Felice Pasta Bar, Jacob's pickles, Breads bakery, Juliana's, Pat LaFrieda, David Burke, the list goes on and on. I was about to order Japanese Fried Chicken but we saw these crazy bagels from Montreal so we decided one of the huge bagels topped scrambled eggs and salmon. The sandwich was insane, soooooo flavorful.

This market doesn't have the retail outlets like Chelsea Market but what it offers are some crazy restaurants. Pretty much the best of New York dining all under one roof. From full service bars to restaurants with actual tables, The Time Out Market New York should be visited.

PS - The surrounding stores outside are an added bonus",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I really wanted to give this marketplace / food court of sorts a 4 star review, but my experience of the actual vendor I went to was truly disappointing. I went to Pat LaFrieda for the sliders on the menu. I ordered ahead of my three friends and they all received their food before I did. I waited 15 minutes, then 20, then 30, then 35. At the 30 minute mark I went to the counter and just waited there. They barely acknowledged me until I showed how far my number was behind in the buzzer collection.

Instead of attending to my order as I clearly, and patiently had asked them if my order was being prepared, the one worker kept working on every single order for another 15 minutes. To make up for this terrible wait, they gave me complimentary tater tots and fries. I still am disappointed by this lack of service to their customer.

Honestly, I would go back to the Time Out Market -- just not Pat LaFrieda.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I'll consider giving this another try but my first impression was okay. I think it would be very different if I ate. I went straight to the rooftop with friends to the bar. It was overcrowded and extremely hard to get a drink. They didn't have a lot of staff for the volume of customers and should've had more folks making drinks. So everything took long. We had to practically fight for a seat on the deck to get the view, but boy was it beautiful! I love my city!

The drinks were typical, nothing to rave about. I was hungry and was going to eat downstairs but once again, extremely crowded so we went to a local bar in the area that had food, drinks and ample space for me and my friends. I think if I had gotten to eat this may have been different. It's a food hall. And if I was able to go to a particular vendor I would've given a personalized review on their Yelp. But as a food hall in itself. It's pretty much like any other. There's a lot of variety. The area is instagramable considering the water and the views. Stop by, take a look, take a whiff, take a pic, take a bite. Do what you wanna do!

This market quite literally has something to love for everyone including some of my personal favorites such as Fish Cheeks, Jacob's Pickles, and Pat LaFrieda. My friend and I came here after Lucali's was closed for a private event but we were still determined to find a solid pizza place, which, of course, means Juliana's.

It's important to note that there is the original Juliana's right around the corner from the food market but, ironically, it had a super long line for it while the Juliana's in the market had no line whatsoever. On top of that, the rooftop has some beautiful views. The pizza itself I believe was the same price and was delicious.

Time Out Market New York,"Timing is everything, and on this past Sunday 1/25 we arrived down to the waterfront by 11 and had a completely different experience than our previous visit which was crowded and chaotic. Arriving when the market opened gives ample seating choices and virtually no wait for food. It's cold out,, and even the  Brooklyn Bridge was scant wIth pedestrians, so in the nice weather, expect more people all around.
Not too long ago, I attended a walking tour and visit to the Historical Society upstairs and learned so much about  the vibrant seaport. Once upon a time loaded with oysters and a major dIstributor of coffee. The brick factory type buildings were warehouses for supplies in great demand. Ships would pull up to the docks and load up their goods. Now it resembles a movie set, but it is quite authentic down to cobblestone streets.
I don't care if people think it's a trendy, tourist trap, I love it and the views are priceless.
Don't miss Jacobs Pickles. That does it for me with no need to look around. The chicken with the honey choice of the many toppings, is one of the greatest dishes that I have ever had. Just amazing.
On the way out Ample Hills is a small house on the walk to the water/dock.
No matter how many times I stand there flanked by the Brooklyn Bridge on the left and the Manhattan Bridge on the right, it takes my breath away. Water and the rocks and brick with these huge structures that took decades to complete, a lifetime ago without modern equipment, hover above, almost reaching the clouds. It is a treat to go up to the rooftop, especially when it's empty, and look around. It's amazing.
A long time ago I went to Turkey.  And never found the neighborhoods that best reflected Turkey and I did not like it at all. We were in the wrong places.

Time Out Market New York,"We came on Labor Day around 1pm and to our surprise, it was not that packed. In fact, it was pretty empty.

I get why people give this place a 1-2 star review. If it was packed and I'm rubbing elbows to order or fighting to get a seat to eat, I'd hate this place too. But it wasn't what I experienced.

We were able to stroll around and take our time. All the vendors showcased some incredible looking dishes. When can you ever get a bowl of authentic ramen from Taka, a side of Clinton Street Bakery pancakes, and ice cream from Ice and Vice all under one roof?

It's not as big as the Time Out Market in Lisbon, but it's also not as dirty looking. It's modern and chic and there is an awesome rooftop bar with a view.

And if you love West Elm furniture like she does, you can stuff your fat face and take a nap on one of their Andes sofa collections.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Overall, I had a great experience at the Market. I think that my friends and I lucked out by coming on Labor Day Sunday because it was not super packed. As a matter of fact, we easily secured enough seating on the roof for the eight of us. Maybe, it was a case of being at the right place at the right time. That said, I can imagine this place being a logistic nightmare on any other nice summerish weekend.

The bartenders use measured pours so if you like very strong cocktails, you may want to stick to beer or wine at the Market and have the strong drinks after your visit. For the most part, the bartenders were really great . . . especially for the number of customers that were barking drink orders at them. Obviously, the best part of Time Out Market is the view of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan's skyline. This is a great place to visit if you have a couple of visitors or newbies to NYC, but as a local, I probably would not come back.

They have just about everything you could ask for, including multiple floors. You can get Juliana's pizza upstairs, a chicken biscuit sandwich at Jacob's pickles, spicy ramen at Mr. Taka, oysters, Thai food, pastries and other sweets. Everything!

The best deal is probably the ramen at Mr. Taka at $16. You really can't find anything else cheaper than that that's a full meal.

The rooftop deck is awesome, and I would highly recommend going up there even though there's a lot of overpriced tacos up there.

The downstairs is dark and SO crowded. People elbow to elbow, especially during lunch time. I recommend finding a place with dedicated counter seating. Or just take your meal to go.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

We were already full from dinner so just decided to go to the rooftop and grab a drink and maybe eat something light. We ordered two drinks and both were very bad. I don't remember the drink name but I guess I ordered something unusual for my taste. My boyfriend ordered dumplings--5 tiny pieces that's a whooping $20?  Food was very mediocre at super high costs. I don't think it's worth making the trip here.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Initially, I had a great first impression of this place. It's the perfect spot to explore around Dumbo with groups of all sizes and then find perfect meals for everyone at the new Time Out Market.

This place was very underwhelming. I've heard about the crowds so I came on a calmer weekday evening. The building itself was structured really nicely, spacious and all sorts of bites and meals for everyone. The underwhelming part was the actual vendors in this place. Very very mediocre food at high costs. So not worth it.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Super fun ""food court"" to go to with many many different choices. Gorgeous views of dumbo, the bridge, and the water. A great spot to come during the holidays for cute decor and atmosphere.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I got the hummus from Little Alda and it was AMAZING!

We got the special, which was carrot hummus with labaneh, sage, brown butter, and sea salt. It was so flavorful and had warm, fresh pita with it.

The employees were also so sweet and very genuine. Would definitely eat here again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Time Out Market is an awesome addition to Dumbo. The interior and decor are super well done and the lineup of restaurants is impressive.

If you're comparing, Time Out Market doesn't have the diversity that Dekalb Market or Chelsea Market have. But, the quality of purveyors is excellent. With names like Breads, Jacob's Pickles, and Clinton Street Baking Company, you really can't go wrong.

We tried the chicken Caesar salad from Jacobs Pickles which was a huge portion and came with a biscuit. We also tried the pasta from Falice (we got it to go) which was reasonably priced and well made/sauced.

Time Out Market is a place not to be missed. It's also a great spot to take guests visiting since it's a destination by Brooklyn Bridge and offers gorgeous views of NYC.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"The location of this place is scenic. You have Jane's carousel and the entire Manhattan skyline right outside. The developers and architects did a nice job making the place beautiful with the rustic decor, especially compared to what this building used to look like! It's Dumbo, so you really can't screw that up!

A group of us came to check this place out on a Friday night around 6pm. It wasn't too crowded and there were plenty of seats. We tried a variety of places, including Clinton St. Bakery for coffee, Bessou for the crispy rice and fried chicken, Mr. Taka for ramen, Pat LaFrieda for a Philly cheesesteak, David Burke for their salad and their pork shank redemption mac and cheese, and ice cream at Ice & Vice. We also had drinks at their bar upstairs.

Positives: The food was good and the portions were large enough to share. It is nice to have a bunch of well-known NYC restos in one place and the team members who work to keep the place clean did a great job making sure the tables were clear and the place spotless.

Negatives: It was expensive! Yes, its Dumbo and yes, it's NYC, but for a food hall, it's pricey! Is it more expensive than Little Mercado, Industry City, or Dekalb's? Yes, depending on what you get. It's also not very close to the subways, so there's a bit of a walk that you need to account for.

Would I come back? Yes, but maybe when we have out of town visitors. I think the park in the front and the selection of food make this place a perfect spot to bring visitors young and old. But would I come here for date night? Probably not.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I earnestly tried twice to grab a bite here, but no go.
I know food halls are in demand and very trendy but seriously, this place is way too packed. I actually think the space was better off without it.

To many, it's exciting to have a diversity of vendors in terms of cuisines (of which will set you back by at least $20 and more) and with the addition of Time Out Market New York in Dumbo, it will definitely generate lots of profit. No doubt about it.
To be honest, I'm more inclined to go to a quiet restaurant and enjoy some good eats without feeling claustrophobic.

The main floor was super cramped/dark and no matter how long we waited, we were unable to grab a seat. It wasn't happening--at least on a Sunday afternoon. If a tight, cramped atmosphere is your idea of a great experience, I tip my hat to you.
The 5th floor seemed more spacious with just 4 vendors, a lounge area near the bar, outdoor space (again, all seats taken). I would consider grabbing a drink at their bar in the future.
You can wander around for a good while or maybe hit up the market during off hours and perhaps get lucky. I also wasn't very impressed with the vendor selections either.

Need to use the restroom on the main floor? Get ready for at least a 30 minute or longer wait. My experience. Gone are the days just waltzing into the restroom.  I feel meh about this place without even eating here.
I'm more inclined to hit up Eataly downtown, Brookfield or Dekalb Market. But overall, these insanely crowded food halls are not my thing.

You decide for yourself. Apparently most reviewers here on Yelp loved it.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"This is one of the newest food halls that seem to be cropping up all over New York. I recently moved nearby, and there is a lack of good food options in Dumbo/Downtown Brooklyn area, but Time Out Market, featuring many well known and popular restaurants, seemed like a promising option for a solid meal.
On a Friday at prime lunch hour, the market was busy, but not as busy as I've seen it on some weeknights. I opted for a sweet potato hummus dish that I'd had on another occasion from a restaurant outpost of Little Ada- at nearly $20, the dish was a bit expensive for a casual market, but tasted excellent, and the accompanying bread was fresh and went well with it.
My friend got cacio e pepe from the pasta bar. I wasn't expecting anything good, and my suspicions were confirmed once her plate was ready. The pasta looked decent, but was a bit bland. I didn't feel like eating any more after one bite.
Since a majority of the food places here are also restaurants that exist elsewhere in New York, I'd forgo eating here and go to the original restaurant location.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"The Time Out Market New York food court, located in the Empire Stores in DUMBO, Brooklyn, is a worthy destination, regardless of whether one is a tourist or local. The views from the rooftop are great, the curated list of food vendors is respectable, and there are many nearby attractions -- Brooklyn Bridge Park and Jane's Carousel are right out back. The mosaic glass house Kolonihavehus is right inside the Empire Stores' courtyard.

As far as I'm aware, the food court is a cashless environment that accepts credit / debit cards only. I think cashless helps with cleanliness. The credit card machines seem to default to asking for 15%, 18%, or 20% tips. It's an acceptable ask, because the food court issues real tableware for dine-in orders, and staff clean and clear table surfaces regularly. The trade-off is that tableware and trays are not allowed outside the food court areas, even inside the Empire Stores building. This can be frustrating, as seating can be difficult for groups.

The ground and fifth floors have different atmospheres. The fifth floor is bathed in sunlight. The ground floor has more food vendors, but seems perpetually darker, and tighter with narrower corridors.

A major issue with Time Out Market New York is that it has an insufficient number of restrooms. Consider using restrooms elsewhere before visiting, such as at Brooklyn Bridge Park's Environmental Education Center at 99 Plymouth Street. While you're there, check out Washington St at the corner of Front Street. There you'll find many people angling to take photographs of the Manhattan Bridge with a view of the Empire State Building through one of the bridge's arches.

It would be nice if Time Out Market could install a water trough somewhere to let groups of people simultaneously wash their hands.

Of the quarter of the stalls we've sampled so far, we like Bessou the most so far. They have an amazing Chicken Karaage -- fried chicken rice bowl.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Great place to hang out with friends! I like to have many options because everybody can get whatever they want!

And the view is a big plus!! Take the elevator to go to their roof area. It's super nice.

It's very spacious with many tables and chairs. The atmosphere is nice and cozy. I was expecting everything would be pricey but the prices aren't too bad!

Grab a bite or some drinks if you are in this area.
I will definitely come back again!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"After being a bit disappointed by Time Out Market Miami, I was hesitant to visit this new Brooklyn outpost on opening weekend. Maybe it's because I'm a tourist, but overall, I had a great experience and even my DUMBO dwelling friends seemed to agree.

There are 21(!) different vendors representing some of the city's best chefs and restaurants. There are two floors and you definitely don't want to miss the second floor where the outdoor patio has a great view of the water and Manhattan (not to mention some tasty eats like Juliana's pizza). If only the space to eat was a little bigger out there.The setup downstairs is a little dizzying and we had to do multiple laps to feel like we truly saw it all, but I think it's almost better that way to space out the crowd.

I was with a group of seven and we all tried something different for brunch. In the end, I feasted on the Loco Coco smoothie from Loco Coco, gravy smothered fried chicken and fried pickles from Jacob's Pickles, and an ice cream sandwich from DŌ which had cookie dough as the ""bun."" Fish curry, tonkatsu ramen, Nashville hot chicken, and an egg sandwich were among the other dishes that graced our table. There's really something for everyone.

We arrived around 10:30 am and most of the stalls didn't open until 11, unless they had breakfast menus (this made for a long line at Clinton St Baking Company). It was great though because we were able to easily find a seat and peruse the stalls before the crowds descended.

Similar to Miami, the prices aren't cheap and probably comparable to what you'll find at the actual restaurants. Even so, my local friends seem happy that they're now able to get some of their favorite dishes right here without having to wait in long lines for tables or journey to Manhattan.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Is this place full of WAY too many people on the weekend? Yes, is it worth it? YES.

Having been to the Time Out Market in Lisbon, I was stoked to hear that one was opening in Brooklyn. I knew it would be full of local staple food vendors...and that it would probably be more pricey. I was really shocked by how little the upcharge was, to be honest. I, of COURSE, headed to Jacobs Pickles (the fact that there is one in Brooklyn now just shorten my life span by 5 years) and found the offerings were the same price as they are at the main location on the upper west side. That said, you don't get a side and the portion of mac n cheese seemed a bit smaller (its served on a plate here not in a cast iron, so I could be off about that). That is the same though, is the quality. SO FRIGGIN' GOOD. also, to see the guys actually making the fried chicken was cathartic, as I had been wondering what this looked like for years (six deep fryers going at all times, makes total sense now).

The space itself is worth the trip. It is truly beautiful here, especially the rooftop bar and open-air deck. You can get some amazing pictures of lower Manhattan, then head into this auxiliary space for even more food options (what up Juliana), and a large bar with a lounge-like feel (the had a DJ playing chill music while we had a round and a bite of food).

All in all, I was super impressed. Come hungry, and with a debit card, as this place is cashless.

Time Out Market New York,"This spot is delicious, gorgeous, flanked with stunning views, spacious, worth the wait!

- Come on a weekday afternoon/evening and it won't be crowded at all

- Get the bolognese pasta or pomodoro pasta at Felice. Both are sensational but the bolognese is brilliant. Tastes like a dish in Italy. Felice is right by the opening of the market and your homemade pasta is made fresh. Say hi to Lisa, who is so kind and offered such great recommendations, like the bolognese and cacio e pepe

- Skip the crispy rices at Bessou and everything at Bessou, which is overpriced and the crispy rices with yellowtail, tuna etc. are served cold. The fried chicken is good, but not worth ordering again

- Say hi to Raj, who is so kind and thoughtful and works security at the market (also a sound engineer with his own studio!) who gives such great suggestions, such as Jacob's Pickles' fried chicken ""best food for the money!""

- Get the famous Juliana's Pizza on the fifth floor. The greatest margarita. Get the small and continue sampling the market. There's a reason they're known as the best pizza in New York, and now they're served fresh to you with ZERO line

- Head to the fifth floor's rooftop, grab a table, and gaze at this gorgeous city

Time Out Market New York,"Located in the same building that houses Cecconi's and DUMBO House, Time Out Market is in good company as the newest fancy food hall to open in the borough. They have an array of famous vendors, including Jacob's Pickles, Alta Calidad, Breads Bakery, Nakamura Ramen, and Ice & Vice. Take the prices that you'd expect of expensive food hall food and add a couple more dollars to it. That's how much food costs here.

I got a small group together to visit the market so we could sample more dishes. We ordered the shrimp tacos from Alta Calidad, the black garlic tonkotsu ramen from Nakamura, and a fried chicken sandwich w/side of mac and cheese from Jacob's Pickles. The chicken sandwich was enormous and could've easily been shared among two people for a full meal. The food was all around pretty solid, but I think cumulatively we spent more than we wanted to.

When you dine in, they serve food on real plates to cut down on waste, which I think is fantastic. I recommend taking your dishes out to the second floor deck on a nice day and enjoying the views of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"This is a nice new food court style market in the Dumbo area. With so many of the best restaurants in the city setting up shop here, you'll be hard pressed to find a cuisine or dish you will not like.

The way it works is: you place your order at the counter of your choice, and you're given a buzzer that will go off when your food is ready to be picked up. There are seating areas scattered throughout though some vendors have a bar-style seating as well.

The market is divided into two areas - a bigger lower area and a smaller upstairs dining room. The lower area felt cramped and a bit labyrinthine - it'll take a bit of exploring to see what's on offer if you don't consult a directory first. The upper level has a central seating area with vendors along the perimeter - much more open-feeling. And the rooftop area on the upper level is excellent! Some beautiful views of the Brooklyn bridge and lower Manhattan. There's a bar too where you can get a drink and enjoy it in a small fenced off area outdoors - perfect for summer!

A couple of negatives though - most of the vendors seem to only offer full size entrees, so it's very hard to sample small bites from different places which sort of defeats the purpose of a ""food market"". The other big negative is that the food is pricey - everything costs the same as it would in a sit-down restaurant, but without the service and ambiance of some of these iconic spots. Maybe the rent is really high here, who knows.

All in all a nice food court to eat a meal, if you have something in mind. And of course, that wonderful rooftop for some relaxed summer drinking.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Those of us who are proudly living in arguably the best borough of arguably the best city in the world talk about tourists like they are a new form of plague that has descended upon us. I've been a New Yorker for only one embarrassingly low street cred year, and even I am aggressively possessive of Brooklyn.

But here's the thing, when your friends or relatives come to town, and you only have time to show them very little of New York, Dumbo is kind of a safe choice. Sure, it's a bit too adorable and not the ""real Brooklyn"", but those views are freaking gorgeous. Picture yourself walking your friends into what they think is just a food court, and BAM! You smirk, and nonchalantly say ""Oh, and that's the Brooklyn Bridge on the left, and this is the Manhattan Bridge on the right."" Bucket list item of most is just a regular ol' walk to the trendy food court for you. Totally baller show off moment.

And yes, I have been here on a Sunday afternoon with absolutely nowhere to sit, but what else do we expect?! We are the dummies that showed up here on a weekend. All of Dumbo should be off limits to non-tourists on weekends, in my opinion. And yes, I begrudgingly waited for my friend as she stood in the dreadful 30min bathroom line on a Sunday. I also checked out the Time Out Market on a Thursday night and sat wherever my little heart desired all night (yes, I made my boyfriend move about three times ""so that we can experience it from all angles). The rooftop is the dopest, as (I think) the cool kids say.

Now the food itself is not anything to ooh and aah about, but as far as food courts go, I still declare this one as above most. The fish sashimi trio from Bessou is the most shamelessly Instagrammable snack of 2019 - the flavor was lacking a bit, but also I'm the one who forgot to grab the soy sauce and was then too lazy to go back for it. Steak tacos from Alta Calidad had plenty of steak, but the meat was a bit dry. The mini cheeseburgers from Pat LaFrieda were exactly what you'd expect mini cheeseburgers from a fancy shmancy food court to taste like. The prices were actually lower than what I expected to see. The highest up-charge is felt in the alcohol. BOOOO! Me likey wine.

I know there's a war of opinions raging about this new hot market that some love to hate, but to me, Time Out Market blended into Dumbo so effortlessly, I can hardly remember it without it. Or maybe I just don't care to. And I'm all for giving a beautiful old coffee factory building a new story.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I came here on a beautiful Saturday afternoon and it was hectic! I was able try several vendors, grab drinks and relax on the rooftop. It would've been more enjoyable if it wasn't so packed but that's probably not possible.

For food:

Pat LaFrieda's Mel's double burger: AVOIIDD!!! Literally the worse burger I ever had. The bun was stale and the beef was so dry and overcooked.

Alta Calidad's steak tacos: AVOID! The chipotle sauce was bland. The steak was tough and overcooked. There were few pieces completely burnt.

Bessou's The Trio: A variety of fresh fish on top of cripsy rice! Get it if you like ceviche or tartare. It was good and has very unique combinations of flavor. The crispy rice is soft on the inside.

Here's a couple things to keep in mind before going:

- You can sit ANYWHERE. Don't feel intimidated having different food at different vendors' bar stools.

- They do NOT take cash.. which makes no sense since that's a legal form of payment. Everything is overpriced don't be surprised.

- The workers do a great job cleaning and keeping self serving water stations full. No worries on where to dispose garbage.

- The rooftop bar has a small lounge with live music and a VERY small outdoor area with minimal view. Alcohol is not permitted on the large main rooftop which is a bummer.

- There's only 2 bathroom locations (lower floor and by rooftop bar). They really could use more for a big place like this. But if you want to avoid lines you can do what I did and sneak into Sugarcane.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"The sheer variety of food curated selections is amazing and while not as big as the Lisbon version the excitement is real at the opening. The throngs have descended and will continue to. It's impressive with a new Breads bagelry that brings Jerusalem style bagels to Brooklyn. Fish cheeks Thai fish house also stands out for its uniqueness.
Ate:
Cacio & Pepe from Felice pasta bar $16 and it was delicious. Twenty five vendors including one kosher vendor which means something for everyone is here. Decent seating for now and with warm weather so many take their food on the rooftop or outside. Cold weather will likely alter that. So many food halls in NYC now but this definitely brings some real NYC flavor!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Beautifully organized food market. We went the second weekend it opened. A lot of seating. Such a great variety of local businesses.

We ate at Pat La Frieda and had the black angus cheesesteak. Sooo good. A great fresh crunchy baguette wit a perfectly flavored cheesesteak.

We also had the crispy rice snacks and chicken karaage combo at Bessou. The yellowtail ceviche rice snack was the best tasting. The salmon was be was good once I spread around the wasabi aioli. The chicken was very tender. Loved the presentation of this dish.

Would love to return to try other restaurants. This place will be a hit this summer.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Overpriced mediocre food in a chaotic, crowded, dark place in an area that's oozing gentrification - I came because a foodie friend and I felt we should give it a go, and then again for the views.

We went straight to the top floor to snag one of the few tables on their rooftop at the end of the summer. This area is so small and it gets overrun so quickly with people constantly taking selfies, pictures of the view, pictures with them and the view in the background. Yes, I took some shots too, but not constantly or photo-shoot style - it's more an outdoor photo booth than a place to eat or drink.

Still, I took my American Mexican food from Ivy Stark out there and ordered a few cocktails from the bar. The bartender was incredible, and the lounge area inside has lovely large windows and tons of seating. They were playing classic rock which I loved - Beatles, Stones, Queen, Creedence Clearwater, Joan Jett.

They have a weird water bottle rule. They sell them, but offer free pitchers to fill glasses they provide at the end of the bar, asking you not to fill your bottles there. Why? Who cares? I saw a bartender refuse to fill a water bottle directing the person to a fountain somewhere else saying they weren't allowed to fill water bottles. What's up with the stupid rules? Just give people water, they need it to live.

From Ivy Stark I got the Seafood Cocktail ""Supermega"" with lobster, shrimp, crab, chilies, avocado, and also three pork belly carnitas tacos. I like my pork belly fatty, this wasn't, and it was dry. The pineapple and pickled red onions didn't add anything to this, I can't explain how. Maybe the meat itself hadn't been seasoned. The cocktail arrived in a pint glass with too few tortilla chips. It was difficult to scoop the seafood onto the chips without them breaking. I will say, the seafood was tasty and fresh. I just don't understand this presentation, a bowl would have more practical.  I've seen the tamarind stick stuck into glass being sold by street vendors but I wasn't sure what to do with it, I nibbled on it a bit but can't say I was pleased and it didn't incorporate with the rest of the meal. Can I use it to make a tampon joke with my friend? Because that's what ended up happening.

Another time I was passing through and decided to go for Bessou's sashimi trio over rice cakes. This looked good, and my pictures of it look good, but it was gross. The few bites of fish were fine, but the rice cakes were too gummy to eat. They stuck to my teeth and tasted like an overdone, over starched fast food hash brown. Really.

I didn't try another stall, listening to peoples conversations as I passed by, people didn't seem particularly thrilled with what they were receiving (one tourist said the other TO Markets in other countries are far better). I'd much rather just go to the real restaurant locations, Jacob's Pickles for example is a favorite and I just felt like I wasn't going to get the same quality here as I would there.

There's a second entrance to the rooftop right when you exit the elevators. There are no tables here, it's much bigger and there is a lovely extra wide wooden bench that allows you to lie down and look up at the sky. I came on September 11th and happened to catch the memorial lights, and it was a peaceful, beautiful night...until about two dozen Japanese tourists decided to whip out their tripods and spend 30 minutes taking endless timed selfies and shouting. Tripods are apparently not allowed in this area for this reason, because again, the whole area just becomes a photo booth. I took pictures of them taking pictures of themselves and offered to be in their photos with them so they could have a real live New Yorker in their memorial selfies - they didn't get the hint. Hope these guys gag on a gummy rice cake.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I am prematurely giving this place 5 stars because I've only been there just a few hours ago for the first time but - the sheer variety and amount of food options at this place is something to give them praises for!

The place was packed on this Friday afternoon.  Lots of line and wait times on most of the food stalls that I passed by (I went around to scope my first meal).  The pricing are decent for the area, this is DUMBO after all.

For my first meal, I went with Mr Taka and ordered their Tonkatsu Ramen Bowl ($15).  OMG I have achieved umami heaven.  All my thoughts of trying the other stalls here gone in an instant!  (At least for now.  Maybe on my 3rd visit, I'll try something new)

Stoped in for a drink, got one of the speciality cocktails they offer. The coconut carousel it was. Pretty damn tasty, the coconut rim really caused happiness.
Had the best bartender in the game I believe. Janna is her name! Hats off to her!

Across from the bar I was, there was a pasta...station let's say man was that delish!

Now I will say on a Sunday afternoon it was very crowded. The lines for the bathrooms were intense. Went upstairs, the line was a way shorter but still waited some time.

Upstairs there really is a nice view also outside eating area. Not that large of an area but it was cute. To go there on a not so packed day would be great!

Time Out Market New York,"This market definitely has potential to be a go-to Brooklyn rooftop. I came here in the evening on opening day and first scoped out the food scene downstairs although I wasn't hungry. There's a lot of selection with some familiar names like Ice & Vice, Breads Bakery, and Avocaderia, but found menu items to be on the pricier side across the board.

I ended up grabbing a glass of wine upstairs on the Time Out 5th Floor roof, which features a bar and a few other food booths. Definitely preferred the ambiance up here versus downstairs. Drinks were fairly priced what for I'd expect from a rooftop bar; my glass of pinot grigio was $10. The bartenders were friendly although the service was slow - hard to blame them for opening night though. The view from up top can't be beat, overlooking the Brooklyn/Manhattan bridges right along the waterside. Upstairs there was a decent amount of indoor seating (featuring large windows), while the outdoor space was tighter.

The rooftop bar is a great addition to DUMBO and I'll be back for it. However, I'll personally skip out on the food hall downstairs - although it's not a bad place to bring out-of-towners looking for a one-stop-shop of quintessential New York eats (at New York prices).",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Came here before closing around 11. There are so many options!! Unfortunately a lot of shops were already closed but that just gives me another reason to come back.
We had the tonkatsu ramen from mr.taka ($15). The noodles itself were great but the broth was a little too salty. It's a super rich and suuuuper thick broth. The portion was very filling.
Right across from Mr.Taka is Bessou.
I think the concept and execution worked so well. We got the trio of the crispy rice ($21) and a bento bowl (don't remember). The tuna was super fresh, there wasn't any fishy after taste to it. The fresh fish on the crispy rice works so well together.

I ordered the Avo Burger from Avocaderia. It's a whole avocado with smoked salmon, brown rice, and some sauces, garnish, seasoning in the middle and on top. Over a bed of dry kale. For $16+ dollars.

Time Out Market New York,"Interesting concept, but very crowded and having been to the Time Out Market in Lisbon, the layout here is terrible, with half the food stalls upstairs and the downstairs stalls in an unorganized maze.

We sat upstairs and too tired to go back downstairs to get food from Pat LaFrieda's, I settled for David Burke's. Make no mistake, just because this is cafeteria style, it does not mean it's fast food. In fact the girl at the counter informed me she was not taking orders for another 10 minutes. Fifteen minutes later, I was finally able to order the hipster steak frite and spicy crab dumplings. The dumplings were terrible - doughy and lacked any flavor or taste. The steak (served on curly fries - I guess that's what makes it hipster) was ok, I was underwhelmed. For the amount of time it took and cost of $49, it was not worth it. Got a nice seasonal beer at the bar.

I would like to come back and try some of the other vendors. There's lots of seating scattered both downstairs and upstairs. There's also an outdoor rooftop area for warmer months. I recommend you come here during off peak times, otherwise it's a zoo!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I just really like this spot. Its definitely a go to place.to take friends and family visiting NYC.

Its filled with different levels of dining. At the bottom its basically a food court where you can find different meals to wet any appetite. The rooftop is amazing and has really great views! I highly recommend going up!

There is seating but tends to be crowded as well as some places have their own bar style seating.

The building itself has a rustic industrial style look with large windows on the outside. There's a carousel for kids as well on the outside. The place is very Instagram picture friendly. You can also sit on the outside and admire the bridges, sea the boats pass by   or just simply people watch.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Love this place its great and they have 1000 food options, but if you're coming here on the weekend don't expect to find a seat it's actually impossible to be seated within 10 minutes.

Time Out Market New York,"5 stars for location 4 stars for food and price 2 stars for dining and drinks logistics issues. Great location right next to the Brooklyn waterfront by Janes Carousel. Plenty of good food options from ramen to sushi, chicken and biscuits, sandwiches, oysters, and plenty more. All players seem to be around $8-$10 appetizers and $15-$30 entrees depending on which establishment you go to and where you order. The only downside is that indoor seating is very limited with a small counter at each stand and a dozen or so communal tables by the main entrance. There are  park benches and tables outside but because the food is served in actual plates that becomes a lot of weight to carry when you're trying to find a table and also not drop anything. The biggest issue however is drinks. Food vendors do not sell or serve drinks and that includes water and soda not to mention Alcoholic beverages. So in order to get a drink you now have to carry your food to one of the many bars and order it there. Seems like an unnecessary step. Also when you're done eating you have to bring your plates and utensils back inside otherwise it'll just pile up on the outdoor tables and no one will be about to sit.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Very cute and trendy food court in Brooklyn! Stopped here for some treats after riding the carousel and was excited by all the options! I went to a bakery and grabbed and almond croissant and chocolate mousse dessert. Pricy but very tasty!

Time Out Market New York,"I liked the layout of Time Out Market more than other food halls I've been to. Maybe it's that everything is similarly branded and less busy-looking? It just feels way more cohesive and it didn't make me feel like I had to be studying each menu. The toughest part is seating, especially during the colder months when we went. But honestly there's a lot I'd love to try here, so I'll take the seating challenge. I ordered spaghetti and butternut squash soup from the pasta vendor. Both were delicious and multiple people stopped to ask where I ordered the dishes. Sadly I couldn't remember the name, but it was the first vendor across from the drink bar at the main entrance. Then, I indulged in dessert from dough. If you want to eat to your heart's content, there's probably something for you at Time Out Market.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Time Out Market in Dumbo was a great idea for an outing. My friend and I tried different dishes from Jacob's Pickles, Nur and a Asian restaurant offering pork belly buns so we had a little bit of everything. We also had cocktails downstairs and up on the terrace. They were delicious, strong and not very expensive. It's a perfect place to go when it's on the warmer side, but can also be crowded. The views were incredible and there was a little something for everyone!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Time Out Market New York,"It's been two weeks since I visited but would highly recommend coming here. It's a cool sprawl of restaurants and bars between two floors. Like, an upgrade to Chelsea Market.

I spent most of my time on the rooftop level, and ate at David Burke. I got the lobster (or it might have been crab) dumplings. Those were really good. Also, I got the Hipster Steak Frites. It was definitely hipster because it was a steak sitting on top fries mixed with lettuce. The lettuce was wet and unexpected. That ruined it for me, but it was still a decent meal.

Right off that space is the bar, with amazing drinks. I sampled several of them with friends and you can't go wrong with any of them.

The only downside is that everything here is pricey. Sure, I'll spend $14+ on cocktails and $20+ on an entree, but at times it felt overpriced.

This place is a must if you're in DUMBO, but beware of the food and drinks. It's so good you might end up racking up a large bill like I did.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Time Out Market New York,"Time Out Market is a super cute food court area that recently opened. The food court has a view of the city and Brooklyn bridge, with many vendors and ofc the aesthetic vibe of Brooklyn. The place is a bit overwhelming as there are so many vendors, the smells coming from everywhere, and the title of each store is in the same layout.  

I went to Busan, which was a homemade Japanese food store, and ordered the chicken kaarage set. I thought it was going to be your basic fried chicken and rice with sides, but.. wow my mind went blank at the taste of their fried chicken. The crunchy flavorful exterior of the chicken was over the moist chicken, the combination of the chicken, rice, kale salad and the seaweed sides were mouthwatering.

Their bathroom situation is a bit undesirable, as there are only 2 bathroom locations, there was a file of 25 ladies lined up for a 4 bathroom area and there was no lines for the men however, the line moved fast so it was no big deal.

When you walk up to the fourth floor you get a beautiful view of the boardwalk and the Brooklyn bridge!

I can't wait to try the other vendors around the area!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Absolutely loooooved Time Out Market. Conveniently located in the DUMBO area, I came here on a weekday afternoon to get some work done with a friend. Was busier downstairs but you're allowed to grab food and bring it to the seating area on the 5th floor accessible by elevator! Wonderful atmosphere and all the staff around the area was very nice. We found a spot with a plug and were able to enjoy our food and get some work done (the free WI-FI was a huge plus). Before or after you can take a walk around the DUMBO area and get great pictures by the Brooklyn bridge!

Juliana's (located on the 5th floor): We got the margherita pizza and it was just as advertised! They don't skimp out on the mozzerella and we got out 11' pizza in less than 15 minutes. The pizza is also totally affordable in an otherwise expensive area for food.

Clinton St. Baking company (ground floor): The crispy potato pancakes with smoked salmon was amaaaazing! They had a solid amount of hollandaise sauce and the potatoes were cooked to perfection.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Time Out Market New York,"The design and layout of the market is amazing. Roof top is so chill with great vibes. Patio outside is amazing with great views of the water and the bridge.  

There is a great assortment of food options and vendors to choose from.  The price points are the same as their restaurant counterparts and for a food hall they expect you to also pay tip. I suppose it's for the dishwashers since they use dinner plates and actual utensils which is pro environmentally friendly.  There are actual cleaning staff that clear your trays and your dishes.  They had music on floor 5 which is nice.

Why I am giving it 3 stars is for the bathroom situation.  There are 2 floors of the hall. Floor one and floor 5.  Both of which has bathrooms but I fear they didn't plan enough? I get it, real estate square footage is $$$ but I felt like they skimped out on the bathroom design and square footage. I also don't like how the bathrooms on the floor 5 are shared for both male and female for cleanliness reasons.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

They also have free flavored water available to patrons which was a nice tough.

I visited the Jacob's Pickles, Juliana's, and Pat LaFrieda stands. In all cases, food was ready within 10 minutes, which gave adequate time to either explore more or find a seat.

Everything I ate was absolutely delicious - I got fried pickles from Jacob's Pickles, cheesestake from Pat Lafrieda's, and the No. 4 from Juliana's.

Time Out Market New York,"This place is insane!  Insanely amazing!  So much fun and good food galore.  Amazing water views!  Bring your peeps and check this place out.  

Twenty one eateries to choose from and 3 different bars areas.

I've tried a few of the food stalls and Bessou's Fried Chicken karaage bento bowl, was my favorite.  The flavors and different textures was spot on, so amazingly good.  Get this!  This is a must get!  I've had it 3 times already.

Seating:  There is plenty of seating all around the food court.  You can take your food and sit anywhere you like.  

Bathrooms:  Not enough.  For such a huge place, there is only 4 stalls in the women's bathroom, so the line to get in was 20+ people.  (What brilliant mastermind thought up this brilliant scheme).  And of course, little to no wait for the men's bathroom.

Tip:  The best time to enjoy this place is during off hours.  During prime hours, this place is packed to the gills with people.  Long awkward lines to order food.  Squeezing by lots of people just to get by.  No empty seats found.  Just horrible.  

I've always gone during off-peak hours and have had a blast!  And no problem finding seats.  Also go upstairs to check out the beautiful scenic water views!  And while you are in the neighborhood, check out the beautiful carousel outside.

Time Out Market New York,"The perfect spot for taking your friends/family who are unfamiliar to New York.

The Timeout Brooklyn Market is better than I expected. My biggest fear was crowds. And while there were crowds, and people not moving, and tourists, it has never been overwhelmingly bad while I was there. But for love of god please don't stand the middle of a walkway.

There's so many amazing food options. I was sold when I heard they had Pat LaFrieda. That steak sandwich is no joke. Jacob's Pickles, Julianna's, I can keep going. Rest assured there's tons of options to eat.

They have a nice bar downstairs. Be aware the place does not accept cash, anywhere. The bar you want to check out though is upstairs. Couches, a DJ, awesome drinks, and those VIEWS! The Brooklyn Bridge and East River are the perfect backdrop.

It's the best place to bring someone to give them a taste of New York. Delicious food, great sites, a place to party, and the overcrowding/traffic that makes you question everything you're doing in life. Oh New York.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Time Out Market New York,"Time Out Market New York looks amazing! Lots of options to choose from. For our first time we choose Bessou and Pat LaFrieda!

Bessou - 1 star
- Way overpriced, chicken karaage bento was ok, the side dishes were yummy! But the chicken itself was nothing special, they didn't even provide Japanese rice, was cheap rice. (I know cause I eat a lot of rice and I'm asian. Lol)

- DO NOT GET CRISPY RICE. I REPEAT DO NOT GET THE CRISPY RICE TRIO!!!!!
crispy rice was so not worth the $$$. Seafood was definitely not fresh, taste is nothing special.

Pat LaFrieda-5 stars
- we ordered the cheesesteak with a side of fries. The sandwich was GREAT! Juicy and very tasty! You could taste the beef and herbs combined  fries were ok, thick cut, crispy, nothing special.

Would definitely come back to try out other places! (Except for Bessou. Lol)",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"A foodie's heaven -- can't believe we just discovered this place!

Since we knew we didn't have enough room in our stomachs to eat everything, we started by eye shopping around all the food stands that were so enthralling and enticing. I was particularly fascinated by the ginormous bagel circles from the Amy's bread bagel stand. Extra fresh pastries from the normal Amy's bread pastry stand diagonal to the bagel stand (same room). We loved the chicken and pickle concept, and we got married at Felice.

At the end, we narrowed our selection to try Thai at Fish and Cheeks. We shared a tom yum soup with king prawns and noodles. It was delicious and not cheap but worth the experience. We also finished with Japanese fried chicken and a sashimi trio on fried rice. What a neat experience.

We topped it off by going to the outdoor gorgeous rooftop upstairs and took pictures of the famous bacon strips. We loved the entire experience!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Time Out Market New York,"Very large industrial space (maybe too large?), offering a very handy assortment of every trendy restaurant you'll see written up in Eater/Time Out New York.  Mr. Taka, Fish Cheeks, Jacob's Pickles (a good and value laden option), Bessou, etc. You get the idea.  The problem is, that if feels cramped at peak times, and you'll struggle to find seating to eat your food, or transport your food through the hordes of people and snaking lines. It's very hectic, and not so relaxing. Yet, prices are pretty much comparable to the more relaxed full-service restaurant version.  I tried Miami's version recently, and it seemed to have a better layout.

The upper roofdeck and bar feels a bit more relaxed, so this is the part of the market I prefer.  While demand is heavy for an outside table during warm weather days, it is generally easier to navigate and the rewarding waterfront view is well worth the hunt.  

So my verdict?  I'm torn.  I was kind of excited at opening weekend, but honestly, my real issue with all of this, is how very slick and corporate it feels.  Over-exposed. I don't feel like I'm supporting the little guy anymore, which is what I feel like I should be doing.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I think the location is great and is nice to have so many different options, because when you're in a group everyone might be craving for different things.

My only complaint is the list of vendors that were selected to be featured at the market. Clearly hey had the tourists in mind when making these selections. As a born and bred New Yorker and knowing all the amazing food that this city has, they could've done a better job.

I did enjoy the steak tacos from Alta Calidad and the fried chicken from Bessou, Ice & Vice is always solid. My friend complained that the mac and cheese form Jacob's Pickles had way too much cheese.

Another callout!  why have such a beautiful rooftop deck if you can't freely walk around with your drink, they should've made the eating/drinking area wider.

Overall cool spot but if it's out your way there's no need to come here.

So far the best time out market i've been to is the one in Portugal",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Great food everywhere!

I've been here several times and decided to try out the bar last night with my wife. If you stick to the menu, it's fine.  My wife tried to order a toasted almond, which has Kahlua, amaretto and milk.  The bar had neither milk nor cream.  They also don't have Bailey's Irish Cream which can be used as a substitute in a pinch.   This was very weird that a bar like this wouldn't have milk.  I asked if the other bars in the market might have milk and he said they are all the same company and don't stock it.  Two cocktails ended up costing about $33 and I couldn't even get what my wife wanted to drink.

Time Out Market New York,"This place is absolutely a must go to when you're in Brooklyn. My best friend and I went to NYC for the first time and when we got to Brooklyn, we were overwhelmed with the food options. We saw this place when we were looking out from the Brooklyn Bridge and decided to check it out.

The location is in a prime spot where you're surrounded by water with views of the bridge and city. The inside ambiance was a fantastic Sunday lunch spot with live music, view of the the bridge in the water, a busy bar that I assume was great (I don't drink), and plenty of options of food to choose from.

We were so happy we came here because I was craving Mexican and my friend was craving something else so this accommodated both our needs.

Food-

Since I'm a vegetarian, I got the vegetarian street tacos. I paired this with the street corn (one of my best street corn I've eaten), and a dirty coconut horchata. The tacos had so much flavor from the meatless chimmichurri, light veggies, and a simple yet flavorful red sauce with lime. The street corn had a lot of perfect flavors and very creamy. I was ready to get another 2 orders! 3 people approached me during lunch just to ask what I ordered and I highly recommended the street corn! I wasn't a big fan of the dirty coconut horchata though. It was thicker then how I usually like my horchata and had too much coconut chunks. I'll stick to my regular ones horchata..

Time Out Market New York,"After helping the hubs out with a few photoshoots at DUMBO and making use of the public bathrooms located inside Empire Stores, I started noticing construction for a Time Out market in NYC! Not that NYC has a shortage of food halls, but the vendor list really excited me (Clinton St., Jacob's Pickles, Bessou!) so I anxiously stalked them on IG until they opened.

Finally got the chance to check the space out this past weekend on a gorgeous sunny Sunday. We rolled in just before noon and I was actually surprised that the place wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. Hubs and I did a quick circle around the market and settled on a crispy rice + karaage (fried chicken) combo from Bessou and a stack of pancakes from Clinton St., with mental notes to try Jacob's Pickles the nxt time we return.

Placed our order for Bessou and was informed that all drinks (alcoholic and non) were to be ordered at the bar. The Food Hall I went to in Amsterdam was the same, so I wasn't put off by this.We went to the bar and easily ordered a coke (w/ unlimited refills at any of the 2 bars on the first floor or the 1 bar on the 5th!), and they had water stations with plastic cups nearby.

We sat at the counter at Bessou and our meal was ready quickly. Definitely paying for quality over quantity. Two crispy rice (yellowtail & tuna) plus 3 pieces of juicy succulent karaage came in at $21. Definitely not cheap but the food was delish - obsessssed with the yellowtail crispy rice in particular. Would def return for this (or just get it from the Bessou in Noho!).

We finished up at Bessou around 12:30pm and noticed it was getting increasingly busy, but still not insufferable. We wandered over to Clinton St. and ordered a stack of blueberry pancakes for $17. The cashier informed me the wait was around 30-40mins prior to me paying, which I appreciated! We found a few seats not too far away and waited with our buzzer. About 42 mins later, we got our pancakes! Super yummy. The maple syrup concoction is TDF. Another great thing about Time Out Market is that the cleaning staff is on top of their ish!

After sufficiently stuffing ourselves, we checked out the 5th floor. Pro tip - there is an elevator inside the market which everyone uses, but the elevator right outside the market goes up too. I was obsessed with the interior design of the 5th floor - from the neat wall design of various region's Time Out mags, to the seating and layout of the food space, to the cute little outdoors section. Please note - the DUMBO club is above the market so don't get too jelly seeing people taking a dip in the pool. It's not accessible to the public.

I loved the 2 hours I spent at the market and honestly my only gripes are that the food is on the pricier side and that the bathroom sitch stinks! 5th floor bathrooms are co-ed and the ground floor bathrooms are separated (I actually recco the ground floor bc there are like 5 stalls for women and typically no wait for men). More restrooms please!!!! Otherwise, a great day in BK. Can't wait to return!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Visited on a rainy Saturday with a group of five and was underwhelmed with what is basically an overpriced mall food court with an awkward layout, terrible acoustics and a generic Nu-Brooklyn look.  The overall aesthetics weren't helped by the fact that all the restaurants use the exact same signage, so it's hard to tell the purveyors apart.  We had to wander around for awhile to find a table that could accommodate us...

And then there's the mediocre food, served up by lackadaisical, fast-food caliber (and no doubt underpaid) staffers who were simply executing a system rather than preparing the food with care.  A friend's Pat Lafrieda sliders were burnt to a crisp, a bowl of Mr. Taka's ramen was cold on arrival as were pancakes from Clinton St. Baking (never got the signal from the little vibrating alert thingie they give you when you order, and no one could say why).  The bartenders at the downstairs bar were friendly enough but really didn't know what they were doing if someone ordered off the limited cocktail menu.  In fact, no one working in this place seemed to know what they were doing, or to care.  It's also outrageously expensive (seriously, Pat Lafrieda, $16 for a meh chicken sandwich I had to fetch myself from your surly and incompetent counter workers?).  

The lack of adult supervision/quality control here was depressing, as was the dim basement vibe of the downstairs food hall.  Maybe we hit an off day or something, but I doubt it - this place has the feel of a faux 'upscale' Vegas attraction.  For tourists only - this isn't New York city food.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I checked out the food market on its opening weekend with my girlfriend and a friend. I was very impressed with how smoothly everything was operated. They had just the right amount of seating. There were several entrances and exits as well as a couple was to maneuver through the market so that traffic flowed well. Each business provided a buzzer to notify you when your order was ready; this allowed you to grab a seat while waiting and reduced congrestion. Lastly, the businesses used the same reusable utensils and dining ware to promote sustainability. Well executed concept.

The food was great too. We started with some oysters and a curry soup from fish cheeks. The oysters were fresh; i believe they were from Prince Edward island. The soup was spicy and very flavorful. Next, we shared salmon fried rice cakes from bessou. This was my first time trying fried rice cakes and they made a great first impression. We followed this up with a fried chicken sandwich with mushroom gravy on a biscuit from Jacob's pickles. This dish was the epitome of savory. Our next item was a very unique Caribbean mexican fusion. We had a chorizo open roti from Alta calidad. We finished our marathon meal with legendary babka from breads bakery.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Based on the high prices and inconvenience, I'm not sure it is worth it.

The market is poorly designed. It is extremely tight and crowded -- you will have to navigate through narrow alleys of clueless tourists who stand a weird daze looking up at menu displays or lingering for their food to be ready.  

Most lunch items are $15 to $30.  It is a very cramped experienced. You are probably better off going to a restaurant in the area where you can sit and relax for the same price.

But note, there is a lesser known area of the TimeOut Market on the 5th floor of this building, with three vendors and a bar. It is more enjoyable and has a great view!",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"From my point of view, this is my kind of attraction, 3 stories worth of fine food and drink all tucked neatly under the Brooklyn bridge. Nod of thanks to my friend James Walker for directing me to check this place out. Since its tight on parking, i suggest you arrive and depart in an Uber or Cab. To tough thing about this magnificent collection of food kiosks is making a choice- You want to get a steak sandwich from Pat La Frieda, Oysters from Fish Cheeks, hit the David Burke tavern, hang out on the rooftop bar and deck with stunning city views. Okay, it's a little touristy, but who cares, I'm a tourist that day. Fugetabout those vain hotties on the roof deck from Singapore, or Japan, posing and snapping selfies with the bridge and skyline in the background. My point is, there is something exceptional for everyone here. You can come in, eat and get out or hang out and people watch and eat for hours, either way it's time well spent.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Glad the Market is open but the vendors we tried are in DESPERATE need of some more training.

First of all, most of the vendors don't open until 11 AM despite the Market's hours listing 8 AM as the opening time. Make sure you double check with the specific stall if there's something you have your eye on.

There are a few outdoor tables (unshaded) which are pet friendly and have a great view of the water.

Clinton St Baking had an hour wait once order was placed on Sunday morning around 10 AM. They do give you a buzzer so you can wander around while waiting. We asked for the blueberries on the side - when we got the pancakes, they were already cold. I also noticed that the middle pancake had blueberries smeared all over it... almost like they had put the glob of blueberries on top, realized their mistake and scraped it off, and then hid the pancake in the middle of the stack -___-

At Loco Coco, none of the fruit was pre-cut. This was extremely inefficient as the two workers were literally cutting the fruit to order, meanwhile the line is getting longer by the second. It took almost 30 minutes for an acai bowl ($14) to be made.

Breads Baglery was probably my favorite, despite taking over 30 minutes also. The salmon and eggs on a bialys was a classic combination.

Wouldn't bother coming mid-day because I can see this being an absolute catastrophe with crowds. Would like to give the other vendors a try but maybe in a couple of months once things are up and running more smoothly.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Enjoy!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"The name of this place slips my mind but the tacos were delicious and filled with mouth-watering meat and colourful garnishments. I almost opted for Mediterranean food next door but I'm so glad I tried this stall instead. In addition to their chalkboard menu, be sure to take a look at the small special/daily features menu right in front of the cash register - that's where I ordered mine, which I believe was pulled pork! Even if you don't have tacos, Time Out Market is definitely worth the stop as the outdoor patio features an obstructed view of the Brooklyn Bridge. This was such a reward especially after having crowded at the famous Dumbo photo spot with other tourists. There's also a beautiful bar with a giant water station for you to stay hydrated.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"So many good food options to choose from! I highly recommend the hot chicken Sammie's from Jacobs Pickles. The biscuits are super flaky and buttery and the chicken is incredibly juicy and flavorful. Also make sure to stop by Fish Cheeks for authentic Thai food that is refreshingly not pad thai.

If you come here at night, make sure to bring a date because it is just beautiful. Some nights they have a dj or some sort of live music. During the day, it's mostly tourists and families with kids. So depending on what time you get here, it can cater to any crowd.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I was excited about this market because of its great selection of restaurant stalls, but unfortunately it fell short of my expectations. Each stall has a very limited selection of food that doesn't do the actual restaurants justice. The problem with Time Out is that most things sounds fantastic but taste mediocre, even the drinks at the upstairs bar.
Pro: The space itself is spacious and great for just hanging out. Fantastic view of the Brooklyn Bridge from the upstairs roof and close to the waterfront.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Newest addition to the market craze.  Bonus points for location near pier 1 and views of the bridges, East River, and the Manhattan skyline.  Lots of trendy food outposts available and the largest seating available in any NYC market we've visited.       Shared Pat LaFrieda, Jerusalem bagel, and do.  Food vendors do not sell beverages ( alcoholic or otherwise) .... you have to order separately at one of two bars. Slightly disappointing outdoor seating options with many parties stalking tables even on a Tuesday. As others have said, bathrooms were not well planned.  Visitors from out of town should be aware 5th floor is the top ( higher visible rooftop space is a private club )",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"When I heard about Time Out Market and the many food vendors they had recruited, I was excited to check it out first hand. The market does not disappoint. On the bottom floor some food vendors include Fish Cheeks selling delicious Thai food and fresh oysters, Bessou with their fried crispy rice topped with sashimi, Alta Calidad and their variety of tacos, among many others. The layout is appealing with plenty of tables to enjoy whichever food you choose. We split some tacos at Alta Calidad, but I had I gone to the rooftop first, I definitely would have gotten food there instead. The rooftop has beautiful views of the river, an impressive bar, and additional food vendors including Nur. However, it is clear Time Out has vetted all of these vendors, carefully choosing the best. All options seem good and it is a place that will require many return visits to try the many places.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I always love food court, where I can find many food options in 1 place and this market didn't disappoint! Their food vendor selection is brilliant.
My fav vendors here are ice & vice, Felice, Bessou, Clinton Street, Fish cheek, David Burke, Jacob's pickles.

Also, they have Rooftop with amazing view of Brooklyn bridge and Manhattan bridge. Wish they have more seatings on rooftop.

Speaking of seating and space, wish they have more seatings and the space between booths is quite narrow so it's hard to walk if this place is crowded.

Downtown brooklyn has evolved as an extension of downtown Manhattan and that means there's a few rooftops to enjoy the very few days of good weather we have in nyc ( thanks global warming )

Enter time out market ... a smaller version of the dekalb market and seemingly more expensive ( you pay for the view)

Time Out Market New York,"When in NYC I try to hit all the hot spots and thanks to my cousin and a great family outing we all took a little trip to DUMBO and got to experience it together for the first time. I was overwhelmed by all the food options, yet super excited at the same time. In the end I decided to get the fried chicken at the Jacob's Pickles stall. Overall, it's delicious, however my only gripe is that my chicken, which was the honey chicken and pickles they drenched it with honey and that over powered a lot of the chicken and the biscuit. So I had to eat the parts that didn't have that much honey. But when I'm back in DUMBO, I'll definitely try the other stalls. And rejoice Boston, we will get a time out market of ours as well very soon!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,Amazing food vendors! each vendor has a limited menu to focus on bringing folks quality over quantity. The chicken karage in Japanese homestyle cooking was the star of the show. So juicy on the inside and crunchy and chewy fried batter on the outside. Seasoned with spicy mayo and seaweed on top. The view just took my breath away. End the fabulous day with a scoop of ice cream from the market as you walk along the pier and carousel near by.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I'm sure large crowds could really ruin the experience here, but I had a fabulous time this Wednesday afternoon. The rooftop bar has amazing views (even the outdoor space on the lower level has a top notch view of Manhattan). The food choices are high end but reasonably priced. You'll be tempted to dabble in all the options but you could easily spend $15-20 bucks at each vendor. Roughly $8-10 for a beer and $13-15 for cocktails. The rooftop bar has a separate liquor license from the main level on the ground floor so although you can drink in both areas, you can't travel up and down with your beer. I ate the margarita pizza with pepperoni from Juliana's on the roof and then the Mel's Double Burger at Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors on the ground floor - both excellent renditions of the classics that I highly recommend. This place is such a great addition to the DUMBO scene!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I was so excited to hear that a Time Out Market was opening up in NYC! The streets around the market are pretty hectic, but you can find parking like ~10 min walk away pretty easily.

There are 2 floors to the market- so many vendors! 2nd floor has indoor and outdoor seating. There's also musicians who play as well. I got to try Juliana's, Jacob's pickles, and the modern Mexican restaurant on the 2nd floor (can't recall the name). Highly recommend Juliana's and Jacob's pickles! The Mexican restaurant... not so much. They give you buzzers for the restaurant so you can walk around as you wait.

Juliana's:
We got the 16 in. pizza (~$30)- the one with prosciutto, mozzarella, and arugula. It was so crispy and not oily at all! Fed 4 people perfectly. Took exactly 30 minutes.

Jacob's Pickles:
GET THEIR FRIED CHICKEN BISCUITS!!!! They honey chicken and nashville hot chicken is their most popular. You can't go wrong with any of them tho. They're hugeeeeeee. Also, get the special max & cheese. They use penne and there's buffalo chicken inside. Their fried pickles are not bad, but nothing to rave about.

For the modern Mexican restaurant on 2nd floor, don't get the enchiladas. It was small and surprisingly bland despite being drenched in sauce. The fish tacos were good though, but there were only 3 small tacos. Def try the Mexican place on the first floor instead- I saw other people get that later on and they looked realllly good.

They have a bar as well for drinks. Moderately priced- prob like ~$10 per drink.

Service is really good here. They frequently come around to take your finished plates and trays away. They also keep the bathroom clean and open the doors for you.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Had such a fun time at Time Out! I went with a friend on a Saturday around noon and had such a fabulous time. First of all, the location is incredible. DUMBO is such a fun area on Brooklyn with great views of Lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge, and plenty of seating right on the water.

We chose to split two items, a pitaya bowl from Loco Coco and a vegan bowl from Bklyn Wild. After getting our food we went right up to the fifth floor rooftop to eat, though there was plenty of seating downstairs (we wanted to enjoy the sunshine!) There are more food options on the ground floor but the indoor AND outdoor seating is way better upstairs! Definitely would recommend taking your food up for some fantastic views. The food was very very good and the service was great - they have people monitoring around the tables to pick up your finished plates. They also had cucumber-infused and lemon-infused water which was so refreshing!!

We left around 2 pm and it was quite busy at that time, with open seating hard to come by. If you're looking to stay at the market for a while I'd definitely recommend coming on the earlier side, but if you just want to come in for a meal or snack to-go you'll definitely be able to find seating near the water at any time of day.

I'll definitely be back at some point to try more of the vendors at enjoy that awesome rooftop. I was a little disappointed at how expensive everything was (each of our dishes was ~$17) so I'll definitely bring friends to split stuff and save some money.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"A really nicely arranged, designed, and clean food hall. A good amount of seating areas around the hall and at each vendor. Cleaning staff seemed on point to help take dishes away when done and clean the area.
The walkways were big enough for two lane traffic and people to stand at the wall to wait for their food.

Since this spot is new, it's going to be packed and become a tourist attraction/trap.
As for the food, it's AVERAGE at best and OVERPRICED. I wouldn't come back nor recommend to friends.

I got tonkatsu ramen and friend got pasta. Both were MEH and not worth the price. Ramen in the city is usually $15 and here it was over $20. Nowhere near/on par to city ramen. It tasted more on par to cheap ramen. The pasta was bland and felt undercooked. Kinda tasted like they used cheap parmesan...yea I'm getting repetitive",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Stumbled upon this food hall by Brooklyn Bridge Park that has a great lineup of vendors. Definitely a good spot to come with a group of friends and try a bunch of different foods.

There's plenty of seating and they reuse plates and utensils instead of going through paper plates. The staff is also really attentive and help bus your dishes for you (which felt a little weird since you don't have to tip them...) but I'm not gonna complain. Plus I hear there's a nice rooftop bar that I'm going to have to check out next time I'm back in the area!

What I tried:
- Sampler Set from Ice & Vice
- Salmon Crispy Rice and Chicken Karaage from Bessou
- Charred Steak Tacos from Alta Calidad
- Honey Chicken & Pickles Sandwich with a side of Mac & Cheese from Jacob's Pickled",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I got the lunch special from Jacob's pickles--Nashville Hot chicken that came on top of a biscuit and a drink ($13). The portions were huge! It had 4 pieces of chicken breast and two huge biscuits. It was absolutely delicious! I I also ate off some friends plates. One had the vegan ramen from Mr. Taka, and it was great! Another had a pasta from Felice, they loved it but I thought it was okay.

Time Out Market New York,"We've had our eye on this food market since it opened and since we love Dumbo, really the only area we like in Brooklyn, this was perfect. We wanted something for breakfast/lunch and initially we were going to go to Atrium, but decided against it.

The vibe and decor was great, abundant seating and everything looked consistent. I picked Avocaderia, because I wanted to feel like an Hipster, now that I discovered that I actually like avocados, I'm very late to the avo game. I picked the NY Salmon and they give you little pagers that supposed to vibrate when it's ready. It didn't. So I just watched my open avo toast sit in the open, while every person looked at it, moved my plate to check the identically other side. I didn't know it was my food. Not the happiest about that part, but what can you expect when the employees are just on their phone, texting. I watched the person put the plate down and go back to the phone. Unless the pagers are operated with your glittery phone, then you certainly didn't page me.

They do give you an abundance of avocado, more than half is definitely an understatement; they just were very stingy on the salmon. A small dab of cream cheese at the bottom and everything bagel seasoning on top. It was delicious, but not worth the $12.95 price tag. I didn't expect it to be cheaper.

My fiance went to Breads Bagelry, the bagel version of Breads Bakery. He ordered the salmon bagel and it was huge. He really liked it and it came with a super small serving of their cucumber salad, which was delicious. I can understand his costing $18.95, it was three times the size of my whimsical toast and they were not stingy with the salmon.

Besides the staff being neglectful, the place could use a bit better way of defining it layouts. It had maps of what vendors they have, but they were always behind a table where you end up staring at people while they're trying to eat. Otherwise you had to walk around the entire place to see what your options are. Hopefully they will improve that part.

We are still planning on coming back to check out the other options.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Dumbo's newest, gorgeous little tourist trap, it's a great idea with lovely interiors. The good ends there. The restaurants are interesting and diverse, but not all of them are the best in their respective cuisines even though they are priced as such... The prices and portions are insanely imbalanced, and I doubt many of the thousands of professionals in Dumbo can sustain making this a go-to lunch spot the way it's structured. Some examples-
$16 for a Breakfast Sandwich
$23 for a burger and fries
$16 for a joke of a dollop of hummus with 5 pieces of cauliflower on top

Even the nicest restaurants in Dumbo are more reasonably priced than this- and that's where I anticipate the people who drive day to day Dumbo food business will continue to take their wallets and appetites.

This place is worth stopping in for a look, as the foods are all on display, but if you want to brave the crowded lines and congested walkways for an overpriced bite of something, godspeed.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

So yeah this place isn't needed, you can find much better food, drinks and great places to relax (like Floyds) not far from here.

Time Out Market New York,"Just about how many food courts does NYC have? I've lost count but this is one to be missed
Yes it's pricey and the portions are small but the uniqueness of the vendors like Fish cheeks, Clinton st bakery and Juliana makes up for it. Some favorite dishs include Fish Cheeks marinated shrimp with 3 crab sauce. The texture was amazing and similar to sweet shrimp sashimi. The sauce was literal fire and had me sweating.
I was a bit disappointed with Bessuo's crispy rice trio offering with salmon, spicy tuna and yellowtail. The texture was great but I wish the rice was warmer!

We went to AVOCADERIA
i love avocado but the one they put on the bowl was mostly brown, not sure if it was rotten or not, so I took it all off, i was pretty hungry so i just ate everything else.  i wasn't happy.

It was pretty busy in this place and has only one set of bathrooms, which is a nightmare for women as there was a long queue and i had to wait 15 mins, maybe longer to get in there.

We went twice and I ordered:
My Thai Bowl ( i added egg instead of tofu)
Spinach, arugula, shredded cabbage, cilantro, shredded carrots, avocado, watermelon radish, spicy cashews and ginger sesame dressing

As we were heading back to Portland ME, i got a wrap to go, Ive no idea if the quac was ok or not. but it tasted pretty good.

Guacamole wrap (without chicken)
Spinach wrap, guac, spinach, shredded cabbage, cilantro, watermelon radish, carrots, roasted beets, habanero hot sauce and ginger sesame dressing.

Fries were soggy so basically the food wasn't good in my opinion.

Time Out Market New York,"Wow such a disappointment! We were visiting New York and decided to come over here from because of good things we heard.

After walking around trying to decide what to get, I settled on Alta Calidad and my girlfriend decided on   Jacob's Pickles.

I was excited to try the steak tacos because they looked delicious and the woman working recommended them. I ordered, at a modest price, and waited. Around 15 minutes went by until I realized it was taking a long time for my buzzer to go off.

I went up to the counter and noticed a plate of tacos that looked old and mushy. Luckily, that was mine!! I asked her what happened and she brushed it off quickly and said they were still hot and tasty. I slumped off.

I tried them and noticed they were room temperature. When this kind of thing happens, if it happens, I go up and say something. I went up and there was a super long line so I just sat down and ate them. The taste was good and so was the steak. Both completely broke halfway through which you can see in the picture. I would not eat here again.

My girlfriend got the chicken from Jacob's Pickle and was even less satisfied than I was. When she asked for dipping sauce she was rudely told they don't have any except for a spicy aïoli which wasn't bad. The chicken was dry and not good and the salad has a strange taste. The biscuit was very good.

Overall, not a great experience. If you're on the fence, don't go here. Instead, go to a local mom and pop restaurant as there are hundreds around here. That's what we will be doing.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

This is perfect for groups as well, as there is something for everyone including Thai, Japanese, fried chicken, Mexican, salads, desserts and so much more! Would highly recommend the Thai curry, the honey glaze fried chicken sandwich and the cookie dough.

Time Out Market New York,"Just had a very late lunch at Timeout food court in downtown Brooklyn by the waterfront :
The place is a renovated  seafront warehouse that was turned into a two level food court . They have many different varieties of food there on the first floor and on the 5th floor .
Be warned they're expensive though , you're paying for the view and the ambiance  !
Examples :
Sliders = $12
Cheese stake = $15
2 ginger ales = $12
One single personal pizza = $13
1 Jameson shot = $12
1 glass of wine = $10
So be prepared to spend !

Time Out Market New York,"The views and offerings seemed to be too hood to be true so I finally paid the market a visit on a sunny day.  A buzz with locals and tourists alike, I was saddened to enter the space without a single whiff of food.  Come to think of it, I didnt smell anything outside either. Most of the food stalls had premade things waiting to be tossed together. Just so sad, especially with all of the photos on Yelp and the gram. Two, exactly two stands had nice employees Breads bakery (bagel side) and the Avocado place next door.  They were inviting and sold me delicious things.
I was excited to see the Feed shop, and spent quite some time perusing the bags, particularly the leather ones.  Strangely enough my presence did not evoke a response of any sort, which seemed to be the only consistent thing about my visit. As I browsed, the majority of the workers looked miserable or were downright rude.  I will likely go back for those amazing Jerusalem bagels from Breads, but thIits about it.

I'm paying for drinks and you want me to go get the water while you socialize with your coworkers...uh no...I won't be going back !!! That's not the way to run a bussiness.

Time Out Market New York,"I loved my Time Out experience! I was a little nervous going there because it was just before noon on a Sunday and had read that it was going to be insane. It definitely was not (but had picked up quite a bit over the hour that we were there). It was nice to be able to browse through the stalls before choosing what to eat. I went for an old favorite - the margherita from Juliana's (no line at this one but just around the corner, they were already packed!). My niece got the chicken caesar from Jacob's Pickles and that was some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  I've been to their UWS spot but had never tried that before. I really love the selection of places represented in there as they are a lot of places I already loved and like going to and now are conveniently in one place. And the design and views can't be beat!! Can't wait to go back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Time Out Market New York,"Disappointing. I've been to the Time Out Market in Lisbon, and this one is a far cry from its European counterpart. I'm not a fan of the layout of this market, where there's seating randomly dispersed between the restaurants. I found it confusing to navigate, and difficult to find seating. The one in Lisbon has all of the restaurants around the perimeter of the space, with one central seating area in the middle. That way you can easily see which stalls you want to visit, and makes the traffic flow better.

Additionally, there's nothing new or exciting about the restaurants being featured here, as they are all existing restaurants already in New York. Sure, it's good if you want random restaurants inside a single building, but I feel that the variety of the restaurants being showcased is not wide enough. The prices are exactly the same as what they offer at their permanent restaurant locations, so it begs the question why would you come out to dumbo if you can just go to the city and eat the same food for the same price.

I sampled Mr Taka, fish cheeks, Pat LaFrieda, and Jacobs pickles. My favorite was probably the shrimp in 3 crab sauce from Fish Cheeks, as this style of Thai food is not very common in New York. This dish was spicy, sour, and savory - very well balanced with the slices of raw garlic. I had the salmon from here as well which was very spicy so beware. I found the sauce overly salty which was the main complaint.

I had the cold lemon ramen from Mr Taka which took almost 30 minutes to get, which is surprising considering It's a cold ramen. If you were to go to their actual brick and mortar location, the ramen would have taken 15 minutes at most. The ramen was good and the cold soup base was nice and sour, but the bok Choi was too big for my liking.

I tried the burger sliders from Pat LaFrieda which was surprisingly delicious, and is probably one of the better burgers I've had in New York in a while. This is a restaurant I would considering going back to- the bun was soft but crispy as well which I think perfectly contrasted the soft beef patty. Very delicious.

Jacobs pickles was disappointing, I really did not like the biscuit bun they use for the chicken. Also not a fan of white meat either. It's a big dish, but very dry.

Overall I don't see myself returning to Time Out market, as I'd rather just go to the actual restaurants if I wanted their food. The seating situation is a mess - even if you came with friends and wanted to sample all the different foods here good luck getting seats together! Some of the stalls have their own bar seating but it would be weird if you brought other food into their seating area - none of the places said anything but I don't think it should be done.

Also the bathroom situation is a mess - line for the women's bathroom was 40 people long, probably an hour wait! Going to the 5th floor won't help either as there's only 1-2 individual unisex toilets up there.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"I very much enjoyed the crispy rice trio with salmon, spicy tuna, and yellowtail from Bessou at Time Out Market. However, the market and seating were spread between the first and fifth floors, the latter being less crowded but with more expensive food options (it also features a view, though partially blocked by a bandstand stage and a bar). The weekend crowd made carrying loaded trays difficult and also led to a scarcity of seating, especially for groups of three or more. I saw quite a few people hoarding spaces even before they obtained their food (maybe a seating host could assist during busy times?). Fortunately, the tables were bussed quickly and efficiently. The line for the restroom was also quite long -- surprising for the fact that the space had two bars and a coffee shop -- though they did have an attendant assisting there. The biggest disappointment was the water filling station; it was an ice water dispenser at the front bar with a sign stating ""Please do not fill your water bottle here. Glassware is provided next to the water station. Thank You!"" Unfortunately, next to the dispenser was a stack of small, PLASTIC cups (for the environmental and financial cost of the cups, installing a water fountain with a bottle dispenser might seem the better option here). Happy to return again to support the local purveyors here, but will try to visit during off-peak times and with a full water bottle.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Time Out Market is a one-of-a-kind dining hall experience. It's like Smorgasberg and Dekalb Market Hall, but far nicer, with an outdoor roofdeck, and much nicer view. Additionally, the food is of a higher-tier.
My father and I ate at Felice, the pasta bar. We had the Spaghetti Alla Chiccaro con Pomodoro. It was ... shockingly good. Possibly the best spaghetti we've ever had. Unfortunately, the restaurant doesn't do any substitutions, but the spaghetti ended up being perfectly al dente. Highly recommended.

It was extremely crowded, and primarily with tourists. My suggestion is to go here with a date or with family, and go during the week. Monday is the least crowded.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Ambience: Another cute and laid back setting with industrial vibes. Overall very clean with some nice lighting that makes for a pleasant vibe. Not too dark either. The background music is also not too loud. The place was also great bc it doesn't get too crowded and doesn't have long lines. The bathrooms aren't as clean as you'd expect.

Comparing this to the Timeout market in Lisbon it didn't even feel like a food hall. Firstly the downstairs is cramped and dimly lit. Secondly while the food choices are pretty good, the prices are outrageous. The prices are not in line with a food hall. At those prices you may as well goto a proper restaurant and not have to carry around your own food in a plastic tray (which you paid $17+ for 2 tacos or $14 for mac cheese) . I think it's cool to check out once but don't go there for the food.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Time Out Market New York
Rating 1-10 (based on Grand Opening day)
Experience: 8.7
Food quality: 9
Pricing: 7

Time Out Market New York is a good quality experience. The staff was welcoming and polite, very accommodating when you needed anything even remedial questions they were happy to answer.  My experience with the staff at each individual restaurant was great as well, especially a young woman working the register at Pat LaFrieda. The spaces may be tight at times when navigating to get your food on the first floor but it's not so bad. Note: If you get a drink, unless you plan to drink it in that same area (upstairs or downstairs) get it in a to-go cup not a glass because you can't take them up or downstairs. But really big bonus is the rooftop experience, indoor area was very well lit, way more spacious than downstairs and the bar was better located. There is outdoor seating with a beautiful view of the bridge. If you access outside from downstairs you have access to the beautiful and cheap ($2) carousel!

The quality of the products served were excellent for the most part. We purchased two burgers (double-decker style) & a buffalo chicken sandwich from Pat LaFrieda, both of which were really good, I only wish the chicken was a thicker cut. Mac n' Cheese pasta from Jacob's Pickles was great for cheese pulling and will definitely quell your craving for Mac and cheese but I did find myself reaching for a little black pepper, but overall good! I also brought a Matcha Latte from Loco Coco with the pink pitaya milk, it was delicious omg I wish I lived local just to have that every morning but I'm also a matcha lover! Matcha may be a bit bitter if you aren't used to it but they have other options. The highlight of my day was the After School Ice Cream Sammie from Ice & Vice. An ice cream sandwich made with Mexican Brownie, malted vanilla ice cream, & a fruity pebble dusting. The brownie was structured but still soft/chewy it was just delicious.

The pricing was decent, some products were totally worth what they are priced at but most prices are understandable considering the process of preparing food and selling at a market. That said, some stuff was still overpriced, but everything I purchased I felt was worth it.  

Overall, I know I will be back very soon and often. We enjoyed ourselves very much!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Stroller accessible, high chairs, Elevators. Cons? extremely long lines at the restroom  
I think it's a very good place to eat since you seriously have a bunch of very good places just there without the horrible lines. For instance, I live in the UWS and I never get to go to Jacob's Pickles because the wait is awful. But here, it's nothing compared to that! Or Juliana's pizza! In 10' we were eating and didn't have to go thru the hustle of getting cash (Juliana's pizza in Dumbo is cash only).
Cons: the aisles can get a little busy in peak hour so, difficult to navigate.
Only 3* because at the cocktail bar, the bartender chose and added the tip to our bill! Like, seriously?! I am the one who is supposed to tap and choose which tip I want to give. That was very uncomfortable so that takes 2* from our experience. So just, check you bill and the rest, well, enjoy the food!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Time Out Market New York,"Not the best experience. The idea of it is cute, but once you get there, see all the dirty tables, all the lines, and all the people that idea goes away. We saw so many people having to clean their own tables and put the dirty dishes on other tables so that they could have a seat. There's no clear designation for dirty dishes/ trays when you're done with them so customers just end up leaving the table dirty, and there was no one cleaning them up so everything was just accumulated. Took us close to an hour to find a table (it was dirty) and close to another hour to get our food. We tried the Broccoli Gnocchi from Felice Pasta Bar and I would give that dish a 3/5. It was eh and I was still hungry after (my boyfriend couldn't finish the plate, said it was all mush). We then tried the Vegan Quesadilla from BKLYN WILD and that was a 2/5. We both couldn't finish it, it was cold when we got it despite picking it up as soon as the buzzer went off, and it was very bland. The star of the show for us was the Mac and Cheese from Jacob's Pickles. Easiest the best mac and cheese we've all had. 5/5. It was cooked perfectly, had the perfect amount of cheese, and the slightly crunchy layer on top was amazing. Apart from that, you do get a nice view of the river if you go towards the back/ the third floor, but that doesn't really outweigh the unkemptness, crowds, and eh food for me to go back when I'm in town.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Time Out Market New York,"An attractive space with a lot to be desired.

Decided to spend a beautiful Saturday sojourning to this space because I heard it's cool. It's very clean and attractive looking. Instagram models were everywhere both inside and out of the market. However, as with any NY attraction, it comes with a price.

That price being very expensive. I got chicken and mac n cheese at Jacob's Pickles and it was $29. They don't serve drinks anywhere except a bar at the very back of the market. I went and asked for a coke and the bartender seemed surprised like it didn't make sense I would want a regular drink with my meal. The Coke, in a glass with no refills, was $4.36. The food was delicious but not worth $30.

Aside from that the market was beyond crowded. There is one bathroom for men and one for women to accommodate about 300-400 people. The men's room has 1 stall and 2 urinals, which was fine. But the women's line was about 50-60 people long. NY never seems to get bathrooms right, unlike so many other cities.

The fried chicken was great and did not need the honey glaze and I would have preferred not to even have it. The biscuit for the bread was to die for, as well as   The Mac and cheese.

Since our kids wanted pizza, we stayed on the 5th floor where they have a Juliana's, a more scenic view,  indoor/outdoor rooftop seating, the TimeOut Bar and a live DJ playing some nostalgic hits. The beef burger from David Burke Tavern was also very good. For a while the 5th floor was less crowded compared to the hip trendy dark decor ground floor which has more restaurant selections but eventually we saw other guests bringing up their food in the elevator to dine in the more luminscent rooftop area.

The lines were long but flowing and the staff were very patient with everyone. From the quick glances that I made there are a good amount of vendors and a lot of unfamiliar dishes to me, with that being said I wasn't so thrilled to try much. One vendor I did try was Jacobs Pickles with their famous Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese ($15). It was good, very cheesy and creamy, good about of chicken good amount of heat. I also checked out the bar the bartender helped me out & I choose the J&G drink ($13). It has good flavors but no kick to it, lots of ice & it went down like juice. Pretty disappointing for the price. There's very little outdoor seatings but there's beautiful views out there! The rooftop also has food vendors and a bar, again on this packed evening I couldn't look around much.

Time Out Market New York,"What an great little spot in DUMBO for a stop for food if you are visiting the area, or if you are with a group of friends wanting to step in for lunch or so!
We came in with a group of 6-8 and had no problem finding a table for all of us. There is also seating outside and a gorgeous view of the bridge.  I would say definitely pick what you want to eat before sitting down because the lines can get pretty long during peak hours. You also can't bring trays from other floors, meaning if you purchase food downstairs, you will have to bring it upstairs as 'to go'. We had the lox bagel, which is pricey but you get an insane amount of food, and it looks interesting! The food options are pretty diverse and the cocktail/ wine selection at the bar is also pretty varied. Again, this is a 'trendy' location right in DUMBO, so expect to spend a few dollars on each item. Great overall, and definitely a summer staple!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Time Out Market New York,"Beautifully designed and a ton of fun. This place is the Chelsea market of Dumbo, although a little smaller. There are maybe 20-30 different vendors with some amazing options. Prices are about $15-20 for a meal which is honestly pretty normal for NYC. I came on a Saturday at noon so it was quite packed but we didn't have any trouble finding seating, although I heard that the bathroom lines were ridiculous. Clinton Street's pancakes are about the best I've ever had, and it's a great place for families, to bring someone from out of town, or just to hang out with friends or casually with a S/O. Would definitely come back to try more options!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Time Out Market New York,"The Time Out Market in DUMBO has excellent atmosphere. However, the restaurants here are ALL dreadfully  over-priced and not at all satisfying. This was very disappointing as I was so pleased when I learned that a food court would open in this architecturally wonderful site!

My experience with the Center Cut Deli was instructive.
I entered Time Out Market with a great craving for Pastrami and decided, quite indulgently and much against my usual better judgement to pay the $19.95.

I asked for Rye bread with Caraway seeds, the dolt working there had no idea what caraway seeds were- a very bad sign. I settled on plain rye. He brought me a blend of mediocre rye swirled with pumpernickel.

I like my coleslaw on the side. They put some cole slaw upon my sandwich without asking me. This was dumb! The quarter slice pickle was quite skimpy and pathetic- just one!

The portion of okay Pastrami, was certainly
not what a deli might describe as overstuffed. This  pastrami sandwich was most definitely NOT worth the price. There was no mustard in sight to be found-- fortunately mustard was available- obtaining some, resembled the process of making a special order.

The most irritating aspect of Center Cut: the impossibility of using  cash. This appears to be the policy of other similarly overpriced restaurants at Time Out Market.
Such places should be boycotted by all thoughtful citizens.

The aforementioned dolt who served me this most disappointing sandwich carefully watched me as I decided NOT to include a tip. After all, no waiter service had been provided. I was done being a chump. Tip percentage options were too high as well. Had I been suckered into it clicking the tip option as I used my credit card, the total cost of this measly pastrami sandwich would have been $25.00.

Still, the character that served me had the gall to say, while hovering over me: NO TIP? I didn't bother to answer him.

I will not return to this ridiculously over-priced rip-off joint and am unlikely to patronize other Time Out Market restaurants as well.

While Center Cut is attractive in its appearance, it is most definitely NOT the sort of place any savvy New Yorker would or should ever care to patronize. Only clueless tourists will help it to survive. This place does not deserve to survive.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Time Out Market New York,"I went on a Saturday night ( 2nd day of opening) around 8pm and it was crowded but we still managed to find seats. I ate at Bessou which had higher end prices. The staff was very attentive in clearing plates and making sure tables were clean. As for drinks, it was hard for me to find stalls that sold non-alcoholic drinks so be sure to bring you own drinks. After a nice meal, be sure to make your way to the rooftop for an amazing view of all three bridges.

Time Out Market New York,"This is a review of Pat La Frieda in the Time Out Market in DUMBO. My wife and I came here at 5PM on a Saturday. We had eaten once before when the Time Out NY Market had just opened. At that time, the entire market was packed and there were long lines at every restaurant. We ate at Pat La Frieda then and loved the Chicken and Steak Philly Cheesesteaks there as well as the sweet potato tater tots.

We then came back to Pat La Frieda in the Time Out NY Market last weekend (early September). At this hour there was no crowd and no lines to order. We ordered the exact same food and it took more than 40 minutes for our to be served. While I can live with delays, the staff was incredibly rude. In addition, we learned that the delay was due to the Chicken for the Chicken Cheesesteak being held up. That was ok but the other food was prepared and sitting there in our views getting cold and not being served to us. When I pointed that out to the staff I was ignored and the waittress rolled her eyes and turned her back to me. I have never been treated so rudely in a restaurant in my life.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The market is great, we live 5 minutes away, and the food and upstairs bar have been awesome, we go several times a week. However, the downstairs bar we have tried to enjoy several times, to be greeted with rude service, and extremely grumpy bartenders. I understand it can get frustrating having tourists come by a lot, but that is no excuse to have lower service, especially when a glass of wine is $12+. This evening the woman was particularly bad. We stood at the bar for no less than 5 minutes (there was no one else to serve) while she played on her phone, to finally be greeted with disdain that we were there and interrupting her instagramming.

There was very little crab for the price. Chicken wings was just okay. This was disappointing because we actually love the Fish Cheeks restaurant in Manhattan. Beef udon from Bessou was nothing special for the price and the portion was rather small. The soup was very oily. The mixed green salad from Center Cut with honey mustard sauce was delicious but still overpriced in my opinion.

Stunning during the day light hrs from every angle (May to choose from), so I can only imagine when the sun goes down just how much more breathtaking it all becomes. Food was okay, drinks was okay, but within the vicinity of Dumbo it's self you have many options for food, drinks and views that it's literally a win win.  Also, it's pricey $$$, but that generally comes with the territory of being in any prime location. Your are really paying for the rarity, exclusiveness and the poss. It's a kid friendly, tourists and social type environment mid morning- early evening for sure. I will def return when the sun is going down and explore again, because I have a feeling the entire scene changes at night. This place also has a market on the ground level and pretty much takes a full block around. Lots of twists and turn to explore. I'd say check it out for yourself.

Time Out Market New York,"I really wanted to like this place.  I REALLY did.  But, I think it is rather pricey for the very moderate portions.  If they shaved about $4-5 off each entree, it would be a decent value.

The service for the ramen I purchased was decent, but I was almost done with my soup by the time my sister received her chicken and waffle entree.  And they forgot to give her the maple syrup so she had to go back!  I realize we visited about a week after the opening, so hopefully places will improve as they work out the kinks.

The biggest kicker to our experience was going to use the restrooms after we ate.  There were about 12-15 women in line outside the restroom waiting (and I don't know how many inside that I couldn't see)!!!!  And this wasn't even during prime time (lunch hour)!  Seriously, how could the restrooms have been so poorly planned, in this day and age, that there were so many women waiting (remember TIMEOUT just opened a week prior to our visit)?

I was looking for something lite, I usually have a cup of coffee and a bar but Jacob's Pickles has a sign touting a Caesar Salad topped with their incredible chicken. My compadres, one went the ramen route and the other ordered from Jacob's Pickles but got a massive cheese smothered chicken.

These days, at any high end food court, customers are expecting quality and Jacob's Pickles delivers. Their chicken is reeeeeeally good! Hot, juicy and has a nice crunchy exterior. This was the Ying to my salads Yang. Excellent lunch choice for me today, filling and satisfying.

There are lots of amazing choices, Honey Chicken and Pickles, Nashville Hot chicken along with some amazing homemade biscuits.

Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"I live about 15 min walk away but I never really venture towards Dumbo because of all the tourists. But the girlfriend wanted to visit Time Out Market just because she wanted to try the chicken sandwich here.

We got here around 10:50 and waited around til 11, and let me tell you, Best. Decision. Ever.

First off, the chicken was fried to perfection. I've fried a lot of chicken in my time so when the chicken comes out golden, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, I know they did an amazing job with clean oil. (IYKYK) It was breaded perfectly and the seasoning was spot on.

We got the sausage gravy smothered chicken and it was a LOT of food. Plus a drink for only $12!!! It's a lunch special they have from 11-2.

And the service, the service was great! You'd think because of the concept, they're used to seeing a lot of tourists and getting a lot of people every day wears you down. But the guy that served us was really nice, constantly asked us how we liked the food while we ate at the bar, and even gave us some pickles to try saying that they were his favorite and he eats them every day.

The pickles were a fantastic addition to the chicken, and next time I will be ordering a side of pickles from the get go.

All in all, I think I've found my new favorite brunch place on my off days. 10/10 would recommend.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-time-out-market-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

I'm not from the area so I had no idea their fried chicken was famous but just walking by it I was captivated by its crunchy exterior. Many passerby could be seen taking pictures.

We opted for their fried chicken & pickles with a biscuit and honey glaze. Chicken was super fresh, juicy, and tender. I loved the crunch that comes with each bite. Biscuit was light and airy and pairs well with the honey glaze. The entire dish overall had a nice balance of savory, sweet, tangy, and sour. We only ordered one plate, and that was enough to feed two people.

Also loved the hip yet moody atmosphere of the market. Reminds me a lot of the Pine Street Market we have at home in Portland.

Definitely a go to spot in the DUMBO area.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-time-out-market-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"Lisa E. said .........I've been dreaming of the chicken sandwich from Jacob's at the Time Out Market - you have to try it!  So, Sunday we travelled into Brooklyn, the place of my birth, a borough I don't visit often enough. Arriving just before 11AM, the market was just barely coming alive. Lisa and my daughter order a sandwich to share, while I hold tight to a nicely situated table. They come back to the table and I get a chance to walk around and take it all in. I walk past Jacob's just as the sandwich is done, grab it, take a beautiful photo with the stall in the background. I bring it to the table with three set ups and hear an ohhhhhhh.... this is for me and Mele, none for you!!!! I head back around all the stalls and nothing catches my eye like that sandwich did. I upped the game and ordered the Nashville Hot. Honestly, one bite in and I'm totally blown away by this!!! Crispy tender fried chicken, tender biscuit, savory pickles. I relished each bite, cutting morsels and dragging them through the buttery honey spicy sauce. Pure bliss!!

Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"If you follow the hype train to Brooklyn, it will surely lead you to the time out market in DUMBO. I've always seen friends eat here and I never understood the hype. All I can really say is that I cannot believe that it has taken me this long to experience this fried chicken sandwich. If you thought that the fried chicken sandwich hype ended between Popeye's and Chick Fil A, you are wrong. This sandwich takes the biscuit for sure! I tried the honey fried chicken sandwich and I am devouring each bite of it (and for the bites that I am unable to finish - saving it for later). Delicious is not even close enough in describing this sandwich.

Word to the wise - if you're not a big eater, find a friend that loves fried chicken as much as you & opt for sharing a sandwich because the portions are huge!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-time-out-market-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"I went to Jacob's Pickles in Timeout Market around 7 pm on a Saturday. The line probably took 10 minutes to order, and we received our food within 10 minutes of ordering. Given it was a Saturday night, we were lucky to find counter seats right in front of Jacob's Pickles.

We order the Hot Chicken Sandwich with Classic Mac and Cheese and the Fried Pickles. Compared to the Upper West Side location, the quality of food is nearly identical. The perks of coming to Time Out markets are (A) you don't have to wait an hour for a table, (B) the prices are slightly lower, and (C) they allow you to get a combo of the Mac and Cheese with the sandwich (in my opinion, the full size is a little large if you want a sandwich too so I greatly appreciate the combo option).

Overall good experience and food, and would highly recommend if you want to try Jacob's Pickles/are craving it but don't want to brave the waits at the Upper West Side location.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-time-out-market-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"Very good chicken.  Delicious pickles.  Not a huge fan of the biscuits.  I got the friend chicken sandwich on a biscuit with honey and pickles.  The chicken was phenomenal - great texture and taste.  The pickles were great too - sweet, crisp, everything you want in a pickle.  I was disappointed by the sauce and the biscuit.  The sauce was literally just pure honey, which maybe I should have expected, but it was surprising and way too sweet.  The biscuit didn't have any texture.  It didn't seem buttery or fluffy or chewy... it was just a thin piece of flaky bread soaked in honey.  Not a huge fan, but I would definitely still come back here for the chicken!

Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"Visited Time Out Market yesterday and decided to get Jacob's Pickles. I ordered the Honey Biscuit Chicken Sandwich.

It was monstrous, lol! Two slices of biscuit, two huge pieces of fried chicken, and a stack of homemade pickles topped all with honey.

The amount of pickles were a lot as well as the amount of honey. I love pickles but I feel like they over did it with them and with so much honey, the bread became soggy. If you have a sweet tooth and dont mind using a fork and knife for this ""sandwich"" then this is for you. It was good but since I'm not too much into sweets it got a little much towards the end, BUT I will say that the chicken was beautifully coated and fried, had lots of flavor so I would come back again to try their other options.

We had: fried pickles, southern fried chicken cesar salad, Nashville hot chicken sandwich and mac & cheese. The portions were huge. Each meal could have easily been split between two people, but of course we wanted to try a variety of things! Everything was hearty, filling and full of calories. I love fried pickles, but I did not prefer their version so I probably wouldn't order those again. A little pricey for the portion size too. I'd also ask for less dressing or dressing on the side of my salad--again just personal preference. All of the chicken was cooked and seasoned deliciously. The side portion of the classic mac & cheese (yummmm!) was enough for a full meal by itself. Can't forget the melt in your mouth biscuits either!

Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"Normally I won't say anything about someone else's review, but the fact that dude got a salad at this spot and gave a bad review has me DYING.

When I went with the family(and ordered the RIGHT THING) I was pretty blown away. The portions, the plating, the flavors, every part of this experience was over the top, you could almost say fun.

We had tried the staple. CHICKEN & PICKLES. And of course, a very soft, warm biscuit that was like getting home in the winter and just taking off your northface. This followed by spicy-ish honey that was drizzled down the mountain of chicken and pickles. The chicken,the star over the show was juicy crispy goodness. To have so much, you end up trying it with the biscuit, then chicken biscuit honey, then chicken pickle, and on and on. They deliver you an experience all around. We had also tried the chicken and gravy in which my concern is always, ""is this real gravy or watery BS"". Their gravy is certified goodness.

I have to give props to the macaroni as well I am a hard judge on macaroni and they bring it to life with gooey sharp goodness. Side note, if you hate macaroni and cheese with any other noodle like I do, try this anyway, it will be worth it.

My only issue with this place, aside from not having it on my block, is for the same reason I complimented it - the portion sizes are huge. We were caught off guard by how much two of their plates could feed four people and we were stuffed. I think they could do very well with reducing the portion size,while only reducing price a little, or introduce the plates as family size plates, because my family was FED.

Love this place, will return again, NO question.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-time-out-market-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

I couldn't even see my chicken, but it was definitely there. Two giant cutlets, in fact. It's definitely a knife-and-fork sandwich, unless you don't care about what you're wearing.

Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"Went to see a show at St. Ann's Warehouse and decided to check out the Time Out Market next door. Reviews for Jacob's Pickles seemed good, so I thought, ""Why not?"" Ordered the Honey Chicken and Pickles Biscuit with a side of Mac and Cheese. Amazing!  The chicken was so flavorful and crisp - perfectly seasoned. The honey and biscuit added a luxuriousness to the dish. Mac and cheese was thick and creamy and just full of flavor. There's no way I could eat it all.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-time-out-market-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"I've been to the Time Out Market before but this was my first time trying out Jacob's Pickles. I was in the mood for some fried chicken so I got their Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich which was *AMAZING*. Had a good amount of kick to it with a generous heap of pickles on top. The chicken was still crunchy & oh so flavorful. That, with the biscuit, was to die for. Definitely recommend this joint if you're in the area!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-time-out-market-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"bought the honey chicken combo with the fried Oreo dessert ... The chicken sandwich was ok, think the honey poured onto the plate was a bit much and over kill . A bit too sweet for the meal .... I have to say that the pickles was pretty good with a kick of spicy and sour. However, after a while the over powering sweetness  of the honey and the sour of the pickle clashs and makes the meal unbearable to eat.
The fried Oreo was pretty good .",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-time-out-market-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"I stopped by in Time Out Market for lunch and I was definitely looking to try a lot of different food. This place was slightly disappointing. I ordered the fried chicken caesar salad special, maybe I should have stuck to the tried and true here. The salad was waaay overdressed and was way too much. There were tough stalk parts of the lettuce also which I did not want to eat. The fried chicken was also just ok, the breading was almost thicker than the meat and was on the bland side. Not really sure where all the great reviews come from",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacobs-pickles-time-out-market-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"If you don't want to wait in line for the famed Jacobs Pickles on the Upper West Side, then this is a good alternative. I'm still blown away by the amount of delicious food you get for the price you pay. Only $13 for the Honey & Pickle Fried Chicken Sandwich. It will give you plenty of leftovers or is perfect to share! The chicken is always fabulous. Not too fried and always tender. The biscuit is to die for. Cakey and so good. The honey paired so perfectly with the chicken and pickles. Although they have a more limited menu, it's worth it to go if you don't want to wait the line. Love Jacob's Pickles!

Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,We passed by this stand inside the Timeout Market. Saw fried pickles on the menu and decided to stop. The fried pickles were good but portions are small. Decided to order the Nashville chicken as well and the portions was decent but was drenched in oil.

Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"What are ARTERIES?!

Jacob's Pickles is definitely clogging up those boys. I absolutely would recommend this place 10/10. I ordered the honey chicken with pickles on a biscuit.

Pro Tip: Ask for the honey on the side. This will ensure that our chicken does not get soggy when you're waiting to get a table. It will take a while if you want a seat outside on the rooftop.

Jacob's Pickles Time Out Market,"Upfront.  I have never eaten at Mercado Little Spain.  However, as soon as we are allowed to travel and I am able to get to New York City, I will be eating at Mercado Little Spain.
 
I am writing this because actually eating at a restaurant isn't everything.  That seems peculiar for a posting on YELP.  But, I want to call attention to Chef José Andrés and his organization World Central Kitchen.  

WCK is on a mission to make sure everyone has a fresh, warm meal in times of crisis. And, CWK has responded to a number of crisis-earthquakes in Puerto Rico, wildfires in California and many more.  Now, CWK is responding to the food crisis as a result of Coronavirus.  They are delivering fresh meals, putting restaurants back to work, feeding frontline healthcare workers, etc.

Mercado Little Spain,"***Pre-COVID*** Fun little culinary adventure that is steps away from the Vessel. It kiiiind of feels like a large cafeteria, expcept everything is upscale and costs a lot more. We got a smattering of different foods to try between the five of us - some paella from the paella stand (delish, would recommend), the patates from the patates stand (these were alright, would not recommend unless you love this specific type of food); sangria (we got the white; HIGHLY recommend, it's deliciousssss). We were unable to find seating and thus stood around a standing table to eat, which suited us just fine. Definitely can find something for everyone here!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I am not a fan of Spanish food.  I don't see the big deal with it.  It doesn't impress me.  

So why the 4 stars?  I like that it exists.  I like the level of attention to detail in every aspect of the place to be true to Spanish cuisine.  This place not only feeds, but it also educates people on the variety of Spanish food that come from different parts of the country.  You also learn a little bit about Spain and Spanish culture itself.  Often overshadowed by it's 800-pound gorilla culinary cousin, Italy, you come to learn about their rich history and that it is a lot more than tapas, rioja and bull fighting.  

I often bring people here from out of town and they are wowed by the place. Mercado is more than a meal, it is a cultural experience.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Really high quality food, just wish the menus were a little more extensive. Their selection of cured meats and cheeses is alone worth checking out (the bartender at Bar Celona gave incredible recommendations), but the tapas at the wine bar is great too.

The place can be packed on the weekends, so I'd suggest coming on week nights.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"With the opening of Hudson Yards last year a ton of new businesses and restaurants also popped up that are prime for exploring. Given that, there might not be a better embodiment of all the types of foods offered in this new west side mecca than Mercado Little Spain. Albeit, the food selection is mainly Spanish, but the different things you're able to try in the confines of this market is impressive. My girlfriend and I found ourselves here on a  Saturday morning while strolling the high line. We wanted a snack and knew we'd find something we both liked within this Spanish inspired market.

After walking in you're immersed with either a new bar or booth at almost every turn. The space is decorated with a modern feel, but allows each booth to create and showcase it's own environment behind their counter. There are spots solely dedicated to seafood, meats, cheeses, and others where you're able to grab unique wines as well.

We decided to go with a booth that specialized in French inspired ""jambon"" sandwiches. We recently took a trip to France and loved how they made these types of sandwiches. We were curious to find out what the Spanish equivalent was and were surprised to see it when it came out.

The sandwich itself was really thin, but was still was packed with quality sliced meats and tasty cheese. The bread was also toasty so after the first bite you got a great crunch followed by nicely melted and mixed cheese and meat. The sandwich came out to be $16 which was a little steep given the quantity, but it most likely represents the quality of ingredients that were used.

Overall this market is ideal for visiting with friends or grabbing something new if you're exploring the Hudson Yards area. You can dine, snack, and drink here so it's great for almost any occasion!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Picked up sandwiches at Mercado Little Spain for lunch with friends.  The pork and cheese sandwich is delicious. Biked up to the window and ordered - quick, easy, friendly. Touchless payment. Didn't wait long and we were ready to go for a picnic in the shadow of the Vessel.  Fun lunch.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I cannot say enough good things about this place! I came here while exploring NYC solo on a cold and snowy day. I came in on a Monday afternoon and it was definitely crowded and seating was a little sparse. They do have cocktail tables which is convenient while waiting for your food but I found it uncomfortable to eat my food at those tables. That being said, the staff at all of the little booths were so helpful and gave great suggestions on what to try!

I ended up getting the flatbread (not sure what the official name is) which was soo delicious. I expected it to be similar to pizza but the texture and spices used made it 20x better. I also got a churro from one of the dessert booths and it was one of the best churro's I have had!

Overall if I am ever in NYC again, I will definitely be back for the variety of foods and location!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Not sure what all the hate for Mercado Little Spain is all about. The comparison with Eataly is apt, even if there's relatively more emphasis on eating on-site and less on carry-away groceries.

Sure, things might be pricey and they might not be as authentic as something eaten on site in Spain, but especially for the uninitiated, this is a great way to sample a lot of things at once, whether cocas (similar to flatbreads), tortillas de patatas (sort of like potato-egg frittatas), empanadas, paella, or more. And it's best done with a small group so you can tag-team among different kiosks and get some quick bites on the go.

If you want something more substantial, there are also sit-down bars and dining areas which I didn't try. These appeared to emphasize eating and drinking within their confined areas as opposed to getting your grub and drink to go.

Still, overall, this is a pleasant food court where you can learn more about different aspects of Spanish cuisine all in one place. And it provides an extra reason to visit the shops here at Hudson Yards besides a visit to the Vessel.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"TLDR: Eataly meets Spain. Imagine a food hall but with all Spanish food. Lots of tapas, small bites, etc. Not a bad place to go with friends but just go knowing you're paying for the variety and the environment, not really the food itself.

I really really wanted to like this place. The concept makes so much sense, it should be like a food hall but awesome. So similar to Eataly, there are a lot of different stations where you can try different options. I love this kind of format, I had a great time at Dekalb Food Hall last time I went.

It has been on my list since I heard they were opening so when I finally was going - I was super excited. We went on a Friday night and I had mentally prepared myself for the crowds. Surprisingly when we went in, it was relatively light; much more than you'd expect on a Friday night.

First stop was the counter with the patatas bravas and churros. About $20 we finally dig in to our first stop on this night of food. The potatoes fell quite dull for me, the pimenton sauce was bland and the aioli was a bit too much. They were not the crispy Spanish small bite I've become accustomed too. A dry, starchy cube of potato. Similar to the home fries on a plate of a eggs at an overpriced hotel. The churros tasted a bit greasy but otherwise acceptable. The chocolate sauce was like $5. So 50/50 at this one.

Next stop was the paella station. The paella is pre-made and is in this massive pan. They have the chicken/rabbit and just vegetable. No seafood option, just those two. They scoop it out of this pan onto a plate, I have no idea how long it's been out there. $17 for this. We go to the table to try it, it's incredibly oily and barely warm. The warmth of a dish when you make a half-hearted attempt to reheat food in the middle of the night. There is no socarrat, nothing to remind me of that crispy edge that's practically the whole point of paella.

We go to one last counter to try an empanada. Not too bad, wasn't what I was expecting. The roast pork was surprisingly sweet, it did not strike me as Spanish. It tasted almost like Chinese roast pork but in a puff pastry. Not the worst idea, I guess.

I feel so disappointed at this point, we're about to leave but ultimately ended up trying one of the actual restaurants in Mercado. Thankfully that meal was decent or I'm not sure if I'd ever come back here.

It's a shame because there's so much opportunity here. I just personally felt there was no passion in any of the food. It tasted exactly like what it is, mass-produced paella/tapas for whoever wants to go on a food crawl in Mercado.

I'd come back with friends maybe to give it one more shot but I'd definitely lower my expectations quite a bit.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"This place is so worth it. Yes it gets crowded and the space is small but the quality of food in this mass production was incredible!!
You have the freedom to piece together a full meal from a bunch of small plate stands.
We scoped everything out before we decided to order. This would be harder to navigate with a larger group but definitely doable if you are willing to be patient.
We started with the meat paella which was SO GOOD. And a hearty plate compared to some of the other small plates. It was seasoned well and cooked to perfection. We then got a charcuterie board with melt in your mouth prosciutto. That they cut right in front of you off incredible pigs.
Be aware: the cocktails are a little pricey but it is Hudson Yards so I do expect to pay more. The convenient wine cart off to the side of the bar served $18 glasses of champagne.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"So I really really really enjoy the esthetic of this place and the vibe here. Only mistake was bringing kids, well I should say brining MY kids lol we had to dance battle another family for a table because my kids couldn't reach the bar height tables. I got the pulpo, which was amazing, and the chicken paella (pass). My kids got pizza opps I'm sorry I mean cocas and that was really really good too. We were still hungry so we also got a steak sandwich which was just ok.to wash everything down we got a dozen churros which were just ehhh.

Overall this place looks cool af but for me missed the mark on some of the food. Granted I didn't get everything but out of all the food I ordered the pulpo and the cocas were the only notable dishes. I would love to see more places like this pop up. Salud!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I love Jose Andres and this is a neat venture.
Went on a Sunday. Was a little too crowded to really enjoy the concept. Not a table in sight and it was a little confusing on how to get a seat and/or service.
We finally snagged a single seat at the bar (for two of us) and ate standing up after ordering a couple of sandwiches and a pizza.  The sandwiches were very good (though wait to order was long), the pizza was terrible and was donated.
I wish I had known how to navigate this before going, as I think I would have enjoyed more.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"For me, Mercado Little Spain is the only reason to venture to Hudson Yards.  This food hall, buried in the ground floor corner of this mammoth development, holds all the joy, conviviality, and excitement that is missing everywhere else.

While it can be pricey, there are food options here that won't leave you penniless.  I tried a horchata -- one of my favorite drinks -- and the stand that serves them here makes one of the best I've ever had.  That's just one example of the quality that surrounds you when venture inside.

My only question: why didn't they just put Jose Andres in charge of all of Hudson Yards?  I think he may be the only person who could bring life to the rest of this sleepy mall.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

It's not quite as glamorous and wonderful as I want it to be-  I picture more magic and warmth but ya know... it's a food court under a mall so, what could anyone want more?

I'd definitely go back and spend boatloads though, don't get me wrong-",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"After attending an Yelp elite event here I decided to come check out this place out on its own.
First up drinks, we got some wine from the Vino place lorddd 2 small ass glasses was $30 wtf? I mean gesshh for that buy your self a bottle & bring it over!! Slow service here too not worth the price tag for the wine.
Next we had a sandwich from Bocatas & empanadas we had the ham & cheese one , yumm nice buttery taste, toasted & cost less than the glass of wine I believe it was $12-13.
Our last stop was La Barra, seating is a bit of a hot mess u can't just sit down u need to see the hostess walking around.. once seated we started with some Beer not bad nice & cold big glass too it was good.
On the food we had the croquettes, very small dish just 2 to try , they were good, the spicy chorizo wrapped in potatoes chips it seems were not bad a little spicy & then the chicken skewers very good, great tasting bread wit it.
Not sure what I was expecting from this market? It wasn't that impressive in the end service is a bit chaotic, prices are on the expensive side especially for what u get.
Best thing here is the location, nice area to explore the mall itself it mainly about some high end shopping  ..overall not terrible if u r in the area & just want to kill some time checking it out.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"The decor is impecable and very attracting; however, the food quality does not match this at all. The place is very clean and everything looks organized and presentable.

The main attraction should be the food and this is where they fail. We sat down at the restaurant inside called ""Leña"". The food was not hot (warm at its best), it didn't have a lot of seasoning and the portions were really small. The tortilla and ""truffle paella"" were very small compared with their prices.

I ordered the skirt steak at $21 and the portion was very small. The meat had no seasoning and it tasted like ""liver"". I would only return for drinks and churros, but definitely not worth it for food options",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Came here because we were in the Hudson Yards area and it intrigued us from the outside. Definitely gave us a ""Spanish version of Little Italy"" vibe, though less grocery store and more food hall.

It was fun wandering around and seeing all the different counters, though the prices were fairly steep. I ended up going to the gazpaco kiosk and getting a gazpacho with jamon serrano and a hard-boiled egg, while my two friends went to the coca kiosk and each got a coca: one with jamon iberico and cheese, and another with grilled vegetables. Coca's a type of flatbread, and decidedly not a pizza, which the peppy boxes that the cocas came in the heavily reiterate.

I liked the gazpacho I got well enough, though wasn't sure it was worth it for the price. The coca with the jamon iberico was definitely my favorite, though I think I'm just a sucker for jamon. Overall, an interesting place to wander into when we were hungry for dinner, but leans too pricey for my taste.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I know the chef who owns this place. As a matter of fact I like José Andrés' way of cooking and his philanthropic moves. But out of all the stations in his Hudson Yards baby, who's actually cooking? The flavors are distinct- but they're mass produced, mass produced, mass produced!

Mercado Little Spain has been undoubtedly on our radar for a visit- and for a gorgeous Sunday late afternoon, Mercado wasn't crowded. Stations are each designed with their own flair and each working up their 'specialty'. But the further in you walked, the area feels closed in. I know I walked into the first floor, but it feels like the basement. Am I under the High Line? Or one of the Hudson Yards buildings?

Some stations- you couldn't even bring food 'out' to eat in the common seating areas- and had to eat at that specific restaurant. 'La Barra' is one of those restaurants where you HAD to sit at their station. When the server noticed I was sitting away from her restaurant, she explained she could get in trouble for bringing food away from her spot. In the end she gave in. Food? I know things shift- I get it- and food never tastes the same- but this is Spanish (Spain) food that's just way off. The Paella station had only but 2 to choose from: Vegetarian or Chicken-Rabbit. What's that??? And no seafood Paella.

It has a food court feel- BUT...I can get better and upscale food at The Westchester in White Plains! Plus food here isn't out of this world. Did I feel like I was in Spain? I don't know... you tell me. But I hope that you will enjoy your choices as much as we did. But in Mercado's defense, you can go from station to station to eat bits and pieces from each restaurant and service was nice. But honestly, we didn't find the unexpected and we weren't delighted by this place. Listen...this is a nice Spanish-focused concept....for tourists- not for me. World Famous, Michelin Star Chef José Andrés- just put his stamp, his face and money into Mercado Little Spain...and that's great! I really wanted to jive with Mercado- but there are better Spanish restaurants in the city!

And please Milena- do not respond to my review with Mercado's generic comment. Better yet- do not respond. Gracias!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I really wanted to like this place. I love Chef Andres and the things he does for communities after natural disasters. But the food here was nothing to rave about.
We had reservation to Mar and thought why not walk around and try a few things instead. Cancelled our reservations and walked around before deciding on what to eat.I mean the whole feeling of being at the Mercado is what I really wanted to experience. I ordered the octopus and my husband an empanada. The octopus was meh. Nothing crazy just tasted like lots of olive oil and paprika. The empanada was nothing to talk about it. Pricey food for ok flavor. For those that are comparing this to Eately I think the quality and value needs to be reconsidered when comparing.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Unexpectedly enjoyed this place. The entire basement  floor of Hudson yards mall  is a Spanish themed  restaurants, market stalls, sit down eateries , tapas bars etc that is equivalent to the Spanish version of Little Italy.

There is a half hour to 45 minutes waiting time for the sit down  restaurant so we went for the to the food kiosk , eat on the bistro style stand at your own risk tables.  After few minutes, we get lucky to grab regular table with chairs nearby.

We went for  the Spanish seafood paella for entree, matched with Spanish sparkling  wine version drinks and their Spanish pastries/ coffee  for dessert. It is pricey  but the taste of each kind was a treat.

The place has happy ambiance and the Spanish feels with its decor, music and the crowds. It gives me an excitement feeling to look forward for our Spain  tour this spring.  

On my last two visits in the Hudson yards Mall, we tried it's restaurants    upstairs. I enjoyed the casual vibes of Mercado. I heard that it opens at 5pm till 11 pm everyday. Consider on your visit.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Mercado Little Spain,"Jose Andrés: your employees at this place and the people managing it are going to ruin your business.
Te lo digo en serio, el servicio al cliente es deficitario! Los empleados poco eficientes, se les ve perdidos y sin ganas de trabajar. Si entramos en el tema de cómo está todo montado,... creo que los precios no se adecúan a todo el esfuerzo que el cliente tiene que hacer para comer.

See below a couple of examples of my experience of TODAY's visit

The Diner: it didn't had any draft beer (they had issues with the barrels) on Friday at 5PM. Last time I tried to had something there we waited until someone said that at the bar is first come first serve, we sit for more than 10 min with the barman in front of us and not offering even the menu and left. I am starting to wonder if this place is cursed for us... wait, only been once with work peers for a sangria which was ok.

Pasteleria: you order and instead of serving you what you've ordered, the person at the counter takes another order leaving no clue if there will be someone else giving you your order or what (while worker #2 is just looking around and there are 2 more seeming busy but not attending anyone). Palmera de chocolate, delicious.

The Bread and empanada station: 3 people in with no customer except us. We ordered a bred to go. They ran out of ""wrapping paper"" and it seems that no other options were available at the station. One of the 3 employees then went to ""the kiosk"" (literally 1 min walk) from the station for more paper. But do you know what?  We had to wait 10min to get our bread.
How is that possible? you would wonder...
1. Paper came and they did not start wrapping the bread, they were losing time.
2. They wrapped it as it was a Xmas gift. Paper, tape... FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!! It is one $4 bread, that you just buy and go with it! You guys just need a paper slip bag.
3. Could be the late afternoon shift employees? Because at lunch time they were super efficient one day I ordered sandwich...

This is not the first time that we have this kind of issues.

SERVICE WILL KILL THIS PLACE. Slow, not engaged at all, they don't give a s**t. Spanish people working there are quite condescendent.

The ONLY REASON WHY I GO HERE IS BECAUSE THE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD. I've tried La Mar, La Barra, la Granja, Churros, Bravas, Empanadas y bocatas, Pasteleria,... I work at the building upstairs!
But never in the mood of buying expensive food in poor presentation (paella at $17 on a paper plate?), look for tables, chairs,... too miserable for that price

The place is nicely decorated with hints of Mediterranean vibes and also South of Spain.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I ditto all the comparisons to Eataly - this feels like a Spanish version! I ordered the patatas bravas, jamon and cheese bocata, and an order of churros with chocolate. The food was absolutely delicious. I'd recommend getting the patatas bravas with the aioli. The churros with chocolate are a great treat but also very sweet.

While the food is delicious, it's also incredibly expensive. A small soda is $4, so I'd save this place for a special occasion.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Unexpected treasure in Hudson Yards! I got lost when I got to this place and went to the actual restaurant, but the real experience is on the bottom floor with the food court. I tried the Pan con Tomate and the Spicy Fried Potatoes. The Pan con Tomate is exactly what it is. Tomato on bread with some salt and oil. It sounds very simple but it was delicious and cheap too! The Spicy Fried Potatoes were pretty expensive and honestly I will try something else next time because they were just okay.
My friends also had the churro and ice cream, both of which were hits. I can't wait to come back here and try new things available.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I really wanted to love this place. The concept is brilliant and Spanish food is amazing. But in reality, this was just kind of off or maybe my expectations were too high?
We got churros to share - they were good but not great. Certainly not as good as what we had at a hole in the wall in Barcelona a few months ago. We also wanted to try the paella, but when we got there they told us the wait was 30 minutes. The operation is really weird....there are clearly multiple burners, why would you wait until the existing paella (a large pan nonetheless) is completely depleted until you START making the next one?! It's like 4pm and you are nowhere near closing! Also there were only two kinds of paella available, Valencia and vegetarian. That's kinda disappointing.
Anyway we were not going to wait 30 min so we never tried the paella - maybe it's out of this world amazing? Maybe not? Overall...meh.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Had some expectations based on the nyt review but should have believed the yelp reviews.. it was the definition of a tourist trap and even worse than eataly -- at least at eataly although the food is expensive its quite good and sufficient. Our group of four got so many dishes but still left unsatisfied with quite a significant spend.

My 3stars are reserved for places i didnt care for but would go if someone really wanted to, but this was a place i would actively discourage someone to go to if they wanted to.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

I went straight to the sweets section to which I ordered the simple flan and a couple of the brass de Mercedes rolls
o also tried the churros with Choco syrup which is good and fresh since I had to wait for it.
it was a little confusing where to get and buy the other stuff but I guess it's because it's my first time, it will get better next time I guess.

Mercado Little Spain,"Hudson yard had finished when I arrived and the coveted Jose Andre has opened up Mercado Little Spain under Hudson Yard. We HAD to come here.

We decided to get reservations to Leña.

We first ordered a bottle of red wine. Then got the Pan de Cristal Con Tomate which was grilled bread with garlic and tomatoes. Amazing. So simple yet so delicious.

We opted for the Conchinillo-quarter because there was only two of us.

The quarter of the pig came out and oh my gosh it was so crispy. The skinny was cooked perfectly. We also got a side of ensalada de cogollos which was a plate of greens, pimientos del piquillo confitado was a skillet of sautéed bell peppers  and puré de patatas al aceite de oliva which was mashed potatoes with olive oil which was AMAZING.

After dinner we had to hit up the kiosk and see what they were like.

I got some fried churros and a cup of chocolate sauce and he got some dulce de leche ice cream. Both were AMAZING desserts!

I highly recommend coming here if it's your first time in NYC.

You can start at a bar and get a drink, while waiting for your dinner reservations. Then after you should check out the kiosk see what other little food options are available !",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I want to say first off so you know where I am coming from that I hate these gimmicky bazaar atmosphere upscale overpriced mall like food courts with a passion.  

Someone in the group wanted to come here so we did--I wasted a lot of time walking around to all the stations and in the end--it all looked mediocre and there was nothing compelling.

Eventually settled on a Salad with Tuna.  It was fine, but not worth the effort.

You wait in line to order, you wait and wait and wait until they prepare your dish, you pay, you carry your tray around the place to find a table, clean it yourself, steal chairs from another table and move them over, and jump back up for water and napkins and utensils.

Go to a restaurant that has an owner or professional manager that specializes in a few key dishes and does them to perfection instead of the  McDonald's of Spain.

Sorry, I am trying to make a point.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Great spot to try lots of things... they have many stands in the market with so many things to try. They have huge pans of paella, fresh fish and seafood, sandwiches, cured meats and cheese, fresh bread, pastries, empanadas, bravas, churros, flatbreads, ice cream, a coffee shop, fruits and vegetables and a tapas bar. They also have 2 cocktail bars and a wine bar as well as 3 sit down restaurants. So many things to see and try. They also have a gift shop, flowers, and a retail shop. It's a nice spot to walk around and sample many things... Definitely check them out.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Very nice place inside Hudson Yards
Is definitely more toruistic than local.
Is like the same concept of Chelsea Market but Spain style food only.  
Place gets very crowded,  and very hard to find a seat.  
Price are little bit expensive but food is delicious.  
I tried a Valencia Paella and was very tasty.  Also Spain empanadas were great.  
Is a must for tourists!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Not a fan. Pretty overrated, but a good social experience with friends. Essentially, you pick food items you want from each booth and then find a table to share your tapas with friends, or just devour yourself.

We ordered:
- Paella Valencia  $16.00
- Dozen Churros  $10.00 with Chocolate Shot  $4.00
- Fancy Jamon
- Potato Egg Pancake

Everything is generally overpriced but decent. It's not as good as Spanish restaurants in the city and is pretty unmemorable food.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Located downstairs of the mall. This place was insanely packed even on a Monday night. Ordering and finding seats was nearly impossible. The workers looked overwhelmed.

The interior looked nice at a glance but after taking a tour.. I felt that it was poorly designed. Each food stall looked the same and were difficult to distinguish for someone who isn't familiar with Spanish cuisine.

I tried the jambon and cheese which was overpriced and served on a paper plate with few bread sticks. How disappointing... The steak sandwich was dry and lacking flavor. The cocktails weren't strong and even the cava was just okay.

I think it's one of those places you visit once. I have no interest in returning.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I love the little mini-exhibition on Spanish food on the mezzanine before you descend into Mercado Little Spain. I think Chef José Andrés did a great job selecting which elements to showcase in the food hall; there were a lot of regional specialities including Valencian paella to Andalusian gazpacho to Mallorcan ensaïmada.

I particularly enjoyed the patatas bravas ($8), which according to a staff member was one of the more popular kiosks. The fried potato cubes smothered in a creamy aioli and spicy tomato sauce are an excellent choice for groups, as is the zucchini coca ($16) which comes generously drizzled in olive oil. The bacon and goat cheese added some great savory depth. The gazpacho clasico ($6) is also a great choice if the potatoes or flatbreads sound too heavy. It's refreshingly cold, creamy and garlicky.

As the place is often packed, I have not yet been able to try the restaurants but will definitely return to do so.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Love love love it.
Jose Andres did an amazing job here!
The food... the oysters and mussels in one area, the meat cuts and cheese in another!!! Wow!!! And the alcohol selection, from wines to liquor, from beer to Sangria and cocktails. Oh my f---- God! All amazing!!!
At the Bar Celona Lee the bar tender treated us so well we didn't want to leave and we actually delayed our entrance to the vessel.  
I can't wait for next time!! And it will be ... SOON!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"After waking around the Vessel at the Hudson Yards we decided it was time to sit and eat. We wanted to eat someplace casual so Little Spain it was. Thank goodness we went fairly early because it gets pretty busy and it's hard to get a table with seats. They have high standing tables and regular tables to sit. We walked around at first to see all the different food kiosks.

Once we found a table it was go time. First round we shared a flatbread and two orange sodas ($27). Second round: pork empanada (note: it's served room temperature, they don't warm it up for you. Last round was the meat and cheese sandwich (Don't remember exact price but it was definitely close to $20). Wanted to try dessert but I was surprisingly too full lol.

Overall it was a pleasant (but pricey) experience. Definitely got my workout getting our lunch. Makes me want to book a trip to Spain and visit Madrid and Barcelona.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Relatively tiny food hall that's somehow both in the basement and street level. How can you explain that??

Lots of different vendors with legit Spanish dishes. Reminded me of my time in Madrid.

Good amount of seating, though it can fill up with tourists and lunchers.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Looks like we found a hidden spanish food place. It was packed with so many people so we can tell how their food is. This place has around 20-30 shops inside including sandwiches, barbecue, coffee, churros and a lot more. I was with my husband and we could not try food from here as it was very very crowded but we stood in line for churros place for about 10 mins and it came out the best dessert ever. We got 6 churros with hot chocolate sauce, who does not like churro(:D) and with chocolate sauce it was perfect. the chocolate was hot, was not very sweet and almost tasted like thick dark chocolate. I wish I could have this dish everyday. It was so good. All the churros were frying in front of us and were serving fresh. They also have savory churros with a sprinkle of their own spice mix.

Its a must visit place ignoring the rush inside.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Fantastic but on the pricey side for style of eating.

Really clean and cute interior- great graphics, bright colors, funky designs. Similar in concept to Eataly or Le District its a great sampling of Spanish flavors

We stopped in for a later night nibble and sampled a number of dishes. The Patatas bravas were better than any I had in Spain! The sauce on top- smoky and spicy - I wanted to have a dollop on each bite of potato.  We also had a chicken croquette - creamy, savory crunchy exterior ... delicious! The liquid olives - MUST try- I have never experienced anything like this before - a bite of perfection!  We also tried the sausage and tomato bread - sausage were OK but nothing special, the tomato bread was delicious. We also sampled the red and white gazpacho - MUST TRY THese!! And then churros with chocolate and ice cream with olive oil and butter orange to end ... yummmmmm",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"My first visit to the Hudson Yards and I went to see the Vessel.  I was not planing anything else but I still venture to the big Mall with the Neiman Marcus name in big letters with 100 shops but it don't look it.  And I see this sign on first floor for  Little Spain and decided to check it out and walked to flights of stairs down.

Well Little Spain is a big Spanish Eatery.  Dozen or so shops, restaurants, cafes and bars.  And lots of people here and would say they were half and half tourist and after work crowds. They are open from 11 AM to 11PM and I got here like 7:30.  Not all the buildings have open yet so I hope they got expansion space.

The stalls stops, are intermix, you can order food at one area and sit and  eat at another spot where you just order a beer or wine that comes from a third.  Some areas I would say are full blown restaurants and others are more like take out.

I didn't try try the food because I wanted a sense of what's here and then comeback.  But it's more of a market in Spain than anything else. With prices that are average New York for some things and very high for others. Some of the standouts here where the Spanish Diner, La Barra, Lena, Mar, Churros, Bocata & Empanads.  but they are lots more and a lot to explore here for me come next time I am here.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I'm a huge fan of Spanish food and was really looking forward for this place to open. I came on a Friday night and the place was packed. Walked around and was really looking forward to having some paella but they only had vegetarian and chicken/duck. When it comes to paella I only like seafood so I was super disappointed. Kept walking and decided to try some tapas which were all great. Had pan con tomate, liquid olives, gambas al ajillo, batatas bravas and churros. I have to say everything was excellent except for the churros, they weren't good at all and will skip them next time.
They also have a great wine selection which I was super happy about.
The prices aren't cheap at all but hey this is NYC so its just part of eating out.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"It is a good market with some good Spanish food. However, it is not *that* impressive. Plus, it is crowded, quite expensive and somewhat confusing.

There is not enough seating, and there are more standing tables than sitting table. I had to take my cheese plate and wine and walk around the market again and again just to find a table. In the end, I only found a standing table and had to eat my 50-dollar dinner standing. That was not very pleasant.

As for food:
Potato tortilla - the egg potato dish. 8/10. It is good, with melting potato sauce inside of omelette.

Cheese and meat plate - 8/10. Good variety of cheese and meat to choose from, but I wish it is served with baguette instead of cookies

Paella - 7/10. I prefer the socarrat ones",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Other than the restaurants, you can pretty much sit wherever you want. This place was pretty packed on this Friday night. My friend who's been to spain says this place is reminiscent of spain. It's certainly very relaxed and fun to hang out here. Prices are very manhattan, $14 cocktails and $8 beers. We ordered from Bar Celona (get it?!) Beer wasn't ice cold, so that was a little disappointing. Sangira was nice but was very light bodied.  Also had some octopus empanada which is made in a large size (think pizza pie) and sold by the slice. It was tasty.

We were touristing on a hot summer day, we paid for a food tour of the market, which finished right in front of the mall. Since got tickets for the vessel and had to wait 1hr-ish to get in we decided to get some drinks inside the mall.

Mercado Little Spain was kind of hard to find and there are not a lot of signs that take your there. If you are entering the mall through the vessel entrance, make a right and take the stairs down (don't get distracted with the stores).

After our dinner at Mar, my wife and I ordered some churros. The churros were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and the chocolate was delicious and hot. I'm not exaggerating when I say we finished our dessert in a minute and 30 seconds. As a matter of fact, I took the chocolate to go and started drinking it LOL (I think I might have a problem when it comes to sugar).",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Excellent date night spot with plenty of options and authentic cuisine shipped directly from Spain. You must try the sandwiches and aperitifs.

Mercado Little Spain,"This is the type of food hall where I could spend an entire day eating breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I was amazed with everything they offered. There was a stand for tapas, Jamon & Queso, churros, patatas bravas, empanadas, paella, pasteles, helado, the list goes on.  I wanted it all!

After our dinner at Mar, my friends and I stopped by Jamon &Queso and had a platter of their delicious jamon and manchego cheese.  It came with a few breadsticks which was nice.   Afterwards, for dessert we had an order of churros y chocolate.  The churros are made to order and the chocolate dipping sauce was to die for.  It was literally melted chocolate.  We loved the chocolate so much that we drank the remaining sauce like there was no tomorrow.

Even for a Wednesday night, the place was packed.  It was hard to find somewhere to sit but we were able to grab a standing table.  The crowd was a bit much, but I don't blame them.  Definitely will return to try more.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"We came here on New Year's Eve and it was the only place we could find to eat that was still in the mall. It was a bit overwhelming to decide what to order since there were so many food stalls. The dishes were pretty expensive, as it ended up being over $20 for a sandwich. I wasn't really sure what to expect for what I ordered from reading the description. In the end it wasn't my favorite, as it had a very sour pickle-y taste.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Originally introduced to Mercado Little Spain via a Yelp event, in which I was able to try patatas bravas, cheeses with olives, sandwiches and canned mussels with chips. It was a curious tasty spread that had brought me back into the Mercado. This time to try the Pepita Ternera and Zucchini, bacon, goat cheese, hazelnut flatbread Coca (flatbread.) It was flavorful, distinct and filling. I recommend sharing and that is why I don't mind $19 for a full sandwich. It is definitely sharable. To get the most out of the Mercado, I'd definitely suggest ordering a bit of everything. I do think they have a great selection that took me back to Spain. What I also would like to note is that it is pretty awesome the staff seemed to be able to go from counter to counter and always be helpful.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"When I found out chef José Andrés opened up a restaurant at the Hudson Yards I knew I had to go. Take the escalators down to the lower level to find the food court. There you'll find various types of Spanish cuisines as well as a large wine selection. You can grab a seat by the bar or take your meal to one of the communal tables.

I chose the paella, churros dipped in chocolate, and flán. It was fabulous! The paella is prepared in plain view of the customers and you can observe the cook handling the flaming pan. It was my first time trying churros and it won't be my last. It was every bit as good as it looks. The flán was kind of like a cheesecake although sweeter. It left a nice taste in my mouth both figuratively and literally. It was the perfect way to end the meal. I will certainly return.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Situated in Hudson Yards you'll find this spanish version of eataly (italian). Mercado is one of the sit down eateries inside. Bar seating you'll find this focusing on tapas. Great service. Explaining the menu and a nice overall menu of alcohol to accompany your tapas.

Some standouts were the potato cheese croquettes. Cheese inside, soft and melty, with a nice cripsy crust. To me the chicken skewers were the best. Made ala plancha on the flat grill. Chicken was tender juicy and packed with flavor. A standout. Also the ox tail dish. A reduced wine sauce with large succulent ox tail. The shrimp and garlic dish was also wonderful. Go for the veal pork meatballs as well. You can always round it out with the jamon (ham) and cheese pressed sandiwches. Very satisfying.

A great rose was on the menu which went well with everything. Will definitely be back.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Ate:
Cafe con leche
Chocolate croissant
Huevos con pisto

Mercado Little Spain,"This place is really A-ok.

People have been saying it's like eataly, but eataly is more like a super market + restaurants. This place didn't seem to have as much merchandise to sell as eataly. It's actually a lot of eateries, like Chelsea market.

the food was very a-ok. It's very expensive, and not sure if the food matched the price. So a bit disappointed by the delivery in flavor.

- churro: wasn't oily, was crisp. $5 for 6 pieces and $4 for the cup of chocolate to dip. The chocolate was medium thickness, flavor was ok
- paella: $17 and there wasn't much crisp, had lot of sauce and seemed like a risotto
- the egg potato: $5 and was cold

There is seating for certain eateries. then there is also seating in the middle for those getting food from a mixture of different places. It's kinda like a theme park, lots of different places to get food, then look for a picnic table to stop and eat

Bathroom is all the way in the back, make a left. Super clean with many stalls.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Our main reason for visiting NYC was to visit Mercado Little Spain! We have been fans of Jose Andres, Albert Adria, and Ferran Adria for a long time. We've also been fortunate to dine at The in Miami and most recently Enigma in Barcelona Spain.

When I heard about the opening of Mercado Little Spain I badly wanted to attend but scheduling wouldn't allow it. Finally, we were in line to enter the space.

The staff welcomed us in with wide smiles and while not every area was open yet our visit was so worth it!

Walking around the space we read the menus, watched the chefs cook, and tried to decide how we were going to control ourselves after our big lunch. My one disappointment is there isn't enough seating for the kiosk vibe. We first walked around holding our food looking for space and finally ended up standing and using a countertop.

Our first selections were patatas bravas (potatoes with a spicy sauce and aioli), Iberico de Belotta jamon, and a Coca (a type of flat bread). The patatas bravas were good, you can never go wrong with Iberico jamon, and the Coca was surprisingly satisfying! After a long wait, we also enjoyed a Vermut each (blanco) along with the most amazing Paella! The paella was deep in flavor, the meat tender, and the rice well cooked. The only bit missing was a crunch from rice at the bottom of the pan.

Before leaving for the night, we purchased some
churros and chocolate to enjoy back at the hotel after we walked off some of the food! They were amazing and addictive!

I can't even begin to tell you how badly I want to visit again and try out their newly opened restaurants as well as some of the kiosks we enjoyed!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Been wanting to come and sample all the different dishes and I was finally able to come with a few friends to do so. Hard to decide what to get when you come by yourself.

We came on a nice Sat evening and the place was packed. The elevator that goes directly to Little Spain from the first floor of the mall was closed so we had to go out of the mall to enter it from the outside. No big deal but it could be a bit confusing to find. Note that Little Spain is open at 5pm so don't think about coming for lunch at this point. Service was excellent. You won't find garbage bins as there were many staff who would take any garbage from you/clean your table throughout the hours. Great idea as many times garbage bins could overflow and they take up the valuable space! Wish they had more seatings. Luckily our friends scored a table (standing) but later on we got a table where we could sit. Now onto the food!

Paella at Lena: only the veggies and meat (chicken) were available. Small portion for a pretty high price (about $16). It also takes about 25 mins to make but they will text you when your order is ready.

Coca (flatbreads): our favorite among the dishes we tried. Great portion to share. Crust was crispy. Those hams were truly amazing.

Jamon & Queso: got the Iberica sandwich. Bread was crunchy and ham was delicious. Long sandwich wrapped and good to share.

Churro: got a dozen. Awesome as appetizer and dessert! We were munching on them while waiting for the food and had it afterwards. The chocolate was good too as it wasn't super sweet.

Spicy Fried Potatoes at Bravas: definitely get this. Turned out that it wasn't spicy. Perfect appetizer!

We got the lime and lemon flavored drinks in cans which were good. We were so full and had no room to try the rest especially the desserts. Well, that just gave us a reason to go back. Can't wait for the rest of the sections to open up for more seatings.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"This place was crazy busy and very overwhelming. That said, I am so glad we went. A market like this is long overdue. Having lived abroad in Spain, it was great to see a Spanish-style market. I'm not sure if the crowds will lessen once the newness wears off, but it was almost unbearable, with not enough places to go.

While there, we stopped at the patatas bravas stand and got some with the brava sauce and the alioli (I wish there had been a little more about that). The girl in front of me had no clue what she was ordering, and the guy manning the stand didn't know what he was selling, because the description he gave was not accurate.

There were very few places to sit. We attempted to sit at one of the bars and quickly learned you must reserve a seat. We put our name on the list, and within ten minutes had a spot. While there we got some drinks (Tempranillo for me, Mahou for my husband) and some tapas. We could watch the tapas being made. The manchego was served with some bread sticks and fig jam. We also got some calamares that were delicious. On a whim we got the liquid olives, and while they tasted great, I think I would rather have some of the real thing.

There is a small shop where you can buy some products, mostly Jose Andres branded. I bought some chestnut honey that I haven't been able to find since being in Spain.

Lastly, I got a cafe con leche, which was great. There was some confusion on picking it up after ordering, as the girl who I ordered from disappeared. A manager of some kind appeared and I heard her say the girl had been working for ten hours without a break or lunch. That can't be good.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Mercado Little Spain,"I stopped by this place upon its soft opening on March 15th.  There was no sign indicating that the place is not in full operation, and they closed the escalator which would take you directly to Mercado Little Spain from inside the shopping mall.

The security guards by the escalators were not helpful at all.  We went outside the shopping center and walked down the stairs to get to Mercado Little Spain.  There was a line waiting outside at around 5ish that day.  My friend and I waited for about 30 minutes.

Once we went inside, we were told that the only places that were open would be the fried potatoes and churro counters.  The tapas bar with an installation of Parma ham hanging looks the most promising.  It was not open on the 1st day of the grand opening weekend, they were just handing out samples of prosciutto to visitors.  

We tried the patata bravas with aioli and spicy sauce.  When it was our turn to order, they only had enough fried potatoes for 1 large order and 1 small order.  The people waiting behind us would have to wait for someone to get more potatoes.  Normally, this would be one of my go-to dishes when I go to a Spanish tapas place, but I did not like their interpretation of this dish, the spicy sauce tasted very bland.  

There're some sit down restaurants and a store inside of Mercado Little Spain.   There're also a couple wine bars and a big coffee shop.  Once this place is in full operation, it would be a great hangout spot for someone who is visiting Hudson Yards or High Line.  However, given the abundance of good restaurants in that area, I would only stop by this place for a quick happy hour instead of dining at one of the restaurants inside.  Nonetheless, it is still pretty cool to have a spot focusing on Spanish cuisines (one of my favorite cuisines!).  Hopefully, they would have a lot of dishes with good chorizo and seafood on the menus.  I cannot really tell what each place has to offer from visiting during the soft opening on March 15th.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Cute Spanish food court/market that is made up of a bunch of little Spanish eateries.

One quick tip: Since there is still quite a bit of hype surrounding this place, I would recommend visiting around 8 pm. Although El Mercado closes at 10 pm, arriving around that time will give you more time to eat and drink rather than waiting in lines, trying to find spots to sit and/or pushing through crowds.

Oh, another quick tip: If you are visiting with another person, it's best to find a spot to sit (I'm not a big fan of standing around and eating) and take turns grabbing food and beverages while the other person watches the space. Most of the places are pretty cool with you bringing food from other places since it has that whole bougie food court vibe.

Upon arriving on a late Sunday afternoon, I was immediately overwhelmed with the number of food options. We visited on a cold and windy Sunday so the place was not super crowded. After exploring the various markets and the overall aesthetic of the entire space, we decided to set up shop at the wine bar that is near the front of El Mercado. I think we waited about 15 minutes to find a place to sit although there were plenty of standing tables available.

Since we had a late lunch, this was more of a drinking adventure; however, we did have churros, jamon, and papas bravas. The churros were pretty amazing because they were not super oily and heavy, the milk chocolate dipping sauce was silkily smooth. Be aware that you are given a huge amount of chocolate sauce - probably enough for four half dozen orders of the churros. The front bar had plenty of wine options and mixed cocktails. It seemed that everyone was interested in have the Elisa Mora tempranillo, which the bar ran out of. That said, there were plenty of other options. I really enjoyed the mixed cocktails especially since a few of them are gin-based. I thought the Media Combinacion was a little overpriced ($16) for what you receive. The drink is served in a small glass that is mostly ice. Oh well, live an learn.

All in all, I had a pretty positive experience at El Mercado.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Crowded, filled with tourists, loud but the whole ambience is just great. Hustling bustling with decent food options. It's like eataly but it's themed spain but mainly focusing solely on food so you get the idea. They have a few sit down restaurants and bar restaurants but also you can just order and pick up food like food courts. I just wish they would have more seats like more chairs and stools as the place had space to hang but not enough seating. Servers and order takers are pretty nice and very professional. I thought it wasn't as overpriced as Eataly, but still not cheap though but I liked the food so I didn't mind.

They make churros from scratch and you can see them being fried which is served with chocolate. Don't miss it. The top items to try here are jamon and cheese plate, octopus with potatoes, paella, churros and other desserts like flan. The desserts look pretty unique and fancy. They all go really well with drinks. Definitely worth a visit if near Hudson Yards, but expect it to be busy.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"It is not warm yet and the word isn't really out and this place is already j packed on Fridays.

There are some amazing meats to be eaten at this place. However, I think some of the gems you may not run to are the biggest winners.

The spicy potatoes are good. Get the sauces on the side.

The churros and chocolate are great. If you are gonna get them, you might as well get a dozen and the chocolate. They are not cheap with the sipping sauce. I wish the churros were bigger but they were great.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Eataly who??? Just kidding, sort of.
I love Spanish foods and I definitely love this place! Everything looked and smell delicious--it was hard to decide what to eat. I visited early on a Sunday night and it was super poppin' because: it has been open for less than a month, it's a Sunday and it's been hyped up.
I'm just glad it lives up to the hype.
There is something for everyone here. If you want to sit and enjoy a meal, there's Mar or Lena (with a tilde over the n) but if you just feel like a little something to tide you over, there are plenty of options....you can get churros, papas bravas (spicy fried potatoes), ham and cheese plates, and of course paella! I didn't eat the paella but it was definitely tempting.
Prices are on the high side (duh). It's a fancy food hall in a brand new touristy attraction so that's just expected.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Mercado Little Spain,"Stepping into the Mercado Little Spain transported us back to Barcelona and especially el Mercado San Miguel in Madrid. Here we found everything we craved. The prices are slightly higher than Spain  but the quality and flavor is spot on.

We had our favorite Churros and chocolate
Vermouth, & patas bravas. We will have the paella next time. You will find everything gastronomic her that you will find abroad the only thing that was missing was our favorite calamari sandwich. I hope they that sandwich to market.

Price point: average for Manhattan.
Food: quality, fresh, & delicious
Beautiful market transports you back to Spain.

Mercado Little Spain,"I've had my eye on Mercado Little Spain for a while (ever since I heard it was being led by chef Jose Andrés!) and am so glad I finally made it out.

100% feels like a Spanish version of Eataly and I say that as a major compliment. This is what I and anyone who has fallen in love with Spain has been missing.

This is a really awesome hang out for a date or with friends (or family, or if you're visiting NYC and playing tourist). It's a great casual spot, good for a quick-ish bite, an escape from the cold, a brief moment of eats that take you back to Spain, and so on. But, it does get crowded. The seating isn't overly plentiful so I imagine it gets pretty wild around the holidays with lots of tourists in the city.

All that said, if you can stand the crowds, come here for some really good tapas and drinks. Patatas bravas and croquetas were a couple of my faves!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I've been trying to get into this market since opening and I finally made it and was around on a night where it was relatively quiet.
There are a couple of options to eat here but nothing that really looks good. They have a paella station, meat station, fish station, wine bar, dessert cafe area. I circled once and didn't particularly find anything interesting.
Ended up ordering the paella and it was just okay. The ham with potatoes was better. The ham was tasty and the potatoes were cooked very well.
For dessert, we got some pastries and they were good.
It's definitely not worth going to this place, especially with the other options Hudson Yards has to offer.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"The Eataly of Spain? Perhaps, but that's probably not fair to Mercado.

It is similar in layout, but that's about it. There's so many places to eat, but it's more about congregating around high tops or eating at countertops, or eating in designated restaurant area or the bars.

I think its great for groups. Just tell everyone to meet at a common table top area and go wild on picking different places to eat. Divide and conquer. Some places have longer lines than others, so going from station to station with an entire group will not lead to eating swiftly.

This is a great option for eating before or after hitting up The Vessel. It seems to cater to a mix of locals and tourist. I live in Jackson Heights, so I skipped some of the stations because the best dang empanadas are from my neighborhood!

This will be a great option for out of town guests who may have already experienced things like Eataly.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I love this little food hall!

The space can get pretty packed on a busy weekend evening, and it's a bit pricey, but I love it!  I really feel it's pretty authentic (but ofc NYC-priced).  Expect to pay $20-40 per person for a selection of dishes.

We've had the charcuterie plate, flautas (these are sandwiches!), sangria (the pitcher isn't a terrible price), empanadas (Spanish-style), papas bravas, paella, and the churros con chocolate.  

You feel like you're in a little mercado when you eat here.  I wish there were more seating as it can be some effort to get a table for more than 2.  The staff is very quick about cleaning up after you've eaten (sometimes a bit TOO quick), so no worries about having to put your trash away when you've finished eating.

Each of the little stalls have a different theme.  The charcuterie is quite expensive, but what do you expect when you are ordering jamon Iberico or jamon sorrento?  For $25, it's a luxurious treat, but only sized for an appetizer.  If you want something more filling, go with the flautas.  We usually split one, so we can try other dishes... but if you're hungry, one should be plenty (with a side of papas bravas).

The papas bravas are great!  I wish it came with actual forks instead of the toothpicks they insert.  When the potatoes get too saucy, it's hard to pick up with a tiny toothpick.  It's a decent serving (good for two) for $7.

The paella is expensive!!  It's $18 for a serving.  We got the rabbit + chicken since it was either that or just vegetarian.  I was expecting to be blown away.  This was only okay.  Not likely to recommend this as I've had better (and more) for the same price.

The empadas are different.  I guess this is how they eat them in Spain? (I've never been)  They eat more like a casserole than the hand-held empanadas that NYers are used to.  

The churros con chocolate are good -- a bit pricey ($10 + $4 for the chocolate).  We ended up drinking the chocolate as we ran out of churros.  These are Spanish-style... not overly covered in sugar (no cinnamon either).  Nice complement to the drinking / dipping chocolate.

The sangria is nice -- $46 for a pitcher (hey, this is NYC.  A glass is $10, might a well go for the pitcher!)  There is free water if you ask for it at the bar as well.

Overall, I love coming here as a treat, but not likely for everyday--too expensive!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"After visiting Barcelona this summer I was thrilled to check out little Spain at the base of Hudson yards in New York. All the stalls were reminiscent of the delicious food I had in Spain. From the fried potatoes, tortilla, gazpacho, spinach and goat cheese empanada. We never went wrong. I'm so happy this is next to where my friends live because I will definitely be returning! Quick, easy, affordable, delicious!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Eataly, but make it Spanish! I came here closer to when it first opened, and probably had to wait in line around 30 minutes to get inside. Once inside, however, lines at the kiosks were either very short or nonexistent, which was nice.

I ended up trying the patatas bravas and the tomato and basil coca (basically a flatbread, but better). The patatas bravas was good, although not especially unique, but I got my order almost right away after I ordered! The coca was one of the best flatbreads I'd had, and a decent size too - I could only eat half, and I was hungry too! I did have to wait about 10 minutes for it to be made, though.

When I came a few kiosks hadn't opened yet - I'll be back when it's less crowded to try those as well. Worth stopping by especially once the lines die down!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Mercado was fine but absolutely nothing special. Hudson Yards itself is a shitshow IMO. A HUGE mall filled with over-the-top designer stores that are all empty. But I digress. It only makes sense that this sort of mall would have Mercado Little Spain in the basement.

The atmosphere is a bit off and I can't put my finger on why. Maybe because it feels nothing like a Spanish market and there's no authentic feel to it. It's very cold and blah. The employees are unenthusiastic if not rude.

The food was fine. My fiance and I split some sort of sandwich with beef and caramelized onions (unclear if this was actually Spanish cuisine) and patatas bravas that were crisp with good sauces. I certainly won't be running back here and wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"In NYC for a concert, saw this place and decided to stop in. Place was bustling with tourist and locals. You have a choice of fine dining, a diner experience or tapas. We chose to walk Arundel Mercado.  We tried the tomato and manchego coca, flatbread. It was so yummy. Crispy crust, topped with sliced tomatoes and crumbled manchego cheese. We also tried the Futbol Club Barcelona. Crispy bread, fried chicken, lettuce, tomato, shallot mayo, mustard dressing, and bacon. We ordered the half portion and it was still filling. Great blend of flavors.  For dessert, the churros with chocolate. Perfect ending.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Very sad attempt at a Spanish version of Eataly. The merchandise selection is limited. I tried some of the desserts and the gazpacho. The dessert was so-so (and so mediocre I don't even remember what I actually bought), and while the gazpacho was on-point, I waited for over 15 minutes in a 3 ppl line to get the pre-bottled gazpacho to go.

In short, the management needs to revamp the operation or Wholefoods will be taking all the business from this sad place once they open in 2020!",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"This is a really cool concept.
We went on a Saturday night and there was a lot of people there, we walked around to check the different  food options and looking for a place to seat. We got a standing table and ordered sangria  4/5 and the patatas bravas  4/5.
Then we moved to a seating tables ordered the octopus and potatoes 3/5, the valencian paella 3/5  and the churros 3/5.

Overall I was not impressed with the food.

Sangria: nice blend of alcohol. Temperature and presentation were perfect.

Patatas Bravas: portion size and price was decent. The potatoes were warmed and crispy. Sauce The flavor overall was average.
Octopus and potatoes: very oily and the octopus had a really fishy taste. No very tasteful.
Valencian Paella: portion size was great. I think price was hice. It only had 2 pieces of chicken and overall it lacked flavor.
Churros: the churros were crispy  and freshly done. The price for the half dozen was good. The chocolate was not warm enough.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Beautiful space! Don't expect a traditional Spanish market though. Think of it like its higher-end sister.

We shared the pan con tomate and a flauta with jamon & queso. Both were lovely!

It would be even better if they could expand on their merchandise section and sell more of a variety of imported gourmet Spanish foods (bigger selection of conservas, etc.).",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Eataly, Le District, & now Mercado Little Spain --  gimmicky, Disneyfied European markets in Manhattan that are fun to visit with friends once. Obviously does not hold a candle to Barcelona's Mercado de la Boqueria, but that's the vibe they're striving for with samples of meats & beautiful displays of colorful foods.

Compared to the other aforementioned markets, Mercado Little Spain fails at speed of service & taste, hence only 3 stars.

Seats & standing room are nearly impossible to find but my group secured a counter where we all stood around & shared paella, empanadas, & meats & cheeses -- quite underwhelming. We wanted a quick, casual bite before leaving Hudson Yards, but our food was neither cheap nor did we save time by eating here.

Not likely to return; the city has lovely Spanish food elsewhere & this place is overrun by families with young children, some with strollers who like to ankle-check unsuspecting Yelpers (me, I'm the unsuspecting Yelper who got ankle-checked.)",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"What a little gem! I have been looking forward to Little Spain for a few months and was pleasantly surprised to find a couple vegan/ veggie options. I wasn't banking on it given spanish food is not exactly pork or dairy free.

The first thing we tried was a Spanish coca which is Catalan's version of pizza. It was so simple & fresh, I could honestly eat it everyday. There was a tomato, olive oil, & oregano coca I tried (owners confirmed dough was vegan wooo). Their paella bar is also phenomenal! Chefs are stirring up paella on wood fired grills and their vegetarian paella ended up being vegan . It wasn't the best paella I've had but certainly yummy. Last, we tried the Spanish omelet, Tortilla de Patata and after one bite drifted into heaven. This is certainly vegetarian but not vegan but worth taking one bite of if you're slightly flexible on it.

The environment is causal, yet intimate. One thing I really liked is you could order food from one vendor and take it to the wine bar or order wine and walk around to try other food. This is an awesome perk being that all the vendors are run by the same owners so you have the freedom to venture.

Tip- it's conveniently located by the Hudson vessel so take a little tour of the vessel and head down to the basement of the shopping mall for a tapas tour.

I'd probably give this place 5 stars from just the coca and the Spanish omelet, but given I can't comment on the majority of the food as a whole I'll have to stick with 4!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"This was a really fun time. Not cheap (especially compared to a similar type of place in actual Spain), but really good food, friendly service all around, and generally a very fun vibe.

First visit, we started at La Barra and got gazpacho, liquid olives, gambas, and pan con tomate. All of it was very good, but the liquid olives are what will stand out in my memory -- I had never had them before and I really loved them.

Then we moved on to the smaller stands and got patatas bravas, jamon and queso, a tuna empanada, and desserts -- churros with chocolate for my wife, cheesecake for me. Again, all of it was very good, with the desserts being the standout. My said the churros were her favorite of all-time, and I really loved the cheesecake -- it was really soft and cheesy, which my wife wasn't crazy about, but I thought it was incredible.

Solid first visit, and I expect we'll be back to try even more stuff.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I visited because of the Pete Wells NY Times feature (yeah yeah, I know) and I had yet to visit Hudson Yards. 'Cause it has to take something SPECIAL for me to trek into tourist spots in Manhattan on my free time...

And special this aventura was. One that'll bleed your wallet twice over, yet simultaneously make your taste buds sing. I think I've never felt this conflicted over a dining spot!

We started with a $60 pitcher of sangria from La Barra. Wowzers! But one look at the presentation and one sip of the drink, I could taste it was worth every penny. Plus, it took 3 of us 3 plus hours to finish it, so it actually turned out to be quite the value anyway. Certainly over single glass prices.

We had put our names down at Spanish Diner not knowing the confusing system for reserving with a hostess for seats at the dining establishments in the main area. Apparently they usually seat people first come first serve at La Barra, but they were so busy, you had to reserve in order to sit at the bar.

The rules are: you can order drinks at any of the two bars--La Barra and Barcelona--and bring them anywhere in the market, but you can't cross-exchange food from any of the kiosks and ""restaurants"" because the latter has their own food menus.

Example: we had just gotten our churros from the churro spot and we brought them over to La Barra since our reservation intended for drinks only opened up. But, we were (gently) discouraged from sitting at the bar with our churros and were prompted to go over to one of the standing tables to finish them off. Definitely an annoyance that could have soured the experience, but the bartenders explained how this flaw in the market's design leads to this constant confusion that's hurtful to the restaurants with seating having to be the ones to say no. Our service at La Barra and the amount of info we took away about the whole market experience was pretty stellar, so it helped to gloss over those annoyances.

I could list all the foods that were tasty, which was basically everything we tried, but the food experts do a better job. I can simply confirm three things: best gazpacho I've ever had, best churros and chocolate , and the pitcher of the premium sangria during the current sangria festival is worth every penny.

This will be an expensive tasting experience, but it's definitely an experience with flavors that don't disappoint, so if you're up for the adventure, go for it!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"A beautiful summer night - what could be better than a picnic on the Highline with provisions from Little Spain?  Well, this is one of those ideas that might be better in theory than in fact, though it all worked out in the end, thanks to some delicious food.  

We arrived at Mercado already hungry and with only one credit card, which meant we couldn't even divide and conquer.  And service was s-l-o-w.  At first, I was enchanted by the way the people preparing our food took the time to salt and pepper each item, finishing some with a drizzle of olive oil.  By the end of the hour-plus it took to gather our meal, I wanted to reach over the counter and shake them to make them go faster.  And this was a Monday night!  I hate to think what goes on here on a Saturday.  

Warning: it is a bad idea to be even a little bit hangry when navigating the Highline.  You will want to kill people.  At this point, we were shaking with hunger, schlepping our stuff, seething with rage at the parade of tourists who insisted on stopping in front of us for selfies.  We finally found a reasonable place to stop (next to someone having a bad acid trip, who politely turned his back on us before curling up into the fetal position).  The wine was poured, the provisions arrayed, and...

The ham was a disappointment.  The pig, itself, was delicious, but we had just recently shared a most generous plate of Iberico ham at an airport in Madrid for 20 Euros.  We couldn't get over how skimpy the portion was for the price.  And they forgot to include my quince paste!  

Then we moved on to the coca - which they call a flatbread, but resembles a pizza, but is so much more delicious!!!  The crust was like the crust of the pizza we had in Rome - not heavy or dense, but springy and flavorful, topped only with a vibrant sauce of tomatoes.  Wow!  

Then we attacked a half sandwich we bought at the Empanadas kiosk.  It was assembled on fluffy, chewy bread, the likes of which I have no idea where to procure in NYC.  It had griddled slices of beef tenderloin, a sweet-ish mayo based sauce that contrasted beautifully with pickled peppers and some kind of melted cheese.  To die for!!!

Replete with carbs and cheese and pig, sipping our wine in front of a mural of Andy Warhol and Frieda Kahlo, we congratulated ourselves on a perfect picnic.  

Be warned, cheap eats this is not!  And Mercado is definitely not the most practical place to round up large quantities of food. (Also, don't buy the churros without the accompanying chocolate - not worth it).  It would make an excellent place for lunch, or a great spot for a drink and a snack before moving on to another destination.  And I would steer clear on weekends, unless you have the patience of a saint.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Despite the negative reviews, this is a place that you need to go to at least once. I entered through the shops so I had to take the escalator down, which in itself is its own experience. The walls are covered with photos of meat and there are many cute signs directing you to little Spain.

When we came, most of the sit down restaurants had about a 1-2 hr wait. We decided to order foods from the different venues. True to the words of other reviewers, the lines are long and the wait for the food is longer. The food was good, but for the price, you can definitely get better food with better seats! We tried the potatoes brava, which reminded me of my time in Barcelona. This was by far the shortest wait and it was good with the sauce! We had olives, Spanish omelette, and the flatbreads as well. The sangria was 60 dollars, but we were able to get at least 10 drinks from it. It tasted sweeter than I liked and probably had more juice than alcohol.

I do not regret coming, but I dont think I will be going out of my way to come back'",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Mercado Little Spain,"I came when it first opened and the lines out the street level were extremely long however there was another entrance inside Hudson Yards that is not noticeable until you walk down a flight of stairs on the main level. This had a shorter line wait.
This space reminded me a bit of Dekalb Market Hall in Brooklyn since there are multiple stalls of food to choose from and it is also situated downstairs. It is very dim inside, I wish it was slightly brighter as it is already located on the basement level.
I like the range of different food options, all are tapa style and great if you're looking to share some small plates or just there to try a range of food. I came here for a small snack and was drawn to the fresh hot churros.

I used to go to their salad stand inside and was always pleased with the fresh, high quality ingredient salads made to order. What they are serving now is not what I was expecting from a place I love. I wish them the best but will get my salad freshly made at Sweetgreen around the corner from now on.

It was $5/6 but it was sooooo delicious! Next I ordered the chicken croquettas. It was not the cheapest at $12 plus tax but it was soooo tasty. Again these were fried fresh as you order it. There were other places offering Spanish empanadas, Jamon y queso, patatas bravas and so forth but I was too full to eat more than what I had already ordered. Definitely worth checking out if you are at Hudson Yards. The churros were definitely the highlight of my visit!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

We didn't have time to enjoy the food there but the ambience was fun! It seemed like a great place for family and they even have a bar that can seat people. It maybe a great place for dates as well!

The only turn off was the roasted baby pigs.. it was a bit too visual for my taste.

Mercado Little Spain,"If you happen to be strolling along the highline, this is a great market to visit! It seems to be a relatively new venue that houses a myriad of restaurants and businesses in the Hudson yards area. Great way to get exposure and traction from tourists and locals alike! My boyfriend and I decided to stop by for a quick snack during lunch time and were pleasantly surprised with how many options there were. We went with the classic French sandwich jambon, which consisted of 2 main ingredients - cheese + cured ham. The price is a little steep ($16), but you soon realize that it is worth every penny after the first bite. I'm usually not much of a cured meat and cheese person, but this sandwich was the BOMB! It was a very thin but long sandwich, basically bite sized! The ham and cheese is of such high quality!! It made for the perfect snack paired with the perfectly toasted bread. This spot is great if you want to explore a bunch of different ethnic cuisines.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Mercado Little Spain,"While my pregnant self can't currently drink, I'm still so happy they serve calimoxo (wine and Coke) at the bar here! For some reason, it's hard to come by at most Spanish restaurants I frequent. My husband enjoyed two for the both of us. Don't knock it 'til you've tried it...

Now that that's out of the way, I will say I was really happy with our experience at Mercado Little Spain. It reminded me of many European food markets including Mercado de San Miguel in Madrid which is one of my happy places. There are numerous stalls each specializing in one type of Spanish cuisine, everything from bocatas and empanadas, to tortilla and churros. There are also three restaurants, Leña, Mar, and Spanish Diner, if you want to pop a squat and order off a menu. I was with two others and we all divided to snag a variety of eats from the stalls and reconvene to share.

In the end, we landed on patatas bravas, paella, a coca (flatbread), and ice cream! Patatas bravas were a highlight for me and I would recommend getting both the brava (red, somewhat spicy sauce) and aioli (garlic, white sauce) on top. The chicken and rabbit paella was perfectly cooked and had some nice flavor, as did the tomato coca. The soft serve ice cream was another nice treat, with my favorite being the lemon raspberry swirl which was so refreshing on a hot day! Whatever you go for, I don't think you can go wrong. Prices aren't out of control, but you can probably plan on spending around $20 a head for a decent meal.

Perhaps the most stressful aspect of it all was finding a spot to sit and I'm sure this varies during different times of day. I attribute this to be the reason why I forgot to take pics! It was also a little difficult to find but it's on the lowest level of the mall. Eventually we asked for some help to find it!

In the age of food halls and markets, this one stands out to me. I would definitely love to come back to get my tapas on if I'm in the area.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Surprisingly compelling drop of Spain - forget about bringing a group.

Descended upon Little Spain with three families with three infants after the obligatory viewing of the Vessel.  While the plan had been for a grand collection of all the tapas Little Spain had to offer, this plan was laid to waste by an unfortunate lack of seating.  Indoors, two-and-four tops abounded, with little room for strollers and the like.  Granted, there were large picnic benches outside, which was a suboptimal option on a day with suboptimal weather.

Jamon iberico is sublime, just as I recalled from our experiences in Barcelona - price is high, but less so than a round-trip ticket to Spain or the white-knucked terror of trying to sneak a foil-wrapped jamon past US Customs.

Ended up seated at the Spanish Diner.  Okay food, but did not serve paella, which seemed to be only available at the paella stand.  Too bad.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Cool spot, think the Spanish version of Eataly.  Food is obviously pricey and the quality seems a bit lacking in some areas, but it's cool to see a spot like this.  The atmosphere was great and the place wasn't too busy.  Seating might be a little tricky depending on when you come.  Some of the cashiers could have been a bit faster at fulfilling orders too.  I only ended up grabbing a small bit of gazpacho and churros.  The churros were hot and fresh!  Overall, a cool place if you're looking for something around the Hudson Yard.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Food Court with everything from Spain cuisine, by chef Jose Andres! Jamon Iberico, chutoro, dessert, juice, sandwich, seafood, steak.... you name it, they have it all here!

Jam packed with tourists and on lookers, since it's such a new tourist attraction, it will die down in time!

Good place to bring your family here! Finding a table to sit down can be tough on the prime dinner time, especially on the weekend!

Hot and stuffy! They need more air circulation in this place!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Little Spain is located at the bottom level in the Hudson Yards shopping mall.  With the fun Spanish music and large food selections, this is a lively and exciting place!
In addition to the food counters or ""kiosks"", there are 3 restaurants: La Mar, the seafood restaurant; La Lena, the meat focused restaurant; and the Spanish Diner. The last seating for the Spanish Diner ends at 4pm. After that, it's drinks only.
It was too late for the Spanish diner and the other 2 restaurants had a 1-2 hour wait, so we opted to purchase food from the various food counters. We ordered the tomato and pepper flatbread from Pan Con Tomate. This was my favorite of our selections. There were little cherry tomatoes and red peppers. The flatbread was crisp and tasty.
Another favorite was the egg and potato tortilla.  It comes with carmelized onions but we were able to order 1 tortilla without onions. Although this was good, it wasn't as good as what I had before.
There was a paella station that looked promising. There are 2 selections: vegetable paella and the chicken and rabbit paella. I wasn't about to eat a bunny so I purchased the vegetable paella. It was tasty but very salty. We shared and only ate about a quarter of this dish.
There is a patatas bravas stand. I'd skip this next time. It was good but very similar to regular breakfast potatoes.

Although there was not a wait for us to go in, it was very crowded and tables (food court style) are limited. some tables are standing only and some had seats. We felt pretty rushed because there were about 5 groups waiting around us for our table. When they thought we were done, they pounced onto our table, disputing who was there first.

If you want to try different food selections, it is pretty cumbersome to wait in line to order your food, wait 10-15 minutes for them to cook it and then go to another line to order your next selection, wait another 10 minutes for the food and so on and so forth. Add in the crowd and it becomes almost unbearable. You could get in line for your next food selection while waiting for the food from your previous as I did but you will be running around through the crowds.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"This is like an Epcot Center food court in Manhattan. By which I mean, highest quality authentic food in a beautifully thought-out but ultimately upscale theme park setting.
You can tell a lot of money was invested in this food court. The food is displayed beautifully to make your mouth water. It's almost like a VR ad experience of the foods of Spain.
When we came on a Friday night around 8pm it was insanely crowded. It seemed like every Spanish tourist in NYC was here. Plus every other tourist. And everyone on a tinder date.
My friend and I spend a few minutes browsing the shelves and making fun of how high the prices were. In truth, a few thing were affordable and others laughably expensive. You could really drop some serious cash and impress your date at the wine bar.
I was hungry, but overwhelmed by the choices and the lines. We ended up sharing a huge sandwich that had fried chicken and mayo. It was named after a football(soccer) team I think. It was delicious and very unhealthy.
Then we had a dessert topped with pork bits. That's how Spanish people roll. Sorry my vegan friends. We just had to try it and it was delicious, too.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"In a ridiculous mall filled with empty luxury designer-brand stores, there is this oasis on the bottom floor called Mercado Little Spain. The mall is just terrible; $25 billion wasted on marble and New Jersey-like shopping. Skip everything and head downstairs to this excellent food hall. It's not huge and I went on a Monday afternoon so did not struggle with crowds like many people are complaining about. Seating is limited and there are some standing only tables but not many. That's one of the reasons why I sat at the bar at Vino... well, for a seat and for wine.

We had five courses with two glasses of wine each at Vino and everything was excellent including the price. I never am that person who takes a photo of every dish I eat but in this place I could have as each dish is a work of art. All dishes were the highlight and not one misstep. The price too was right and I appreciate that. Highly recommend Vino at Mercado Little Spain.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Summary - Nice Spanish food with New York price.

We were there around 11:15 AM on Saturday with plenty of tables available, not crowded, no line but by the time we finished eating, a bit past noon, it was a madhouse.

We've tried Cocas' zucchini/bacon/goat cheese/hazelnut flatbread, there's a name for it but I forgot, pretty good, $16 or $17.
Also tried Tortilla de Patatas' potato egg omelette, it's okay, nothing really special about it, $10 for half.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"More like 3 1/2 stars.

This place is so popular already, that you first have to wait in a line until you are directed that it's okay to board the escalator.  They even ask you how many in your party just to regulate occupancy. Then you take the escalator downstairs just to walk around to the various booths and buy something to eat.  

After a short stop at Mar (see separate restaurant review), we were still hungry. We walked around to the various other areas to see what appealed. As it's a Spanish market, names on the signs describing what's offered are in Spanish. There are many foreign visitors especially Chinese here and language translation is definitely a problem. I overheard a couple discussing the ""Helado"" place as they were thinking it was gelato. It's actually for ice cream and various pastries (which is in much smaller print). There was a place that made flatbread pizza -- and I think it would have been more popular, especially with kids, if more people knew what ""cocas"" meant.

We wound up at a place that sold empanadas and sandwiches. I don't think most people would know what a ""bocata"" is -- but I guess you can always ask or just look to see what anyone else is eating and figure it out.

We got a sandwich cut in half and shared it. It came on toasted bread. It was very good -- with prosciutto, cheese, and sun dried tomatoes. We stood and ate our sandwiches at a standing counter. There are several tables by the ice cream area, and a bar with seats around it, too. But most of the market is takeout or stand up and eat (except the one sit down restaurant, Mar).

I'm glad we went -- if only to support chef Jose. I'm sure they will be extremely successful just by the popularity of everyone wanting to see the new Hudson Yards.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"For those who try to compare this with Eataly, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed. But if you look at this for what it is and is trying to accomplish, I feel like you'll enjoy yourself. I wandered around through the different stations to see what they had to offer and was greeted everywhere I went. The staff was friendly and excited to educate me about their offerings. I ordered the churros con chocolate and was immediately taken back to Spain just by the smell of the plate in front of me. I walked over to the bar and ordered some Asturian cider and the bartender chatted with me for a few minutes and it was great to feel her excitement for working there. It seems like they're open to feedback and are still working on finding their rhythm so I'm curious to see how Mercado will evolve with time!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"This place came highly recommended from a local. I am solute my loved it. If anyone has every been to an Eataly it's very much the same... just Spanish va Italian. It was very busy and from what I hear it is always that way. Don't let that be a turn off! We tried the Jamón & Queso's kiosk. It had a big variety of various means and cheeses. We had their Jamón Ibérico and cheese. The meat was so tasty! Very different from most of the Italian style meats. We also had a sandwich with the ham as well. We also had a very interesting drink from Spanish Diner. I asked the bartender for a recommendation. He asked if I have ever heard of Porron, which I had not. So I have it a shot. It was a Spanish beer with lemon served in very unique glassware. I will admit it was a little difficult to drink from initially but once I got the hang of it it was good to go! He was nice enough to explain how to drink it.  I honestly can't wait to go back. If I lived near here I would literally be here everyday trying new things. I can't wait to come back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Mercado Little Spain,"This is more like three and half stars for me. The place can be a bit intimidating and overwhelming. Definitely more of a touristy spot than somewhere you'd go as a regular.

I came here during lunch time on a weekday. It's still a lot of people but not super crowded. It was easy enough to find an empty table. I got the tuna empanada and churros with hot chocolate. The empanada was just a-ok. But the churros with hot chocolate was to die for, even though it cost almost $10 for half a dozen churros. My friend got the chicken sandwich from the same kiosk as the empanada place and said it was delicious. Half a sandwich was for $12 and the whole sandwich was $19. The portion size for half a sandwich is pretty big and filling. So it's definitely more economical to share a whole sandwich. Everything here is the pricey side. My friend also got the ice cream which only came in one size. $9 for what would probably be considered medium to large size at other ice cream places. So again, good for sharing.

This is a nice place to bring friends from out of town, order a couple of different foods from the different kiosks and share.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Might be a little biased because we were there 1/2 hour after opening, so it was relatively empty and we could zip from stand to stand.

This is everything Eataly should have been. While there are a few sit down areas, the main food comes from all the little stands. Colors are bright, staff is friendly, lots of sights and smells.

Everything was great.
Rabbit and chicken paella - see it cooked from wood-fired woks
Fried potatoes - smothered from spicy tomato sauce and aioli
""Flautas"" - skinny sandwich crammed with iberico ham and cheese
Churros - very chewy, hot, slightly sweet -- as good as Disneyland

Didn't even get to the cafe, seafood, tapas, flatbread....",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Chef Andre created the most amazing Spanish food hall at Hudson yards. Ice cream, pastries, salad, gazpacho, cheese, coffee, paella, seafood, meats ... Everything and anything.

Mercado Little Spain,"It's worth a visit and definitely the highlight of Hudson Yards - which otherwise is just your standard high-end mall.  It's definitely the Spanish version of Eataly minus the actual stalls/market and pretty fun to go around.  It does get very busy at nights and on weekends so seating is a rare commodity.  Is the food amazing?  Not quite but it is still solid and coming here is definitely a check-the-item-off-the-list, even if you are from NY.  

Some highlights:
1. Valencia paella: Pretty solid although the portion is very small for $20 (including tax and tip).  The chicken and rabbit were flavorful and tender.
2. Bacon, zucchini, creme fraiche, and hazelnut flatbread: Loved this!  It's actually a very generous portion and can easily feed 2-3.  The crust is light and the toppings well-balanced and flavorful.
3. Lemon and hazelnut ice cream with EVOO, caramel, dried apricots, and crumbs: A great blend of different flavors that meshed well together (suprisingly!) in a creamy treat.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,Love the atmosphere! It's a Spanish market filled with great foods and experience. Right by the high line! The empanadas and potatoes are amazing!!,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"This hyped up food hall in Hudson Yards is worth a visit. While there may be less stressful environments to enjoy Spanish food in the city, the bustling scene is the whole point of this place - to mimic the food market experience in Spain. You can order from any of the kiosks and bring the food to whatever table you are able to snag.

I will say, however, that I found the tapas bar ""La Barra"" a little confusing.. it was part of the communal section of the market (not one of the restaurants), yet we had to order through a server, who we could not get the attention of.. because there was only one for the whole area. If it was just the same system where we order at the bar, it would've been easier and more consistent. We just ended up ordering from other kiosks because it was impossible to order.

We had the two different types of paella, manchego cheese and jamon de serrano platter, and beer. Everything was obviously overpriced but nothing outrageous. Paella was good! For dessert, we had churros and cortado, both of which were quite good as well.

All in all, a fun and different food experience, if you know what you're getting yourself into.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

But it's bright, clean and chock full of all the special tidbits that make your mouth water and your heart sing. Had some tarta de Santiago... yes. YES AND YES. Brought one home.

Mercado Little Spain,"A lot of great options here. Although a lot of dishes are served at numerous eateries within the venue (e.g. pan con tomate, gazpacho), there are some choice reasons for picking specific spots. Somewhat disappointed by the market's compact space but Spanish Diner has large doors that can open to the street that provide for a better environment.

Still good to stop at a few kiosks for some other specific offerings or mixing up locations for different courses (better than staying at one spot here). Really enjoyed the liquid olives (although can be too much of an explosion of flavor for some as a friend experienced :p) and the melon at La Barra (located in the middle of the market).

Everything is pretty reasonably priced too, especially for the quality.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"My friend & I shared tapas with our drinks at the food hall. We tried potato omelet - yummy and tender pulpo with potato. Will try more next time. I hope they serve Gilda & Burgos-style morcilla. I prefer small plates & variety of dishes that's why I like the vibes here. The appetizers are designer foods ( & not peasants as the big plate eater would described)

Addendum: On my second visit, my friend & tried the classic gazpacho and pan y tomate at frutas y verduras, pairing of smooth & cruchy that I like. At La Barra - we ordered mussels & sausages with a caña of beer.  The foods are tasty. Will come back for other small plates to try. If your style is to eat huge portions in one sitting  & couldn't wait for your food & have a spicy tongue palette - not sure if this place is for you. The concept of tapas/raciones is small plates to be shared with a drink & chat with friends & bar-hop to other stalls. But there is an option for you to eat quietly in the bar by yourself (if you're friends are stingy or big-portion  & spicy eaters).",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"You have to get the cocas that is called something like ""sobrasada"" it's got a little spicy red sauce w chunks of chorizo and cheese.... it's excellent. The flavor is excellent. The bread had a real crunch. It's a dry crunch. But the oozy oiliness of the chorizo compliments it really well.
The manchego cheese is great! Good manchego.
The goat cheese is good, dense,  a little heavy.
There was a sandwich with tomatoes, cheese and what seemed like a pork Milanese.... it was good... but the coca sobrasada is better!
Great sangria.
Patatas con lacón was ok.... I think the potatoes still need a more flavorful compliment than the lacón. I liked the lacón on its own...reminds me of head cheese. I love head cheese. Lacón in bread w butter...yum! But with the patatas...it was okay..it had paprika and oil drizzled ..but not enough...han over the spicy mayo!
Pan con tomate was ok...it needs that garlic rub
The jamón ibérico and or bellota are okay...
Churros are ok and the chocolate is also ok...
To tell u the truth the churros I've had in ethpan~a is the fried dough you get in a congee ... and the chocolate I'm used to is more on the milk choco, the one served here is more like dark chocolate, so if u r into that, you may like it.
Didn't try the paella, didn't try the tortilla de batatas...but I personally like that tortilla w poro (leeks), looked fluffy and beautiful
This all happened at 8:30p
Finding a table can be tough but u manage.
Go in a group of four. One guards the table, the other three split and get food, reconvene back to the table and the fourth gets the drinks.
Works well",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Myself and five friends had two bottles of wine (retail for $27), cheese and ham board, olives and two flat breads.... $430!!

Even outside of the price, it really was a boring place to be. It's no more than a mall food court. They're obviously trying to recreate Eataly with more space but failing dreadfully. If that's what you want, just go to Eataly.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Food (2/5): Got the chicken and rabbit paella. It's not the best, just OK. For the price ($18) and the small portion it definitely was not worth it. However, the churros with chocolate dip were amazing. Usually churros are too sweet but these had a mild amount of sweetness, the right amount of crunch without being too hard, and the dark chocolate dip was slightly bitter in a good way.

Venue (5/5): Really cool and well designed venue with many options in the food court. Overall clean and well kept.

Service (4/5): Waiters will come to your table and help you clean up which is a very nice touch for a food court. The water station can be very backed up though and drinks are rather expensive.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

We decided we would try a mix of a few different spots to get a try of as much as we could. The Paella spot is delicious but for the cost the portions are small. It was actually like that  for all the locations inside. I mean it is expected sometimes in the city . I ended up spending $100 on lunch and looking at what I got it was pretty pitiful.

Mercado Little Spain,"The smells of this place alone makes me want to weep out in pleasure. The set up for Mercado Little Spain is a nightmare among tourists --- think of it simarirly to how Eataly is setup but even more hustle and bustle and tight quarters. The space is very tiny compared to what it offers in mass quantity. If going with a group, it may be best to stake out a table and then do a divide and conquer to get items of interest. My friends and I were there on Saturday afternoon and enjoyed a taste of everything. It was astounding how quick the service moves once an order is placed. There is no time for overthinking, second guessing, or changing your mind on what you order. You order, you pay, and you get something delicious in less than two minutes. Because of this, I think those of us who can be overwhelmed with smelly sensations and food eye candy, may have a hard time navigating the space. Among the items ordered, my friends and I really enjoyed the patatas bravas (spicy potatos) and the croquetas were also quite good. It was a bit strange that the croquetas are chicken based rather than the traditional jamon(ham), but the dish was excellent anyway. The tortilla de espana was very lackluster and I recommend skipping if you're on the fence with that dish. Also, drinks are quite pricey, but I would advise on trying a pitcher of sangria at the Bar Celona stall, which is a great size if you're splitting among friends.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

The liquid olives were quite unique and delicious...I almost bought a jar to take home! I thought most things were overpriced however.

Mercado Little Spain,"Entering this place had my senses on overload with tons of different food kiosks and bars all around. It is a very confusing layout as some food stalls only had bar seating and not that many open tables around to eat. The staff at the tapas bar seemed confused as to how the ordering process worked as I asked two different people if we could order from the table that we had found and they both said no but another customer at the table next to us was able to.

When it came to getting the food it seemed as if there were servers at certain stalls and at others it was more of a ""grab and go"" situation. After walking around confused for a bit I decided to try the ""Cocas"" which are like pizzas. The one that I had was amazing with the different mix of flavors and nuts.

I probably won't be going back due to the high prices and lack of organization which is a shame since the food is so good.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I came in here when my parents were in town and it was the first time any of us had been to Hudson Yards. No one in my family has been to Spain, so I can't compare the food to anything authentic, but I thought it was just okay. My biggest complaints, similarly to other reviewers, was price point and minimal seating options. For the three of us we shared a couple of dishes, but ended up spending more than we would have at a nice lunch where we actually had table service. I like that they serve on china and in glass cups, however all the silverware is plastic. To me, that really downgrades the experience overall. Additionally, don't try to come here when it's crowded if you really want to sit. My mom is mobility impaired and can't stand at the high tops - we were scouring around the whole place and it took a while for one of the what seemed like 'less than 10' tables with real chairs to open up. The food itself was pretty forgettable - fine while we were eating it but nothing that would bring me back to dine again. The acception was the strawberry and vanilla ice cream wafer sandwich. The ice cream comes in big blocks by flavor and they hand cut it in front of you and put the slab between two delicate wafers. Now that was a tasty ice cream sandwich!!

It was unfortunate that a lot of the kiosks were closed/unavailable, so my friend and I couldn't see all they had to offer.

A representative actually stopped my friend and me to tell us a bit more about the market. For now, Mercado Little Spain opens at 5PM everyday, though they are hoping to expand their hours in the coming months.

Mercado Little Spain,"I love Spanish cuisine and being from DC, I am familiar and fond of José Andrés restaurant ventures. So when I heard that he was opening this behemoth of a project in the shiny new Hudson Yards, I had to check it out.
Not everything was open yet. But most of the small vendors and bars were open. Walking in on a Friday evening it was busy but luckily not sardine-packed. We started at the patatas bravas station. Very good. The bravas were crisp and the aioli and sauce had good flavor.
Next I tried the Paella Valencia (Chicken & Rabbit) from Leña, which wasn't officially open for sit-down dinner. The paella was disappointing tbh, it wasn't too flavorful and you get one scoop of it on a small plate for $17 which isn't great value.
The best was for last which was the ""Bar Celona"" which was a tapas bar. The Olive bite was a clever and flavorful punch of olive-flavor. The croquettes were solid but I've had better. The shrimp tapas was very good with a nice garlic sauce. The calamari was solid but could've been crispier. And to wash it all down in proper fashion was the Parrón of Spanish beer and lime soda. They do have a good selection of drinks native to Spain to enjoy.
Overall, I will hold on final opinion until I try the whole gamut of things they have to offer. The prices are a bit high for what it is, but hey it's NYC, what do you expect? Regardless, the experience is definitely one worth trying. Did it feel super-authentic and scratch my nostalgia for Barcelona? Not really, but whether it's to drink from a parrón, enjoy some jamón, or try some paella, it certainly covers the Spanish food experience the way NYC can.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Mercado Little Spain,"My thoughts on the food & experience:

I've eaten at Mercado Little Spain a few times for dinner & breakfast and the more I experience it, the lower my opinion gets. While the concept is bold, the food itself & the treatment of customers are disappointing.

The Food
As someone who loves Spanish cuisine, I was thrilled to have a cool Spanish market open near my office. However, trying the food, I found it leaves a lot to be desired. Most dishes, such as the pulpo or mushrooms were bland & tasteless. The more decent ones were the rabo del toro and liquid olives, but these were nevertheless overpriced for the quality. Sad to see the locale celebrate the peasant cuisine of Spain, while charging unjustifiable prices for mediocre food.

Experience
The staff can be hit or miss, with some members friendly and others can be rude. One afternoon I bumped into the head chef, Jose Andres, himself there, and was saddened to see how he treated his customers & fans. A few customers ventured to say hello and ask for a picture, and he waived them off with a disgusted look on his face. Of all the celebrities & celebrity chefs I've seen in person, Jose Andres was the least gracious or appreciative of patrons to his restaurant. And it seems like this attitude towards customers trickles down to staff & restaurant.

Overall
There are much better places in New York to experience quality Spanish food, and no need to overpay for this mediocre fare or sit through poor service & hospitality. Stay away!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,I never dreamed I'd ding one of Jose Andreas places but while all the dizzying choices from the stands and kiosks here are quite good - top notch - it's the most uncomfortable place to eat anywhere.  Essentially sampling stations as you have to choose select and buy at each one - then find an open seat - it's impossible to enjoy. And the portions are a tad above sample sizes but at premium Hudson Yards outlandish prices.   I suppose mostly because of the tribute they have to pay to Trumps friend landlord - another good reason to avoid.  I'd guess most of you cash goes to that ass.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I've been here three times before writing this review. I agree with the comparisons to Eataly. However, I feel like Spanish food is still underrated around here. I am excited for people to start trying it more and realizing how amazing it is!
On my first visit, we were two people and accidentally found Mercado after walking around the mall at Hudson Yards. We love Spanish food, so we decided to hang out at one of the smaller tall tables. We got the red sangria, jamon and a cheese selection. I am a fan of pan con tomate, so I need to get that every time. The sangria is very well done, flavorful and they deserve extra points for that jar - the ice does not pass through, so it can't fall and make a mess on your glass/table.
The jamon is very fresh, they cut it to order. The cheeses were a daily selection and they were great with the jamon. The pan con tomate was a bit salty for my taste, but my husband was very happy! Don't get me wrong, it was almost perfect - I am used to eating less salt.
For our second visit, we had one extra hungry person so we tried the papas bravas as well - OMG! They are always fresh since they fry it to order and they put just enough sauce to make it perfect. What is that aioli??? Perfection.
The third time we brought a bigger group (6 people in total), and we did not have a hard time finding a table, which was pretty surprising for a weekend. We had a very fun afternoon with our friends, who left Mercado very impressed.
I have yet to come back to buy some of their products to take home, but this is one of our favorite spots to bring friends from out of town right now!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Good concept but more of a tourist novelty at the end of the day. It's extremely crowded and I didn't really get a sense of the Spanish culture and how it influenced the food. Pretty pricey and portions aren't the best. I wouldn't rush back to this place or even visit it again ... I'd suggest looking for a more authentic, relaxed Spanish culinary experience in NYC",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Just below Hudson Yards shops. Take the escalator Little Spain Market. A vibrant Spanish marketplace that features an array of cafes, counters, restaurants, similar to the Italian marketplace, EATALY down at Flatiron. Very limited tables and seatings. Gets crowded with all the people are surrounding the standing table and people standing counter lines for food. Great place for some tapas, iberico ham, cheese and wine.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Been there twice!
The Spanish Diner is still doable once a year!
The food court is terrible!
1) Bony pieces of chicken and rabbit, salty rice Paella tiny portion $17.42
Get this - they do not sell Seafood Paella!
2) Grilled cheese with a teaspoon of sausage sauce (Bikini Chorizo something)  for $13+

For a cuisine that boasts of meat offerings, most of the shops at the food court actually sell dishes heavy on the bread and very little actual protein! Just sad !

AVOID! This is a major tourist trap!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Incredible experience! Chef Andrés himself was there hand prepping the jamon and queso sandwiches (extremely delicious blend of olive oil, tomato, jamon and manchego cheese)

Patatas Bravas was the best i had in New York (as good as the ones i had in Barcelona)

Cocas (which resembles a long pizza) was incredible, all the ingredients were so fresh and tasty.

The churros with chocolate was a bit too bitter for my taste, but they were fine.

Will definitely be back to experience all the kiosks and reataurants inside the mercado once they are completely open.

Overall an incredible culinary experience, amazing decor and ambiance. Mercado Little Spain is definitely the hottest gastro-spot in the city right now leaving the likes of Chelsea Market or Eataly in the dust",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Someone should tell Jose Andrés that the employees that he has in this place and the people managing it are going to ruin this place.
The Diner didn't had any draft beer (they had issues with the barrels) and the bread and empanada station run out of paper so we had to wait 10min to get our bread.
This is not the first time that we have this kind of issues.
Such a waste of time an extremely unprepared and rude staff.
The food is good though...",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"So so so good! Loved this concept of different and regional Spanish food. Chef Jose Andres is a genius!
This is a fantastic restaurant, the atmosphere is great, reminds me a bit of La Boqueria in Barcelona by the layout, staff is wonderful and very attentive. I went to the restaurant on two evenings of my 4 day trip to NY. The first nite I could not get into the seating area (bummer) so I could not try some of the foods so i came back next day, I think it would be good to offer these tapas not just for the seating at the bar area tho.
The food is delicious, prepared to perfection. I'm local in DC and we definately need a Mercado Little Spain in DC!! asap!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Unfortunately seating comes at a hefty price. Not allowed to sit at different venues though spaces go without patrons. Food is subpar at best. The empanadas are tasteless.  Octopus with potatoes was good, the potato pie tasteless.

The floor personnel did let me know this is how it's done in Spain, really?

I'd rather spend my money elsewhere in this mall, Fuku a better choice as many others.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"We walked by little Spain and was like ""OMG so cool!"" So the next night we ate there and it was a huge let down. We waited for a table in the diner and the service was sooooo bad. Drinks were not very good, food was just ok, and seating was uncomfortable. After dinner we walked around and the market concept is cool, fun if you like mingling with crowds. The drinks are the same at the diff cocktail bars which was sad. Overall, unique cool vibe but lacks The quality and service that makes a great meal.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Mercado Little Spain was a great spot for a casual date on a Tuesday night.  We meandered a bit to figure out what goodies to order and then got a selection of treats: pan con tomate, spicy fried potatoes, croquettes, and churros con chocolate.  All were delicious; although, none were the best I've ever had and all were bit on the pricey side.  That said, it's a fun atmosphere and there are a lot of other options to check out in the future.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"This place is definitely a sight to see, set in a fresh, prime location with beautiful ambience... I just would like to know why the food and service is so bad?! I've gone back twice, thinking the first time was a fluke, but the second time really solidified my stance on this place!

My first trip: there was one person in line before me when I ordered a chicken paella to go, and I watched the ""chef"" make a new giant pot of paella, scoop out the first order and serve it, then scoop out THREE more dishes for himself and the staff to slowly snack on, and proceed to fill my takeout box with the tiny morsel leftover that had one piece of chicken in it. For a $19 dish this is not ok, and after complaining to the girl at the register, she rolled her eyes and told the chef to make me a new one, but never bothered checking back in with me. I eventually got a second fresh batch, but the whole process took 20 minutes and I was fed up.

My second trip: we ordered small bites from different vendors, and everything was so expensive yet so underwhelming! Dishes came cold, coffees came burnt, pizzas came so oily that our prosciutto was literally dripping off with the oil.

Overall, take a walk around! Hudson Yards is absolutely astonishing and is a great addition to this amazing city, but don't buy anything to eat here please. Don't enable this kind of behavior where restauranteurs rely solely on name / location and don't bother with food or service quality. Extremely disappointed.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"This place is a delight!  So much yumminess squeezed into one place, I can't eat enough to satisfy my eyes.

We sat at the seafood bar and kept ordering everything on the menu.  The sizzling shrimp in bubbling butter brought audible satisfaction to the feeding frenzy.

I have yet to try the sandwiches across the way.

I highly recommend this place!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"We explored Mercado Little Spain on Sunday, just 2 days after its opening.  Talk about a mob of people and a mad-house!  At least a couple of places, especially the ""Vino"" bar, were clearly overwhelmed and had some understandable difficulty.  The staff were all seriously friendly, and I am positive that everything will run smoothly with time.

This lively space in the new Hudson Yards is and will continue to be a happening place, similar to Eataly in the Flatiron neighborhood, except with a Spanish focus.  There are various counters or stations focusing on different items.  Part of the fun is watching the busy-ness and the preparation of the food.  Not all stations are open yet; but, the relatively limited food and drink we had were good.  I am sure that we will return to try other items.

We had:

1. Patatas Bravas with aioli, at the BRAVAS station (4 of 5 stars):  The potatoes were deep fried uniformly and, along with the red sauce, had a kick of spiciness.  The aioli was an optional add-on.  This station was very quick in getting out the freshly made papatas bravas.  TIP:  Don't question; just add the aioli!  It provided a nice mellowing.

2. Sandwiches, at the JAMON & QUESO station - Flauta Mixtra de Jamon Serrano y Manchego (4 of 5 stars) and Flauta de Paletilla Iberica (4 of 5 stars): There was a long, slow-moving line for this station, but the sandwiches were being served by Spanish Chef JOSE ANDRES!  Clearly, the demand was phenomenal.  The bread is perfect: crusty on the outside.  The meat on the Paletilla Iberica was more flavorful, but the Jamon Serrano y Manchego was good too.  I may have had a slight preference for the Jamon Serrano y Manchego because I like cheese and I found the taste of the ""salsa-like"" oil (included on both sandwiches) more distracting on the Paletilla Iberica.  TIP:  Eat the sandwiches onsite rather than taking them to-go. The oil will cause the inside of the sandwich to become soggier and soggier with time.

3. House Red Wine, at the VINOS station (3 of 5 stars): This wine was OK; very reasonably priced at ~$10 for a good pour.  It had a little ""edge"" or slight ""vinegary"" end note at first, which faded as I drank more and more.  Next time, I will try the other red wine to taste the difference.

Did I mention that the two sandwiches were made and served by Jose Andres?!

So much more food and drink to try here.  More tapas, paellas, flatbreads...  That will be for the future visits.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Very disappointing experience  because they served me cold paella which has been sitting on the pan for a while and it cost me over than $15 for a small plate.
Churros are pretty good but you'll have to pay another $5 extra for chocolate sauce.
Sangria drink is delicious and liquid olive is amazing.
Fun place to taste a little of everything Spain.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Over priced and Underwhelming. Would have been cheaper and more satisfying to fly to  Spain. I've been to the Mercado, this was no Mercado. Not a fair representation of something Jose Andres would be associated.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,I enjoy markets specially where there are all different kind of shops that specialize in different food. Thought I grab a small bite and enjoy the vibe in Little Spain. 10 min wait to get in on a busy Saturday half an hour after they open (3pm).  I definitely got my small bite for a big hefty price.  As a tourist I guess one check in is enough.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"While this was a well-designed market and had a fun vibe, I found the food to be unimpressive. We may have just not gotten lucky with our selections though. We had the vegetable paella which was fine but served at room temperature which took away from taste. The flatbread/pizza, patatas bravas and churros were all good but nothing amazing or standout. My friend had gone there before and found some exciting options so it's possible other vendors here have things that are more more trying.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Went for the second time and I thought it might be the last as I had already tried a few of the dishes and was I wrong.  Just some context, the wife and I like to venture out and try new things.

I love the bar and exploring each food stand.  You can purchase and bring the food there.  So many items to choose from and Im looking forward to going again.  

Ask for Mimi at the bar.  Just a wonderful person and great food and drink recommendations.  Cheers!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Mercado is a fun little market in Hudson Yards. I like to think of it as Eataly, but for Spanish foods (though you don't really get the full marketplace experience). There numerous bars and vendors and three restaurants. My friends and I hung out in the open seating areas and grabbed a few drinks and some Iberico ham and patatas fritas while we waited for our dinner reservation at Leña. All the food we had (snacks + dinner) was really good and tasted authentic. The food is pretty pricey (~$80 per person for 4 people just at the restaurant) but expected given the location in HY. I think it's a great spot to bring friends who are visiting from out of town since it's already in a touristy area.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,This place has so much potential but for the second time here once again it falls short . The churros look good but taste are mediocre and worse then something you would get at a state fair. Other food is just ok. It is like if it was made by the original chef it would be good . But in reality it just falls short .,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"AMAZING SPANISH FOOD MARKET and keeps on getting better.
Service is attentive, knowledgeable, and everyone is so hospitable.
The food choices are unique and they are all original, imported products from Spain. Everything from the bottled water, the sodas, ham, cheese, bread, rice, wine, beer.... EVERYTHING IS FROM SPAIN!!

but please, accept these facts:

-It is on the STREET LEVEL, not the basement of Hudson Yards.
-DO NOT compare it to Eataly.
-STOP COMPLAINING about the prices! (especially you, tourists) There are so many taxes they have to pay to import their amazing food, wine and beer into this country... and you can thank the president for imposing even more 25% tariffs on Spanish products. you pay!
-Tapas are SMALL PLATES, so their portions are correct for tapas.
-its gets SUPER CROWDED particularly on FRIDAY and SATURDAY
-MAKE A RESERVATION in the restaurants if you want a table.
-DON'T EXPECT A SEAT anywhere when it is crowded and be prepared to stand to eat. lots of standing tables. Unless you arrive at 11:00am.
-ENJOY YOURSELF, it is definitely going to be hectic, bustling, loud, packed, just like a busy market should be, immerse yourself in the experience!
-Make numerous visits! and come with an appetite and thirst for delicious everything.

finally,
DON'T BE CHEAP. be prepared to spend! or don't go out at all!

Mercado Little Spain,"Live across the street and have been dozens of times.  Have tried extremely hard to love and support this establishment.  Have raised the same issue twice to
Two different managers and its very apparent that management actually support the staff treating guests as inconveniences.  This place will make money on volume alone but certainly not on quality or what I believe Jose Andres was aiming to deliver as a whole.  A huge fail all around and a stain on the New York food scene.

Mercado Little Spain,Wow. What a cool place! I loved the marketplace feel and how there were different stations for the different kinds of food.

Mercado Little Spain,"I left my credit card on 7/10 and 8 days later I emailed them, confirmed from them that they got my card and that they will keep it for me. Three weeks later I reached out again wanting to arrange a time to pick up and they said THEY THREW AWAY MY CARD COZ OF SAFETY REASON; and that is because it has passed the 7-day window (which is some ridiculous window I have never heard of).

This is infuriating as they didn't tell me in advance that they will throw it away, and that they promised to keep my card 8 days after I reached out to them.

Customer service is extremely poor.

Food is good but super expensive.

Also that wasn't my first bad customer service. First time I visited there when I was requesting for a seat at the bar, I was told that eating tapas should be standing up as this is how Spain does it. I had a baby on my chest on a carrier ok? And I had been standing for hours with her wandering around, ok? What a snobbish arrogant staff?! And I know how Spain does it coz I have been there many many times, ok? Super super disappointed I wish to give them negative number of stars.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Yet I'd return. The concept is good. All Spanish food in a market style concept. Sort of like a Spanish food court in mid- Manhattan.
They also have a bar with sangría and drinks with a different twist, like Cuba Libre with bitters and nutmeg. I didn't try it but plan to next time.

The drinks were amazing and Unusual and the Iberico sandwich rubbed with tomato juice was incredible, so were the liquid olive which I had 15 years ago while I was in Barcelona.  Still some tweaking to do and I can't wait to come back and soak me up some love from Spain !!!

Mercado Little Spain,"The food was mixed, and the service was quite disappointing.  I wouldn't come again.

In terms of food, I had the ""tortilla"" omelette with potato chips and caramelized onions, and the eggs were completely undercooked and watery, and the potato chips in the omelette were completely soggy.  My wife and my mother had cheese plates, which were tiny and mediocre.  But my wife also had the gazpacho, which was excellent.  And we ordered churros for the table, which were good too.  Our kids had grilled cheese...which were like any other grilled cheese.

The service was lacking. The waiter was nice, just slow and not the brightest.  My wife and my mother both asked for cheese plates, and even though we were seven people at the table and my wife and my mother were literally sitting at opposite ends, they brought a single plate for the two of them and set it in front of my wife.  Then when we asked the waiter for two separate plates given the obvious logistical difficulties, it took about four tries to explain the concept to him.  The cheese plates were also brought on thin pieces of paper rather than actual plates and the jam seeped through the paper onto the table.  And the waiter took forever to bring the check.  We ultimately had to ask a different waiter for it instead.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I was skeptical at first of Mercado Little Spain because I lived in Spain for a few months and experienced the country's delicious food from many different Spanish regions for very low prices. However, I went for dinner because my friends wanted to go, and was overall pleasantly surprised! First, the layout of the market is very comfortable, achieving a great balance between intimacy and community. My friends and I shared the tortilla (a Spanish style ""omelette"" with onions and potatoes) and it tasted very authentic with a nice gooey inside   (And to split with 2 other friends it was $7.50). I also got a ""coca"" which honestly when I was in Spain I never heard of, but it was basically liike a flatbread. I got the coca with manchego, a spanish cheese, and jamón. It was tasty but a bit too crispy for  my taste, the jamón lost it's flavor a bit too much in the oven. Finally I got the olive oil ice cream with candied grapefruit peel and caramel. The ice cream had a delicate flavor, but the grapefruit overwhelmed it. Also it was $9, probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever had. Overall I enjoyed el Mercado and would come back with friends if I spent my money a bit more smart!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Fairly, I am rating my dish only, and not whole market.
I Order paella ,they have two choice , chicken or vegetables, which mean lot less costly than seafood.
I order chicken/rabbit  take out, but there is no rabbit in my plate, and barely in chicken.
It come out to almost 18.00 (16.00+tax, but that.s not why I am rating two stars, the portion is really small, if you are in diet, than this maybe good for you, if you are average new York foodie , than order 2 plates.
Jose Andres, I hate to write negative review,but I hate to pay that much price for very little food, so please put your self in consumer prospective and understand average new yorkers.s need, to become the mercado of spain for new Yorkers , not only for tourists and high salary bankers....be in charge of your business before it.s too late.
I eat so many paella in my life, this one will not come any close to average one.
It.s really salty, and rarely when I complaint about salt.
Chicken is baby chicken which I hate to consume..but probably they using it so it can cook very quickly.
I know that location is really matter for this place and probably the lease is zillions dollars, but I don't think consumers will accept paying more than fair products or foods regardless of this circumstances , but I can tell that this place will not survive in long term with this pricing , and I am hoping that owner /management will start taking this reviews seriously.
Don't be fooled with the first few months, in fact, you are doing well only if you have repeat customers
It.s choice of quantity or quality of the customers, and this places need both of them to succeed, specially quantity.
But for new Yorkers, you better step up , because no one going to come all the way to Hudson yard for bird portion at mercado of spain while leaving ton of restaurants with better food and cheap prices.
If you are opening for tourists or only for workers in Hudson yard building, than I am sorry , I was there by mistake, and you will be fine
Yes many customers can deal with overpriced, buy I cannot deal with bird.s portion.. because not every one want to have 5 or 6 different plates or tapas to be full, not every should to consume 100.00 worth of food if they have to be average , regular visitor, other they will go upster to Milos, probably cheaper by weight, at least for rice .
After finishing , I was trying to see their grocery market, but really shouldn't be called market , as almost nothing in it.
They have bakery, but I did run away after seeing $10.00 chocolate mouse cake,  $9.00cheese cake......",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Mercado Little Spain,"I came here for dinner on a Monday night after visiting the Vessel in Hudson Yards.  I was excited to check it out since I'm a big fan of Spanish food.  They have 3 different sit down restaurants and kiosks.  There's kiosks selling churros, helados (Spanish ice cream), baked goods, cocas (Spanish flatbread pizzas), bocatas (Spanish sandwiches), empanadas (Spanish pastries), paella (Spanish rice dishes), patatas bravas (Spanish spicy potatoes), tortillas (Spanish omelettes), jamon (Spanish ham), queso (Spanish cheese), and wine.  My friend and I shared the Valencia paella ($16) and half dozen churros with chocolate ($8).  The portions were larger than I expected.  The paella was delicious and they had huge chunks of meat.  There were a lot of crispy bits surprisingly even though they use the huge paella pans.  The churros were hot and made to order.  The chocolate wasn't that thick and not too sweet.  The prices were not bad, about average for the area.  I do like this place more than Eataly since there's less people (probably because Hudson Yards is very far west), more spacious, and the decor is much nicer.  I would definitely come back to try other kiosks if I'm ever in the area.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Worst place in the city I've ever been to. Super crowded, not enough tables to be found, wait at the restaurant is over an hour, people at the main bar were rude. Overpriced definitely. Worth it? No way. Paid $12 for a watered down sangria in a rocks glass. Paid $8 for fried potatoes with hot sauce. Will never be back. Good concept, poorly executed.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"In theory, this place should be amazing. Billed as the Spanish version of Eataly, this place really has everything you could possibly want in terms of Spanish food. There are three ""sit-down"" restaurants and a number of kiosks specializing in various hallmarks of Spanish cuisine (tortillas, jamon and queso, paella, churros, patatas bravas, etc.). My favorite was the tortilla kiosk - they serve 2 different kinds of tortilla, a plain (just egg and potato) and a meat option, both reasonably priced and delicious (especially if you prefer your eggs runny, which they excel at here).

The only restaurant I've tried is the tapas bar (La Barra). It's not really a sit-down restaurant though. While there are seats arranged in a U-shaped bar around the central cooking area, seating is first come, first serve - which translates into absolute chaos when it comes to actually finding a seat. I went during dinnertime and of course, all the seats were filled. There's no hostess or any staff member there to explain how you get a seat - you just stand behind a group that looks like they're at the tail end of their meal and wait for them to finish. Of course, looks can be deceiving - I hovered around a couple that seemed like they were just about done but they ended up just ordering more food and wine. Meanwhile, another couple seated on the other side of the bar just shared one order of tapas and left, allowing the person who happened to be standing behind them to swoop in and take their places. There's absolutely no system to this madness and you end up with weird situations where some people wait 45 minutes for a seat while others that happen to get lucky only have to wait 10.

The food itself was pretty good, though vegetarians have very few options here, especially if said vegetarian does not eat tomatoes or olives. The gambas al ajillo (shrimp cooked in garlic) seems to be the crowd favorite and for good reason. I also really enjoyed the manchego and the potato salad. What was a little disappointing was that many classic tapas dishes are not on the menu, which I suspect is partly due to the fact that there are separate kiosks dedicated to those dishes. But an easy fix for that is you can go order tortilla or paella from those other kiosks and eat them at the tapas bar (as seating is generally scarce in the market).",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Thought this place was going to be a better version of Eataly, it is not!
The space is very limited a one feels super cramped. Food was very good and authentic, but very overpriced for what they are serving: tortilla de patatas (eggs and potatoes), churros (fired doe), patatas bravas (fried potatoes).
What I truly missed was the supermarket selection of high end products that Eataly has, Little Spain only had a very very limited selection of Jose Andres branded products. Spain has a great selection of olive oils, wines, cheeses, canned foods - these are not showcased in Little Spain.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,Woah terrible service. It seems like none of the workers at the kiosk want to help the customers or want to be here at all! Awkward!,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Mix one part Eataly, one part smorgasbord and add a bit of Spanish flair and you have Little Spain. Its ambitious, maybe too ambitious, with a good overview of Spanish food (hits the highlights like paella, jamon iberico, etc) but doesn't delve deep enough to satisfy. Its good, but brings to mind the tapas hustle. You know the tapas hustle,  let's serve you a plate that's smaller than an appetizer but charge you half the price of an entree. If they were just a bit bigger, they'd be fine but all the plates ran a tad small then an entree though way bigger than tapas. ( like a larger apperizer)  Each stall offers a few items, with the cafe by the door a standout for its amazing deserts. It's a bit small for the crowds though if you wait  10 to 15 minutes your usually able to get a seat. Fun decor, colorful, and you almost feel like your in a market in Spain, especially on weekends with the crowds. Overall worth a visit, theres quite a bit of variety, and it's a unique addition to the NYC food scene, just wish the prices were a bit less.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Jose Andres took a page out of the Eataly playbook for his first NYC venture. This huge market & restaurant space occupies the whole basement / first floor of the new Hudson Yards mall. You can get to it by taking an escalator downstairs in the mall or walk in from the street outside. We didn't know what to expect and were impressed by how vast the space was. It focuses more on the food aspect and less on the market for groceries and kitchen items like pans and cookbooks. We did a few laps before settling on our choices - you can opt for a sit down meal at one of three restaurants, but they were not open yet either due to the newness of the space or time of day. We got tortas, patatas bravas and churros from each of their respective stands. Prices were high-ish but commensurate with NYC food. Service was friendly and pretty quick considering how busy they were (packed). Our one major issue was seating - they simply don't have enough for the demand. I estimate less than one hundred tables in the whole place with lots of lurkers hawking for seats as soon as a party leaves. We ended up standing squeezed in by one of the doors. Anyway, the food was excellent and the whole thing a really cool surprise. Great spot for a date or to spend some time browsing, if you know what you're getting into.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Horrible Service. Muy desilucionada, had such anticipation and high expectations. I am from the industry, and my husband is an executive chef. Had a reservation at Leña, arrived 30 minutes early, was told to wait. After 25 minutes waiting I ask can we please be seated, I have eaten at many finer restaurants were they do not ""make"" you wait until the exact second. They wouldn't sit us, yet another couple arrived after us and was seated. And they didn't even have a reservation, because the manager was taking the gentleman's number, etc. at that moment. I left in that second, after giving hostess my feedback. So sad. Zero interest in returning. Really should train their front of the house. This is the 1st interaction with guest.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"José Andres's answer to Eataly feels more like a slice of Barcelona's Mercado de la Boqueria manifested in Chelsea, and the Andres team's attention to detail is what makes it particularly great. We crawled the market for a few hours yesterday, sampling the gazpacho (one of the best we've ever had, with soup poured seatside at the La Barra or Vinos counter, perfectly diced veggies, and croutons for texture) over shrimp al ajillo, pan con tomate (so salty and sweet and drenched in good olive oil), chistorra con patatas fritas (spicy little chorizo links wrapped in crispy potato and served with garlic aioli: good to share, probably a little heavy for one person), potato bombas (which are like if patatas bravas married arancini), liquid olives (an El Bulli balloon of briny goodness bursting in your mouth), a plate of jamon iberico, cheese, and quince paste with crunchy bread sticks, a slice of basque cheesecake (with its mind-bending cloudlike texture), and the perfect pomada cocktail (gin, lemon, mint, soda water and whatever else the doctor ordered).

For people crying about wait times and prices, go after pay day and when you have a couple hours to wander. If you don't have that, then know where to go before you do: there are many kiosks with grab-and-go items under $15 (two sandwich stations, empanada counter, patatas bravas, egg tortilla slices, and more). We can't wait to be back next time we're in New York, because the paella valenciana (chicken, rabbit, artichoke) beckons.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Tasted and disappointed. And this is why I often fly to Spain just to indulge in their unmatched culinary arts.

The chef made the biggest mistake. Gambas al ajillo was overcooked so the shrimp tasted like chewy rubber. If you can't even get this classic dish right, there's no point in going further with the menu.

Recommendation: leave the shrimp shell on so that the shrimp is still tender. Thinking that you're doing customers a favor by taking the shell off actually backfires. If your target audience is lazy customers who don't want to use their fingers to get the shell off, then continue cooking the way you do. Maybe the owner should send their chef to Spain at least once to see how this is cooked properly.

The sangria was good and it's why I am giving this place 2 stars. Fresh herbs and good service  saved this place from getting 1 star.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Love this place. The manchego, the fig jam, the potato salad , the sangria- all too good. Beautiful ambiance as well. Lovely place for any occasion really. Also not expensive at all. Overall, fantastic",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I went there about a month ago when only about a third of it was open. There were pros and cons.

Pros: The food had great taste. I am from Barcelona so finding Spanish food in the US can be a hit or miss. We had a full spanish tortilla which was amazing, the eggs were runny and the potatoes were well cooked, probably the best tortilla that I've had it the East Coast. We also had a Sobrasada Coca, which is like a flatbread with a thin crust, the flavors was great but it could have had some more sobrasada or manchego and not so many tomatoes. To end the meal we had churros with hot chocolate. The churros were great but the hot chocolate was not like ""hot chocolate in Spain"", for us hot chocolate is thick so you can dip your churros, this however tasted and felt like chocolate milk.

Cons: We did go about a month ago and the line for everything was crazy. There were barely any spots to seat or even stand to hold your food. This is a food hall, but is ran all by the same company. Some spots have shared menus and others only serve specific things. Wait for food and drinks was surreal. When we finally got the food, I found a spot in a bar stool and was going to order drinks when the bartender told me I couldn't eat the food in there because I had to order food from that specific spot - there were only like 10 tables total that were not attach to a specific spot which made us have to carry our food around and finally find space in a counter of an unopened spot and eat standing. Maybe when everything is open it looks like there would be more seating area but I definitely did not enjoy the ambiance.

Although the food was good I don't know if the whole experience was worth it. But I might go back in the future when everything is open.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Food, service and quality of ingredients are great.  I can't wait for the new restaurants to open up soon so there is more of a variety of food.  We hopped around and tried a few different dishes from each spot and took home some hot sauce!  Everyone is very attentive but you can tell they are still learning themselves.  I think more training is definitely needed with staff though.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

Mercado Little Spain,"I'm a sucker for dining halls and cafeteria-style trendy spots so I loved this space so much! Food halls are abundant in big cities but NYC really wins by having a Spanish food court. I've seen Italian food courts, Asian ones, but never a Spanish one. I've been to Spain a few times and have been to cities like Barcelona, Cordoba, Ibiza, Sevilla, and Madrid. I loved all of the different ways they incorporated Spanish culture into this space. I saw flan, Spanish custard, gelato, cured ham like jamon iberico, gazpacho varieties, coffee, Spanish sodas and much more. I tried an olive oil ice cream with grapefruit and yolk sauce. I wanted to try the hazelnut one as well but they ran out. This place is pretty crowded and busy. It is definitely a fun and happening space. The items here are pretty expensive. I had some delicious coffee here as well. There are lines for the food. Dining is mostly indoors but there are a few tables outside as well. I definitely don't think I can bring a huge group here because it may be hard to find a big table for everyone but it's good for groups in the sense that each person can pick what they like from different food vendors.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this restaurant since I first heard about it about a year ago. The Spanish are finally here. This to me is a Spanish version of Eataly. There are small areas specializing in different Spanish cuisine and a small market with some foods to purchase that home cooks would enjoy. The only kiosks that were open today were the patatas bravas station and churros con chocolate. The bar served a few wines, beer and sangria. Eating these foods transported me to the days I lived in Spain. The staff was just excellent, so friendly and inviting. I can't wait to come back when more is open. I'm dying for some authentic paella.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Reminiscent of Eataly.  We were lucky enough to get 3 seats by the bar in the restaurant, since there was a long wait for a table.  Good sangria and cava that accompanied croquetas, salsiccia, manchego and gazpacho.  The market is cool but crowded, other downside are the acoustics of the restaurant in what might have been an old warehouse.  Perfect spot to grab a bite before walking the High Line.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"This experience was not what I expected. First off the lay out was confusing and there is no organization at all with lines or sitting areas. The patatas bravas were average, paella even though made with wood fire, was a cheap version of what a authentic paella should be. Churros were good but the chocolate was watered down. Pan con tomate was a big disappointment since it is such a staple of Spain, it had no flavor whatsoever, no garlic, no olive oil, just plain mushed tomato on toasted bread. The wine was super expensive with a long wait to sit at la barra. My advice would be save your money and go to boqueria any location of your choosing all over Manhattan and Brooklyn and have yourself the closest and best replica of real authentic food from Spain.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"This place is the worst. The employees are super rude and really don't care about your reservations made a WEEK in advance!

Avoid  this place at all cost, food isn't even that great after all for their OVERPRICED menu and location is HORRIBLE. The worst!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"Although hard to find , it is well worth the looking. The sandwich I shared with my father was delicious, and from sandwich's to churros dipped in chocolate, my favorite was getting to see pig legs hanging in a window. Brought to the stands to be cut and turned into prosciutto, I thought id only get to see that process in Italy. It was a great thing to see, although sad to see the pig get eaten. It was a very welcoming and cute little spot where I would definitely return and even recommend on a scale of 100. And while you're there, make sure to get a free ticket to the Vessel, where they had a very smooth system. Very fun!!!!! Great view of the city, where you can get outstanding photos.

Mercado Little Spain,"I shouldn't have been surprised by the line/wait to get into Mercado, but it is NYC after all. Once inside we enjoyed taking in all the food options, the decor and just exploring.  We didn't try the Coca flatbread, patatas bravas or Jamon everyone has raved about. That will have to be another trip.  We did manage to score a spot at the bar at Mar Restaurant. We had the codfish fritters and oysters as an appetizer and a specialty pork dish for an entree. The fritters were so good, we ordered a second round. Our service was excellent.  This included the assistance of their sommelier who selected a nice bottle Verdejo based on our taste.  
We then hit the churros kiosk.  They were light, not greasy and the chocolate added the finishing touch.
Mercado Little Spain was well thought out by the geniuses of Jose Andres and Alberto/Ferran Adria.  It's a bit expensive but this comes with the use of quality ingredients and the location. I expect it will become even more interesting and popular in the months to come.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,Finally made it to Mercado a few weeks after the open. Not even fully opened yet and it still was wonderful. So many good options.

There's also a sea food oriented restaurant and a meat one. So many options it will require multiple visits. Which is great.

There is a bar called Bar Celona that has standing tables good for groups from 3-6 just for drinks and light apps. You're able to go around to the other sections and bring food over to the bar.

Ordered a carafe of red sangria!,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants
Mercado Little Spain,"As with many great New York experiences, you will wait in line for this one. We queued up for twenty minutes on the street before the 4 p.m. Saturday opening, there was another line inside at the escalators in the mall.

We quickly made our way to the Jamon bar for a sandwich  of Iberico on pan con tomate, and a cone of salcichon. The ham was excellent, on a slender ficelle of very fresh, crusty bread, with a light coating of crushed tomatoes. I was less taken with the cone of sausage- the meat was tasty but a little chewy, and the three breadsticks were forgettable. With La Portena guarding our stools like a hawk, I set off for patatas bravas. A short wait and I had my bravas - slathered in a spicy red sauce, aioli (a $1 supplement) bringing the total cost to $8. The design of the station could be improved, but service was impressive in these early days and the lines are processed efficiently. The bravas themselves were better than most in NY, but not the best I've had here.

We gave up our seats so others might enjoy, and perused the market. A small stand with fresh fruit and veg is fairly central. There is also a small nook serving up oils, vinegars, condiments, chocolates etc., many bearing Chef Andres branding, but that's about it. El Mercado not a place to do your food shopping while having a snack or light meal, it's a place to eat, drink and be merry. Although if the massive aged La Frieda cote de boeuf on display was for sale, I might have tried to buy it, but my banker would have objected.

I somewhat regretted my choice of the bravas when I came to the operation serving the tortillas - they also did a dish of potatoes topped with pork that looked more interesting. We perused the menu at Mar, which looked promising for a return. We bought a trenxo chocolate (spelling phonetic) sort of a chocolate croissant, at the pastry bar - consumed the next day with our coffee, it was excellent. The tapas bar was packed, we continued bereft of pintxos.  

The Yelp reviewers who recommended the Cocos (flatbreads) were spot on - the one we ordered was excellent. Topped with zucchini, bacon and hazelnuts, it was assembled before our eyes in the manner of a fast casual pizza joint. Into a standard Blodgett oven for about 5 minutes, and then topped with herbs, goat cheese and another queso I did not identify. We  ate this a few hours later at home and it was still superb, probably would have been even better fresh from the oven.

Finished up at the store for some of Chef Andres' pepper sauce and a bar of chocolate. Service here was also excellent.

Overall, I thought the prices matched the quality - it was remarkable how well the staff have been trained and the execution was smooth for a place in its fourth week. The con is the physical space - it's not just inadequate for the current crowds, the ratio of seats to food stations is off. There's a sort of Disneyland feel to the place, it's a high end food court and lacks the funk and grit of a real market, but perhaps it will acquire those with age and when all the sceney types move onto the next thing.  

A much needed addition to the New York food scene, where Spanish food has been underrepresented. I definitely recommend a visit, and if you can come on a weekday, I think you will have a great time.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mercado-little-spain-new-york?osq=restaurants

The only complaint I have:  why can't we order from one spot and have a centralized system (iPad to take orders perhaps?) and route the orders to different places for pick up?   We had to line up at different places just to have different dishes.   That kind of made it less enjoyable coz my husband and I couldn't eat together when our kid was hungry.

My favorite panang curry in the city. So flavorful, the right level of spice and heat and flavor. Loved the array of veggies in the curry, not just green peppers, which I always appreciate. The portion was very generous, and traveled well. I got mine with sticky rice, which was absolutely perfect.

- chicken satay (classic appetizer): the chicken was cooked so well and easy to eat. along with the peanut sauce it truly was one of my favorite dishes out of the ones we ordered.
- royal pad thai (privileged entree): definitely my favorite. it was the best pad thai ive ever had and everything from the taste to the presentation blew me away. the pad thai was ""wrapped"" in an egg crepe that looked like a nest!
- salmon tamarind (chef's signature entree): my dad's favorite- the taste of tamarind on salmon is something weve never tried before, and it was pretty good imo!

Super authentic cooking, amazing ambience.

Red Curry- 10/10. everything was there and more! They put thick carrots in theirs which is unique compared to other restaurants, I liked it. And the curry was the right amount of thickness and flavor as well.
Thai tea- absolutely delicious. doesn't taste like the fake powder packets you get at some places. And it comes in this super cute tall glass jar.
I love that they do a weekday lunch special- soup/salad, app, and lunch entree for $14. I did the soup and egg roll as my appetizer- both I was very pleased with!
I came another day for dinner and ordered some other noodle dish along with the Red curry again..but dont remember exactly what it was haha, just that we loved that just as much too!

Environment/Vibes: gorgeous. love the royal look, the decor, the romantic lighting fixtures..the Buddha artwork, its all traditional yet modern looking which I appreciated.

Staff was all in masks and wearing them properly. Hand sanitizer was available for guests. They played music but it wasn't disruptively loud. It seems they have a slightly condensed menu (normal menu is massive so this isn't an issue in the slightest) and a cocktail/summer menu. The food was great and service was quick. We made reservations but there were open tables. Great meal for the price point and my friends got two meals out of it because the portions are quite large.

Panang Curry ($17)
Thai Tea ($5)

Taste | the salmon was in a puff pastry, which tasted great. the pad thai was very saucy and the portions were good for all the dishes. panang curry was a little too soupy for me. they also gave a complimentary soup when we started. The dishes we tried were good, but nothing too different in flavor from what we have in California.

Service | servers were awesome, very attentive.

Parking | Street

Note | joined the waitlist and waited about an 1.5 hours. they gave us a call when our table was ready a little earlier than anticipated. ambiance was beautiful in here.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Really wanted to like this place because all of the great reviews and the Instagram posts of the decor. We joined the waitlist ahead of time and were seated 15 minutes after the estimated time. We were seated upstairs instead of the main floor with all the lights. The upstairs didn't have the same decor as downstairs, but it felt cozy.

Our waitress was really nice. We ordered two drinks (forgot the names but they were tasty - not strong though). We got fried calamari and wings for the appetizer - both of which were great.

For main entrees is where I was really disappointed. We got the pad kee mao and pad see ew with crispy half duck ($24 each). Half way through eating my dish I found a long hair in it and almost wanted to throw up. Our waitress was nice enough to offer to remake my dish, but I really did not want anything to do with this place.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Thai food is some of my favorite. It's my go to when I don't know what to have. I  chose this place for a date night, it is so cute. We had to wait long because it was a Friday night- I expected it since they do not take reservations Friday or Saturday. They told us about 1&1/2 hour wait but only waited about 45 minutes.

It was worth the wait. You get seated, it's a two level  restaurant very nice decor and has a bar area as well. They serve you complimentary butternut squash soup- it has a tang to it but it's free so definitely try it to expand your taste buds!
We got two apps, curry  puffs & some dumplings both delicious probably was too much plus our meal- was very filling for just two people.
We got one drunken noodle and one ground chicken meal with rice and egg on top - only downfall was that my egg was cold which wasn't too pleasant.

The drinks! How can I forget the drinks theyy were sooooo good. The amethyst & another one that had tequila I can't remember the name of it very good!
They served us our drinks as we waited which was great because at least it helped time fly.
The restaurant is small, it can feel cramped but overall good experience glad I finally got to try this Thai place off my yelp collection",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"One of my favorite Thai restaurants! It's a fancy place where gold leaves hang from the ceiling. We received a giant 5 page menu and our waitress talked us through every section. Very thoughtful.
We ordered Tom Yum fried rice and Yellow curry. The seasoning was very spicy and authentic! Recommended!!
I watched Krist Soup's cloudy water tutorial on YouTube and curious to see how Thai pea Flower Tea would turn out to be. We were told to squeeze lemon juice into the blue tea so we can witness the color change from blue to purple. Basic chemistry but very fun to have such magical experience :)
Ps: The place was very busy and we waited 2.5 hours to get in. We liked the place, but 2.5 hours is to long.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"This place is really cozy with really interesting decor. Great place for a date or a celebration dinner.

Curry puff- nice flaky crust but the inside tasted a little dry.

Chicken satay- the chicken was also a little too dry but the sauce made up for it!

Panang curry- I really liked that they added sweet potatoes to it, which I i normally haven't seen. The portion is good to share with another person.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Freakin' amazing Thai food can be found at Thai Villa! It's not surprising they were super super busy on a Tuesday night. However, make sure you add yourself to the waitlist on Yelp. My coworker and I saw there was no waitlist around 5:45pm, and then it was a 30 minute wait only 15 minutes later. By the time we arrived, the restaurant was packed and there were tons of people waiting for a table. The ambiance is gorgeous, and they have a second level in addition to the main floor. They have classic Thai decorations but also a very modern vibe. We checked in and were seated after about 15 minutes, and tried:

-Complimentary Soup (yelp.com/user_local_phot…): Delicious, and super flavorful. This was a great start to our meal.
-Spicy Chicken Wings (Deep Fried Marinated Tom Yum Flavor Wings, Thai Herbs Garnished, $12, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): The wings were fried perfectly, and they were very flavorful.
-Pad Kee Mao (Broad Noodles, Chili, Onion, Hot Pepper, Egg, Basil Leaves w/Crispy Duck, $16, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): Delicious, and a must order! The noodles were so soft, and the crispy duck was really good.
-Green Curry (Heart of Palm, Thai Eggplant, Pineapple, Basil Leaves, Coconut Milk, w/Beef, $16, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): Also delicious, and highly recommended! This green curry had great flavor.
-Pla Lad Prig (Deep Fried Fillet of Branzino w/Sweet & Spicy Sauce, Baby Bok Choy, $32, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): I'm usually not a big fan of crispy fish, but they made this dish well. The fish was fresh and fried perfectly, and the sweet and spicy sauce was really good.
-Banana Crepe w/Coconut Ice Cream ($12, yelp.com/user_local_phot…): Yum- the crepe was nice and light and the coconut ice cream was really fresh.

Service was very friendly and efficient, and our food came out quickly after we ordered. The tables are small, and all of our dishes barely fit, so be careful if you also have a small table. It's very cozy inside of the restaurant, and the tables are close together. However, it's all worth it to eat the delicious and reasonably priced dishes here! I hope to be back to try their other curry and noodle dishes.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"The table wait 2 hours for a party of 2 so we opted for the available bar seats. The bartender and bar back were very sweet and attentive. My friend and I just wanted something small so we split the curry puffs and chicken pad Thai. They were both rreally delicious  

I loved that they had an ""american"" part to the menu butt also traditional because I love traditional Thai. I would love to book a birthday party here next year.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"INCREDIBLE ambiance. The decor in here makes you feel like you've traveled to Thailand - wow the memories!

The presentation of each dish was thoughtful and eye-appealing and the food was on point flavor wise!! Here's what we got:

- Royal Pad thai- this was good! Wrapped in a web of eggs, and topped with a giant prawn. It was beautiful!
- Moo-Obb Nam Puaung - grilled Mariinated pork with Sticky rice, waiter- recommended, satisfied customers
- spicy chicken wings - these didn't stand a chance! So flavorful and not too spicy
- Mor Khang Brulee with Coconut Ice Cream - a puff pastry topped with a medley of things and coconut ice cream. SO  GOOD

I would def come back here!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I've been wanting to try Thai Villa given its high rating, so I suggested this place to 3 other friends. Sure, the food presentation and ambiance was on point, but the food was very disappointing. Maybe we went during the wrong time or ordered the wrong dishes, but I felt bad for suggesting it as we waited 2 hours for a subpar meal. The way they manage the waiting system was also extremely inefficient; we were just going in and out multiple times because of miscommunications.

Here's what we ordered:

APPETIZERS
1) Ray Rai Nah Phi ($13): shrimp, rice noodles with curry paste wrapped with betel leaf topped with crab meat (4 pc). Very interesting appetizer; once you eat everything in one bite, there's so many things going on. It's full of flavor, refreshing, and tastes very light.

2) Tod Mun Koong ($12): shrimp, ground pork, egg bread crumbs, white pepper with plum sauce--shrimp cake (3 pc). This was definitely the highlight of the whole meal. I highly recommend.  

*After we finished our appetizers, we waited 30 minutes for our entrees.

ENTREES
1) Moo Obb Nam Puaung - Grilled marinated pork with honey-soy glazed, bok choy, coconut sticky rice ($26): This was the best entree amongst the things we ordered; however, I was quite disappointed with the coconut sticky rice as I tasted no coconut. Pork was tender and seasoned well though.

2) Ped Ron - Crispy Five Spice Duck ($28): They were not stingy with the meat portion as it was surprisingly meaty. Skin was crisped perfectly, but the meat itself was lacking in some flavor. It's definitely not for everyone.

3) Kha Nom Boung Youen - Crispy egg crepe stuffed with assorted seafood ($20): Personally, this was everyone's least favorite entree. The cucumber relish that comes on the side was too sweet and we just couldn't eat it after few bites. Something was definitely missing from this dish...

4) Royal Pad Thai ($24): This was just okay. Presentation was beautiful, but it was definitely nothing to rave about. I was expecting something different than a normal pad thai, but I was less than impressed. Just a standard dish.

Overall, this is very overrated Thai establishment. Price is definitely on the high side as our meal came out to be $160 after tax/tip. I don't think it's worth the wait to get in; there are other Thai restaurants that serve better food at a cheaper price. 1 star for the delicious appetizers and complimentary butternut squash shots and 1 star for the beautiful ambiance/food presentation.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Great for lunch, loved it! Green Curry is my favorite. Great ambiance!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"There was a period of time when Thai Villa first opened where I went every week for weeks on end without fail. If you know me and know how I don't repeat restaurants because NYC spoils me silly with endlessly delicious eateries, this is a strange aberration in the life of Morlene. Yes, Thai Villa was really just that good. Beautiful decor that makes you feel like you're dining in the palace of Thai royalty, an incredibly fast kitchen, such that you can have your food out within minutes of ordering and be done with lunch/dinner within an hour, and punchy, piquant, aromatic, curries, noodles, and papaya salad galore. Wow, that was a run on sentence. Basically, it was a dream.

Fast forward a few years and much of this is still true. The service is still speedy, the space is still beautiful. The food is also quite delicious, but there's something up with that mock  duck. I used to think the gold standard for it could be found  here at Thai Villa, but the crisp, flavorful prices of gluten I used to know here have made way for spongy gross gluten. Okay I know this is only going to matter to the very small percentage of people who come here and order mock duck, but I'm talking to you, fellow mock duck lover, maybe order tofu when you come here.

Their lunch special is great value since you get a soup or salad plus appetizer with your entree. But the more interesting dishes are on the dinner menu, including the ""royal pad thai"" which comes wrapped in egg netting. Check photos on Yelp to see what I'm talking about.

Join the virtual queue on Yelp Waitlist to avoid waiting for your table, that service is clutch.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"The restaurant is surprisingly beautiful on the inside, having an ambiance that makes you feel like your in a high end place in Thailand. The food also is pretty good, though not the best or most interesting I've had.

We had the Ray Rai Nah Phu for appetizer, King Pad Thai, and the Crispy Catfish Salad. The Ray Rai Nah Phu was unique, it was like a salad roll with crab and noodles on it. The sauce on top was delicious, having a coconut curry kind of taste to it.

The King Pad Thai taste like standard Pad Thai, with a bit more tamarind and spices than usual, but overall still very well made and delicious. The presentation was beautiful as well, with the egg looking like a quilted wrap over the noodles.

The Crispy Catfish Salad was good but more standard in taste. It has that spicy lime chile sauce that's typical of Thai places, tasting like a cross between a larb and a mango salad but with fried catfish as the main meat.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Favorite Thai restaurant in the city.

Their green curry is so creamy, so dense, and so flavorful that it renders all other Thai restaurants' green curries dull in comparison like bland and watery soup... It sounded harsh but it's true. In fact, I stopped ordering green curry from elsewhere to prevent disappointment. I usually get it with mock duck but this time I had it with beef. The beef was just okay - a tad hard. The curry itself has always been consistently good.

My friend ordered Krapraw Gai Sub and it was very flavorful. The smell and taste reminded me of one of my favorite home-cooked dish as a kid (青椒炒肉丝). It wasn't as spicy as I had hoped for and a tad salty.

I usually come here for the lunch special, which I highly recommend. Only did dinner once and was disappointed. I might have ordered the wrong thing, but I just remember that the salmon/seafood dish had an odd texture. This was two years ago though.

Have to call for reservations, which can still be a tad difficult to procure. Join Yelp waitlist ahead of time!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"A Thai-me to remember :)

Ordered: (everything was soooo good so I recommend it all)
- Pad see ew: my favorite Thai comfort dish and they did it well!
- beef dish from the privileged section of the menu: unfortunately don't remember the name of this dish but it was very unique and I highly recommend if you like spicy curries! The beef was tender, the flavor was fragrant and the dish included longan (which is like a lychee) and potato chips for texture
- **my favorite dish of the night** moo pork chop: grilled pork lovers unite! The flavor on this pork chop was incredible - so juicy and flavorful (now I want it again). The addition of the coconut sticky rice paired really well with the savory meat

Additional pros:
- the waitstaff is super kind and helpful. They're great about checking in on you even when the restaurant is busy
- complimentary shot glass of soup at the beginning
- interior!!!! Nothing like it, it's cozy and beautiful

Tip:
- long wait so utilize the yelp waitlist!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Sooo pretty! Decor and food presentation are pretty on point - if only the food actually tasted as good as they looked! Some hits, but mostly misses. Service fantastic, so not sure how to rate this. Just overhyped for me for the food

Mango Sunrise ($9): this non-alcoholic mango drink stole the show and my heart. First sip is shockingly sweet, like a mango yogurt drink from the Asian supermarkets, but when the ice melts and it's a littled diluted, wowwwww, SO good. I definitely wanted a second drink. Sweet but refreshing and just delicious

Curry Puffs ($11): comes with four puffs. SKIP because these were so mushy and I swear mine didn't even have chicken. All I tasted was curry potatoes. Almost couldn't finish eating one piece...

Pla Muk Tod - Calamari ($12): couldn't taste the coconut in this dish, but the tumeric color definitely showed. I've had better calamari at the typical Vietnamese restaurants. Not as fried/crunchy as I'd hoped

Tom Juad - Shrimp & Mushroom Soup ($7): soup is supposed to come with crab meat and minced pork but I only had mushrooms and shrimp. Bit bland but the shrimp in the soup is pretty plump and fresh

Gai Hor Bang Touy - Chicken Wrapped in Pandan Leaves ($14): liked the flavors of this one, but is quite greasy despite the fact that it's wrapped in pandan leaves. Basically a chicken meatball

Royal Pad Thai ($24): presentation wise, this looked royal. It's also a really big portion once you cut open the egg net that holds all the noodles together. I think I just don't like overly sweet and salty type of noodle dishes, so I wasn't sold on this. This was particularly sweet; maybe it was because of that and the high carbs that I couldn't finish in one sitting.

And finally, you can pass on the desserts as well. Nothing spectacular

Banana Crepe with Coconut Ice Cream ($12): the crepe is flakey but cooked banana is just too mushy. My own preference, so I didn't like

Mor Khang Brulee with Coconut Ice Cream ($12): favorite of all the desserts, the taro is nice and creamy but very sweet. Coconut ice cream is smooth and good. Portion is made for two-three regular bites",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Best Thai food I've had in the city. Everything here is good. I've never had a bad dish here. I love the chicken wrapped in pandan leaves appetizer. It is so fragrant, juicy, and soft. The eggplant basil and the pad kea mao are also great. I like that there are many meat options for each dish: tofu, vegetables, pork, chicken, mock duck, crispy duck, shrimp, squid. The crispy duck truly is crispy.  The decor is also really nice.

Use the Yelp waitlist feature to avoid having to wait in person!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"My sister and I were hanging out in the city and decided that we really wanted Thai. I looked this place up and decided to try because of the great reviews. First of all, Thai villa is GORGEOUS!! We walked in and were so shocked at how beautifully decorated it was.

We got an appetizer as well as pad see ew and both came out hot, fresh and delicious. We wished we had more because of how tasty everything was. Definitely recommend",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"My sister recommended this place because shes been here before and was a fan of it. I liked I was able to join their wait list on Yelp so we were seated within 5 minutes. We opted to sit at the bar because we had to wait an additional 20 minutes if we wanted a table. The inside of the restaurant is decorated beautifully!

We both ordered the pad thai. My chicken pad thai was absolutely delicious! I loved how it was a little sweet but also tangy especially with lime on the side. For $16, the portion was big and worth it. We also got a shot of butternut squash soup on the house. The soup was an acquired taste and not for me.

The service was also good. The bartender was attentive and friendly. I would definitely come back here again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I finally made it to this amazing restaurant.  This amazing Thai restaurant gets really crowded and they do not take reservations on Fridays and Saturdays.  Plus, reservation are taken only for more than 6 people.  Therefore, I highly recommend that if there is a group make sure that everyone shows up on time or else you will have to wait a long time.  Wait time can go over two hours.  It's a great place to have dinner with a group of friends.  

Food was amazing and service was on point for a very busy restaurant.  While I waiting for my friends, I had the mango sunrise mocktail, which was very refreshing and held me over until everyone showed up.  Once all my friends showed up, we were finally seated.  

Once we were seated, we decided to go family style after observing other diners' main order entrees.  To start we ordered the:

Pak Mor Puk ($9): Vegetable crepe dumplings made up of chives, cabbage, jicama, black mushrooms and bamboo shoots and served with roasted bell pepper-peanut vinaigrette dipping sauce. These dumplings are served in few Thai restaurants and is dish that is served to Thai royal families.  The dumplings are to die for.  I wish there would be more than four dumplings per order, but watching how these dumplings are assembled and made, it's no easy task, hence the price of the appetizer.  

Por Pia Tod ($9): Crispy vegetable spring rolls made up of glass noodles, taro root, shiitake mushrooms and served with plum sauce. These spring rolls were standard and solid.  They come 6 rolls per order.  

Sa Koo Sai Moo ($11): Tapioca dumplings stuffed with minced pork, peanuts and sweet turnips and served with green leaf lettuce.  Another dish that takes a lot of time to make let alone master.  There are five dumplings per order.  These dumplings are the best finger food/bite I have had and there are only a few restaurants that do it correctly, this is one of them.  Definitely worth the $11.  

Spicy Chicken Wings ($14): Deep fried marinated tom yum flavor wings with Thai herbs garnished. These wings are a bit messy but tasty. Unsure if it's worth $14 for 5 wings.  

Chicken Satay ($11): Grilled marinated chicken on skewers, served with peanut sauce, cucumber relish, and grilled brioche. The dish was standard, glad that the dish included the grilled brioche to make is more complete.  The peanut sauce is really good made the overall dish well balanced.  

For the entrees we shared the following:

Chicken with Cashew Nut ($17): Spicy chicken with pineapple, jicama, cashew nut, roasted bell pepper, scallions and chili jam. Served with jasmine rice.  The dish was very good and authentically spicy enough for the Thai American crowd that could handle spice.  

Kaeng Neur Lamyai Bai Chapoo ($27): Braised jarret beef, betel leaves, curry paste, coconut milk and longan meat, served with Jasmine rice.  This dish is not served in many Thai restaurants, but it was definitely worth the price.  The dish had well balanced flavors and the right amount of spice kick which complemented well with the rice.  

We also ordered a side of Steamed Assorted Vegetables ($5), which was a good amount for the price and it complemented the spicy entrees.  

Finally, the dish I have been wanting to try and waited over 10 years is Royal Pad Thai ($24) which is pad thai encapsulated in a crepe.  In this case, this dish is made of prawns, shallots, bean sprouts, chive leaves, peanut bean curd and dried shrimp wrapped in net. The dish is beautifully presented and definitely worth the price because it could feed more than one person.  A one of a kind. Can't wait to go back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"A hidden gem!! Very unassuming from the outside but as you enter the front lobby you are completely transformed into another world, a glimpse into Thailand!

The inside is absolutely breathtaking. We went here during the day but I imagine at night this takes on a whole new life. The booths on the side are carved out intimate areas where you feel immersed but still have a great deal of privacy from others dining.

The menu was extensive and prices were reasonable for NYC. It makes it even more tempting to add on special drinks like the Thai hot toddy or adding a Thai iced coffee to your meal! Everyone in our party enjoyed the food. The only complaint is that we had one meal that took very long to come out, so we felt bad starting without her but also glad we didn't wait as it took a long time. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai here and split a cashew chicken dish as well. I really loved the chicken dish and the appetizer that came with the lunch special was delicious! Everything way fresh and cooked perfectly, not oily or burnt at all. It was a great experience here! I would definitely recommend if you're looking for something off the beaten path.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Service: Spot on. I came in during a busy lunch time without a reservation. With my luck, I was seated at the bar within 20 mins (the expected time they told me). The service at the bar was attentive to each individual that was there.

Food:
Crispy spring roll (v) - Flavor bomb. I enjoy a nice spring roll and I've always noticed that the vegetable one is bland but not this one. The filling was spot seasoned to perfection. The wrapper was crisp from frying without the greasy feeling of it all.

Soup - All mushrooms. It was good but I was not expecting all the mushrooms. A good surprise it was.

Pad See Ew - What you always wanted! The sauce coating all items on the plate. Everything was cooked to perfection! I do have to say that my plate was not presented as beautifully as the person sitting next to me.

On to my next food adventure...",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I love Thai Villa!

If you are around the Union Square/Flatiron are I highly recommend stopping in, especially for lunch when you won't experience a wait. If you are going for dinner, expect a wait and know that you can join the Yelp waitlist!

The service was great - friendly and efficient. I love that they offer great lunch specials for only $14!

A lunch special includes a small appetizer, salad or soup and main course. I opted for the two spring rolls and salad with peanut dressing. Both were great and served on a nice plate. This was a great start to the meal.

Then, I opted for the red curry with chicken and rice. I haven't had curry in a while and it was absolutely delicious! It had the perfect level of spice and a good mix of vegetables. Since it's getting colder in NYC I cannot wait to go back and try other curry or noodle dishes. For $14 this is a great value, especially for the option to dine in a beautiful atmosphere.

As a tip - the lunch special starts at 11:30 so if you can beat the 12pm rush I highly recommend dining in early!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"My friends warned me about the wait for this restaurant, so once it turned 5PM, I went on yelp and added myself on the waitlist. It was only 5:01PM, but I was 19th on the waitlist! However, I think because they just opened then, they were seating people right away because it went very quickly- I was seated right away when I got there!

The restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous. The interior design of this place is amazing, and it has such a cozy atmosphere.

Now to the food- when you sit down, they give you this complimentary butternut squash and coconut milk soup concoction in a shot glass which was really delicious. I also got their thai iced tea which comes in a cute glass milk bottle. Their calamari and pad thai was absolutely amazing too. It is a really good sized portion for the price- I couldn't finish my pad thai because I was so full after the thai iced tea and calamari. However, I really loved that little butternut squash soup they gave in the beginning, so I really would love to come back sometime and try one of their curries! Great food, beautiful restaurant!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Returned last Saturday with a couple of friends who had never been here, and even though it was an overall good experience I feel like some of the food was a bit disappointing this time around.

Started with the Chicken Satay ($11) which was perfect. Came with 4 skewers, chicken drenched in curry sauce and 4 small pieces of toast - delicious. The additional sauces on the side paired perfectly with the dish. As for entrees:

- Khao Soy ($22) - I remembered how much I loved this dish last time, so ordered it again. Unfortunately it was just not the same. Not enough curry broth!! It ended up way too dry for my liking - the noodles were def not soaking in a curry like how they were supposed to.

- Moo-Obb Nam Puaung / Grilled Marinated Pork w/ bok choy and Coconut Sticky Rice ($26) - I was super excited for the coconut sticky rice, but there was almost no coconut flavor or sweetness in it. It just tasted like regular sticky rice... meh. The pork was nicely marinated and tasty though, and I loved that it came with some veggies.

- Royal Pad Thai ($24) - Had this the very first time I came (a couple of years ago) and thought it'd be the safest dish to go with. The prawns were lovely and indeed it was a good entree. We had over-ordered so we were already stuffed when we all got to this dish, but still thought it was good. Made for great leftovers the next day.

Overall, I don't think anything really stood out this time around. Service was great though and because we arrived right around 5pm, we only had to wait about 5 min to get seated under the pretty lights of the main dining area.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Another place stumbled upon while visiting NY.

Was hesitant initially because there didn't seem to be any other asian places near by - so I didn't know if the food would be Americanized. Decided to try because of (1) How packed it was (2) How beautifully decorated it was - and yay glad I did.

Food was not Americanized, very traditional.

Thai Tea was not too sweet and good ratio of cream and tea. Was perfect.

Complimentary soup was so yummy! Had friend garlic pieces floating around which just adds such flavor. Dumplings and spring roll were typical. It was the leek pancake that blew me away. So crispy and flavorful. The pancake was my favorite part of the meal.

Pad Kee Mao was very flavorful, loved that it came with chinese broccoli. I like my tofu crispy, was on the soggy side but still yummy.

Beautifully decorated, fast and friendly service.  The tables are close together but I don't mind, I didn't feel cramped or anything but can see how others would feel that way.

Glad I stopped by, because I love Thai food and was in NY for a while - it hit the spot!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"TV was everything and more. Thank you Sombol for your utmost professionalism and paying attention to me, ensuring the highest caliber of service available.

And perhaps, thank you Corona, for shaving off the wait time from 40 minutes - an hour down to 5 minutes for a single party  of one (myself). I felt very sophisticated, powerful and special. Thank you for this experience. I won't forget it.

Left a 40% tip on the tab with no regrets. Had an absolutely terrific experience that only the serendipity of having this virus outbreak occur, along with the encounter of a stellar waiter/bartender who happens to be friends with an associate of mine, could have offered. Thank you, a hundred times and over",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"We got tips from friends to sign up on the waitlist on yelp beforehand because the wait time can be well over 2 hours. We put ourselves on the list while we were on the train from NJ, about 1 hour before 5pm on a Saturday. Right after we got on the waitlist in spot 18, the time went from 21-30 mins to over 90 minutes. Thank goodness we did it when we did.

Our timing was perfect: we got to Thai Villa just as we were #2 on the waitlist. We came with a party of 3 and barely had to wait 10 minutes before being seated. The staff was friendly, patient, and cooperative.

Onto the food: I know why this place has such a long wait time. It is AMAZING! I don't think I've had better Thai food, and I've eaten a ton of Thai food in my life. The flavors were incredible, the spice level wasn't overwhelming, and the texture of the noodles/tenderness of the meats was in point!

We started off with the calamari and the shrimp cake. It was a good amount of food for appetizers. We decided we like shrimp cake more than crab cake now lol. We ordered a few lychitinees and an old fashioned. The drinks were very aromatic and flavorful! For the main course, two of us got the squid kea mao (drunken noodles), one got the tofu kea mao, and one of us got the royal pad Thai. My mouth is watering just thinking about the food. It was incredible.

We really can't wait to go here again in the future. Our best advice is to get your name on the yelp waitlist atleast an hour before you expect to arrive! And make sure you're at the venue within 5 minutes of that time if not earlier!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I've been here twice and had pretty different thoughts each time. First, the aesthetics here are really beautiful. This place is a perfect date spot. Their menu is quite extensive, so it can be fun to choose some dishes together. Second, my first time coming here I got the royal pad thai which is supposed to be one of their most popular dishes and I really didn't think it was anything special (or worth the 1 hour wait). But the second time around I got their hor mok talay which is Shrimp, Scallops, Squid, Salmon and Crab Meat, Curry Paste, and Heart of Palm served in a Coconut Shell and it was AMAZING.

I am rating 4 stars though because the service was a bit slow and the prices are quite steep for the portion size (you're definitely paying for the ambiance). If anything, I now really want to visit Thailand to try more dishes as it's clear from the very extensive menu that there's so much more to thai food than the standard noodles most people think of. If this place was a bit less of a splurge, I would want to come to try the rest of their dishes.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I ordered their spicy fried rice, unfortunately I couldn't handle that much spices there even though I eat a lot of spicy food. Over all the food was tasteful and sangria was good too.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"This was an amazing venue.  Aside from the aesthetics (wait how can you stop looking around), the food was amazing.

Before I start this review.... reservations are hard to come by? Hmm is it that popular? Will I be waiting on line without a reservation? Nope! They have the Yelp live wait time option. Genius.

The menu was extensive. It was like reading a novel. We ordered several different appetizers and all was amazing.  My fish entree was perfection. It was plated nicely and the taste was great.  

Servers were all attentive and patient with all my questions.

Yes , we like Thai Spicy...
Food came out and it wasn't ""Thai Spicy"", but it was close enough.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Very overrated Thai restaurant. I used the yelp app to be put on the waitlist for 6 pm dinner at Wednesday night for 2 people. I arrived at the restaurant at 7 pm, but was not seated until 7:40 pm. The wait time estimates are pretty inaccurate.

The food overall was standard. Only standout was the curry puffs. Otherwise, the red curry, cashew nut chicken and mango salads were just OK.

Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is the decor and ambiance are exceptional. Very similar to pictures on yelp. I probably will not return.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Thai Villa is one of the best Thai restaurants in New York City, has a great lunch special, and is beautiful inside.

On our most recent visit we went for lunch. The lunch special includes an entree, a soup or salad, and an appetizer. We ordered pad thai and kea mao for entrees with soup for myself, salad for my wife, and crispy spring rolls and fried chive pancakes for appetizers.

The fried chive pancakes are amazing, a must get. The spring rolls are really good too, but the chive pancakes are on another level. The pad thai is always delicious, and the portion for a lunch special is pretty sizeable. The kee mao is also really tasty with a nice spiciness to it. I love the broad flat noodles. This portion was also pretty good for lunch, but it was so tasty I definitely could have eaten more.

Thai Villa is great for lunch or for a dinner date. They are busy, so definitely arrive with time to spare or make a reservation if you can. It is really good food and really great atmosphere. Definitely check it out if you want good Thai food.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Our go to thai restaurant for a few years now since they opened up.... we managed to get an outdoor seating reservation on saturday too!

Krapow gai sub is always on point
Curry puffs are a must with the cucumber raddish dip
The fried crab special was good too
The lychee-tini is my staple drink there
Hubby always gets the thai iced tea

Other awesome dishes: royal pad thai, red curry",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"It was fine. This review is also biased because the first time I had this it did not sit well in my stomach. Could have been me or something on the restaurant's part. My friend felt okay so who knows. Let's dive in...

Vegetarian Options (2/5): Really disappointed by the lack of vegetarian options here (which was listed as a perk according to Yelp...) Almost all the salads had seafood and/or meat. NONE of the soups are vegetarian which sucks when I want a veggie coconut soup. Lots of options in the entres but c'mon, it's not THAT hard to have a basic veggie soup ...

Pad Se Ew (3/5): Totally fine tasting on the way down but I felt sick after eating this.

Por Pia Tod (Veggie Spring Rolls) (4/5): Crunchy, delish sweet sauce. Def recommend.

Pad Thai (3/5): Gave this restaurant a second shot and was disappointed after expectations from other reviews weren't met. This dish was somewhat bland. Not spicy, not enough peanut, not enough sprout, idk just not enough anything.

Pad Krapraw (3/5) (girlfriend's review): Tasted like a normal spicy Thai basil. The bell pepper and onion were thin which was nice and the green beans were the perfect level of crunchy. Medium spice level tasted like the standard spice level of other Thai places. Similar to me the first time, this sat in her stomach for not long before being -- you called it -- expelled...

Price (3/5): Kind of standard manhattan prices for food. But just a couple of dollars more for each dish (especially if you add meat) compared to other places.

TL;DR: Not a fan personally. I am just one review of many so do what you want. I just can't confidently endorse this for anyone.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"This is the best sit down Thai restaurant I've been to, bw Miami, Cleveland, and NYC! Such a beautiful ambiance!!!! And an extensive menu! A lil heftier price tag than the average take out place but the quality of the food speaks to the price.

I had the mock duck with the pad Thai and it was the best pad Thai ever! The mock duck was super good, wanted to try it just cuz it sounded intriguing and def a great option for both vegetarians and meat eaters alike! Not greasy at all and super flavorful dish, and the mock duck was sweet and tangy at the same time. Throughly enjoyed it and worked really hard to finish the fish but the portion was just too large, come hungry!!
I also tried the veggie crepe dumpling which was scrumptious! Definitely ask for chopsticks before digging in or the whole dumpling will fall apart with a fork. I also enjoyed the sauce that came with it.

Drinks here are extravagant and unique! The bai thay w matcha powder and whipped cream was tasty and buzz worthy!

Servers were attentive and helpful with recommendations, even took pics for my group! Overall would def back and I really try to avoid visiting restaurants in NYC twice cuz there's so many more to try!!

PS- the bathrooms are gender neutral and also well decorated and clean!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Went with a group of people to celebrate our co workers last day. It was a Friday evening around 6pm and we were told we didn't needed reservation. As soon as we walk in the place looked kind of full. But we were seated right away.

One thing to note is in the pictures this place looks huge but it's not it has few booths and special seats   But overall it's not too big. Similar to their sala thai location the menu has traditional, street and chef special dishes.

I went with the red curry which was perfectly spicy and had a slight sweetness of bamboo shoots. My friend had green curry which he didn't enjoy much. The Penang curry was top rated but I still preferred my red curry over it. The peach mock tails were bomb sweet and sparkling so juicy and perfect to pair with spicy curry.

Definitely check it out for special occasion or not... they have solid Thai food.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Ordered grub hub today. Wanted Thai, and I work on 19th street. Was in back to back meetings so used grub hub. When our CM Jared gave this place a legit review, I had to give it a try.

Went with the red curry lunch special. It was too much food, even for lunch portions. The curry was delicious, ordered medium spice as ""you never know"". It was barely tingly and I think I can handle hot. Had it with squid, and my-oh-my, gigantic perfect cuts of squid, tender and delicious. Again, really too much. Comes with soup or salad and an app. I do t even think I got to those. You're going to want to ask for chop sticks, they throw in the cheapest plastic ware I've ever seen in my life.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I had such an excellent Valentine's dinner at Thai Villa. Normally they don't take a reservation on Fri-Sun because they will be very busy. This Valentine is on Friday and I decided to try to make a reservation if they will and they do! I did make it a month ahead so when I got to the restaurant that night it was super crowded, tons of people lined up outside. I hardly slipped in to the host table and checked in. The host told me that if I didn't make a reservation I won't be able to get a table tonight!

From the restaurant reputation and suggestion from friends, they have very interesting cocktails and guess what I had three wonderful drinks that night
I like Petchaboon the most, SiSa ket sling the second and the Amethyst the last but they all delicious.

For appetizers we had Rai rai Nah phu, Grilled prawn mango salad. They were great, fresh and right amount. So I have room for main course.

For main we had Ped ron and Pla Lui Suan which is very tasy very easy to eat because they took out of the bone.

For dessert we share with banana crepe

Service is also good and very polite:)

The high light about Thai Villa is how they prepare their food. Every dishe has lots of details like they are performing an art! Their food remind me of the loyal cuisine in Thailand.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"thai restaurant with very modern decor, staffs wears thai style uniform and offers good lunch menu options. came with a party of 6 during lunch time just when it first opened and the restaurant quickly filled out afterwards. Overall a pleasant experience and would come back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"ordered delivery for green curry and the kee mao. both were very underwhelming.

the kee mao had the spicy flavor but no other flavor

the green curry was good, had enough chicken. but the coconut sticky rice was very disappointing. the rice wasnt even thoroughly cooked and was not fresh",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Love this Thai fusion. Came in for lunch and tried their lunch specials with appetizers, and everything was good.
We got the leaf-wrapped chicken, which was grilled and then fried. Dipping it in the sweet sauce was very yummy. Definitely worth the messiness for unwrapping it.
Got a red curry shrimp and a garlic beef. I love both as you really cannot go wrong with garlic and red curry. It's fusion so they got broccoli and such in the dish, expected and delicious, so no complaints.
The sides were less impressive. A little on the oily side and the salad too sweet with the peanut sauce. I like their soup better.
Good service and short wait. Nice decoration and vibes!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I tried Kua Gai for the first time.
That was very good. Broad noodles and chicken are seasoned probably with oyster sauce and soy sauce. That met my taste very much.

They serve Thai cuisine in a casual manner, but the interior seems to be a classical bar. It's interesting. In fact, I enjoyed Asian noodle on a bar table.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"TLDR: Union Square Thai restaurant with a menu serving classic dishes to super unique and elaborate ones too. Killer lunch menu, awesome dinner menu but time your visit. Peak times you will wait. If you live or work in the area, consider yourself lucky - this place is incredible.

So the first time I went to Thai Villa, I was really amazed at the unique offerings available. There are Royal Thai dishes which based on what I read, are dishes reserved for royalty. Sure, I love a good Pad Thai but I did not know WTF Gai Hor Bai Touy was. Fried marinated chicken served in pandan leaves with a sweet savory soy sauce. What??? Yeah, the menu is chock full of dishes that you've never knew existed. While I will say, it can be a bit overwhelming; the staff is very knowledgeable and is happy to explain what the dish is. They also were very helpful in setting my expectations for the flavor profile I'll be getting.

If you're looking for classic Thai dishes, the offering here is solid. The Thai Basil Fried Rice will give you that carby indulgence with plenty of heat. The Pad Thai is even offered in a Royal version. Larger shrimp and beautifully plated, you'll mistake your noodle dish for a pineapple. It comes wrapped in this egg nest which I can't even fathom how this is plated.

Each time I've come back, I've tried something unique. My favorites though were the lettuce wraps with the minced pork and crab and more recently, this curry soft shell crab dish with vermicelli. Their dessert with the blue sticky rice and this incredibly unique ice cream - ugh, so good.

If you come for lunch, it's a half appetizer with soup or salad and your entree. While the portion size is a bit smaller for lunch, it'll be enough food. If you want a classic dish, Thai Villa will satisfy your cravings. If you want to expand your horizons, it'll be plenty of ""I don't know what that was but it's f'n delicious."" If you venture into the Signature/Privileged sections of the menu though - it can get pricey quickly. So just be prepared for that.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Amazing experience! The ambiance is incredible - you feel like you're in a fancy Thai mansion with dim lighting and candles lit in every corner.

Aside from the amazing atmosphere, the food was INCREDIBLE. Boyfriend and I both got the pad Thai and we were so happy with it. Very tasty and the serving size was extremely generous.

The servers were so accommodating, friendly, and thorough. If you enjoy Thai food, this is the place to dine.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Can't express how much I love Thai food! Everything about it is amazing, which is why I'm ecstatic to have found this gem! Beautiful ambiance and ornate decorations. Service is always great even when they are really busy. Nights are the busiest and especially on wknds.

What I love about this restaurant is how exotic some of the food is here with dishes on the menu that I've yet to see at other Thai places. Now let's dive into the good stuff.Here are the dishes I've tried before, needless I say more how this is one of my favorite Thai places.

Papaya salad: fresh shredded papaya, crispy string beans/ tomatoes with a savory chili-lime dressing.

Pla Muk Tod: crispy calamari served with a unique roasted bell pepper-peanut vinaigrette sauce. It was so addictive!

Chicken Satay: delicious grilled chicken skewers which goes really well with this peanut dipping sauce

Pineapple Fried Rice: OMG so yummy! I typically don't eat rice and even I was hooked.

Ped Ron (Crispy Five Spice Duck): crispy goodness, succulent marinated duck served with a rich and creamy dressing. This dish is from their privileged entree menu, which is a bit more pricey, but definitely worth it!

The following dishes are ordered from their SIGNATURE ENTREE section (price on the higher end, but definitely worth it!)

Chilean Sea Bass in Aromatic Coconut Milk: sea bass is roasted with mushrooms and asparagus in a coconut bisque, giving it a unique taste that is quite flavorful.

Kaeng Runjuan: Jarret beef with an amazing array of flavors and ingredients. This dish is superb and definitely one of my favs.

And don't forget to check out their lunch specials! You usually get a choice of cabbage soup or salad, small appetizer and a main course, which is such a great deal! This is what I got:
--Thai salad is refreshing with a savory peanut dressing
--Crispy Spring Rolls was hot, crunchy and tasty
--Kea Mao (Drunken Noodles) with Shrimp was absolutely divine with the perfect amount of spiciness

And for dessert:
Mor Khang Taro with Coconut Ice Cream: taro was warm and soft in consistency, complemented well with the succulent flavors of the coconut ice cream - it was absolutely delightful.

TIP:
-if you can, get there during off peak times so you don't have to wait a long time
-take an uber, subway or bus so you don't have to deal with the horrific parking situation",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Random last minute reservation because we weren't sure how we would celebrate 2:22 . I used Yelp to add me to the 58 min wait list (thanks yelp) got there and only waited about 10 mins for a table (meanwhile the wait for a table was 3 hours and 15 mins smh)

We were greeted by a friendly hostess and escorted to our little table upstairs . The place is super cute . Not big but comfy .

Now to the food .
We ordered some sticky dumplings with shrimp chili's and peanut sauce - AMAZING .
I've never had Thai food like this anywhere .

The main dishes were seafood with some mixed up curry stuff in coconut milk and marinated pork with bok choy and sticky rice .
Please don't ask me what it's called , I just know we ordered off the Chefs Special Menu (this place has 3 different menus)

Everything we had was heaven , even the drinks we good (I stick to bulleit and ginger ale when I don't find anything intriguing on their cocktail list )
The drinks were strong and what makes it even better ?? THE PRICE IS RIGHT .
Real good food , good drinks and our bill wasn't 300 bucks . Great start to an incredible night .
Thanks Thai Villa We'll definitely be back soon .

Here's a pic .",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I think this place mostly gets points for the ambiance. I have to say the food is good, but its not phenomenal. Its typical thai food. I think one of the few things this place can really offer is space for larger parties - which is hard to do in NYC. They will expect you to be right on time and if you are pass their grace period, expect to not be seated. Definitely get on the waitlist (I think you can add yourself on from your phone) or make resos in advance, or you will be waiting a while.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Came here on Friday night after work (5:15pm) for dinner by myself. Got seated at the bar quickly. Place looks beautiful like all the pictures. There are stairs leading upstair (to another floor of more seatings?). Looks very lovely. Menu has 2 sections- traditional classic americanize thai dishes and their local specialty named ""royal"" thai dishes which looks amazing but so much seafood that I'm allergic to.

I stuck with the classic thai dishes; curry chicken puff for appetizers and beef panang curry for my main entree. This panang curry is different as it have sweet potatoes in it (looks like sliced potatoes like fry form). The sweet potatoes help mellow the spiciness for those that can't handle it. I love spicy and could still taste it even with the sweet potatoes. Everything was yummy. I wish I could have order something from the Royal thai section; perhaps if they make it with beef/chicken/pork then I would be fine.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Looking to eat Thai food with a friend, I decided to join the waitlist via their yelp page. It was really simple and if you provide your phone number, they will text you for updates. The wait was around 35-45 minutes in the late afternoon. About 5 minutes until my estimated seating time, they gave a courtesy call to let us know that we are ready to be seated.

Once we got in, we were promptly seated, given menus and water. The service throughout was friendly and attentive, filling up water as needed and continually asking us if we were doing alright. The restaurant is pretty bougie which fits for Manhattan. The menu has a bunch of options and judging from what was coming out, everything looked good. I ended up going with the Royal Pad Thai and my friend went with the five spices duck. When the food came out the first thing that you notice is the presentation. For Thai food, this is probably the best presentation I've seen. Flavor-wise, I thought it was decent compared to some Thai spots that I've had on the west coast. Unfortunately, the prawns came out kind of dry and weren't succulent and juicy as I was hoping for.

This place is pretty expensive for Thai food although probably on par for Manhattan. The lunch options seem pretty reasonable though. Service and ambiance were great, but I can't say that the flavor beats some other Thai places that I've been to.

Ambiance: 5 stars
Service: 5 stars
Food: 3 stars (but 5 stars for presentation!)",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Ordered the Tom Yum Koong and Larb Gai for delivery. Both were pretty good, but the Tom Yum was a little creamier than a normal Tom Yum would be. Also, the only vegetable in the soup is mushrooms which I'm also not used to. That said, it was flavorful and had a good level of spice.

Will definitely order from here again, and try a noodle dish next time.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,Came here with my co-workers during lunch. We had a great experience. The ambience was wonderful and the food was great. I had drunken noodles and thai iced tea.

Thai Villa,"Many Thai restaurants in this city have delicious food and attractive decor, but Thai Villa stands out from the rest. I've dined here a few times and have been very pleased each time.

Note: they don't take reservations on Friday and Saturday evenings and will not seat you until everyone in your party arrives.

Ordered:

Chicken satay ($11): this was a nice sized appetizer with four skewers of chicken, four little triangles of white toast, peanut sauce and a cucumber, onion and pepper relish (it was sweet). I thought this was pretty standard but enjoyable.

Garlic shrimp ($18): this was my favorite dish at Thai Villa. They were very generous when it came to the portion: there was no shortage of shrimp on my plate! There were sautéed vegetables (string beans, zucchini, broccoli, etc) under the shrimp. It was served with rice.

Massaman curry with chicken ($17): this curry had potatoes, onions, chicken, and peanuts. It was served with rice and tasted good.

I'd recommend Thai Villa if you are looking for a Thai restaurant in this neighborhood with nice decor and flavorful delicious food.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"This food is WORTH the wait. Have been here countless times and am always amazed by the beautiful ambiance, attentive staff, and yummy food.

Thai Villa,"I came here for lunch with three amazing co-workers yesterday with our sails set to order from the Yelp Waitlist Secret Menu. Basically, you book your table with their through Yelp Waitlist so you can get in-line remotely from the comfort of your couch, office, bed, gym etc, and when you arrive and let your waiter know, they tell you about their secret menu options, exclusive to Waitlist guests.

Only two of us ended up ordering from the Secret Menu and we both got the noodle dish. It was about $22, and it was massive (could share for two people in my opinion)! My colleague was tougher than I as he managed to finish the whole thing in one sitting. I myself however, was getting ""the sleepies"" and had to waive the white flag (white napkin?) with about 3/4 of my plate remaining. I hate wasting food and since it would be plently for dinner, upon request they kindly packed it up to go for me.

Oh I forgot to mention the space... umn what?! It is gorgeous inside. As soon as you walk in, you're greeted by this really cool waterfall wall feature (I want that in my living room!) and at the same time, you see just how huge this place really is. It kind of reminded me of Ninja a little bit (in Tribeca) in terms of sheer presence. You forget your right in Manhattan, which on a Wednesday, is very refreshing, even if for just an hour.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"3 cheers and 5 stars to finally trying Thai Villa! It's been probably 4 long years of hearing about it, seeing the Yelp page and drooling over photos. Why it has taken me so long to try a well known Thai restaurant a few blocks from my office, I'll never know. But it lived up to the hype!

Came here with 3 coworkers to try out the Secret Menu. (Just add yourself to the waitlist on their Yelp page to get access!!!) Although I didn't actually get one of the dishes from the secret menu, I am forever grateful it brought me through the doors. First of all, can we talk about how dang beautiful this place is? Absolutely stunning from the tippy top with those amazing chandeliers to the tippy bottom. We sat on the upper level so we truly had a view of the entire place.

The Secret Menu looked delicious but I wasn't feeling a very noodlie dish. From the lunch special menu, I got the ginger sautéed vegetables with shrimp and then I added squid for an extra $4. The lunch specials come with a choice of soup or salad (I got salad) and then a variety of appetizers. I opted for the dumplings. They were pretty huge and very tasty. The salad didn't have that traditional ginger dressing that most Japanese, Thai restaurant serve. I love it very much and was bummed that they use a peanut sauce on their salads. It was still very tasty, but nothing compared to my beloved ginger dressing.  The actual dish was INSANE. So incredibly good. The veggies were perfectly cooked eggplant, snap peas, onions and peppers. The Shrimp were delicious and there were so many of them, and the squid was not too chewy. It had a yummy ginger sauce. Just a great dish.

Don't wait 4 years like me, make a res (there was a wait of people I am assuming did not make one) or go during the Secret Menu promotion if you can (the plus is you'll be using waitlist so you can also skip the line!!) just go to Thai Villa.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"A really aesthetic Thai restaurant near the Flatiron! Right when you walk into the restaurant, you're flashed with gorgeous gold decorations. It's on the fancier side of Thai restaurants which I vibe with. I checked in on the waitlist about 15 minutes before I arrived, and we were seated immediately.

There are a lot of choices on the menu. My boyfriend and I decided to go for the Royal Pad Thai and the Hor Mok Talay which was a gluten free curry served in a coconut shell. The pad thai was so ornate and fancy! It was served in an egg net with many garnishes on top that made it look really cool. The taste was 5/5. I asked for extra limes since pad thai tastes so much better with lime juice! The Hor Mok Talay had an interesting texture since it was gluten free. Not my favorite but still tasty and high quality. We also ordered two thai teas and were given a complimentary bowl of dried banana chips and taro chips.

A bit pricey for Thai food, but I guess you're also paying for the ambiance. Solid place!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"My second workday lunch here, much better than the first.

We walked through the typically crowded front area thanks to waitlist, which was also the password that unlocked the secret menu. Two of us tried the noodles, which were terrific and an enormous portion, enough for two meals. (I ate both of mine in one go.) Another got a lunch special from the unsecret menu and it was also great.

Not a fast lunch experience, as I knew from last time; this time I was prepared to savor the beautiful atmosphere.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I only have great things to say about Thai Villa. It's exceptionally beautiful on the inside with elaborate decor.

I don't think it's ever not busy. I've been to their lunch at 11:30am, and the dining room was already busy for lunch and packed when we left.

If you work in the area, this is a great place for a lunch special. It's super reasonable, around $15, and comes with soup or salad, a little bite, and your entree. It's a perfect sampling for a lunchtime Thai craving.

I got the panang curry and I highly recommend it. The spice was perfect and the flavor was amazing. Probably one of the best curries I've had!

Wherever you are in NYC, definitely visit Thai Villa when you can!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Gorgeous and sophisticated interior decor with a high ceiling, dazzling from top to bottom. I came here for a couple of my birthday dinners and the foods and desserts are well presented and mostly authentic. The portions are well sized and their drinks are excellent. Their menu is large and they have wide selection of food ranging from authentic street foods to northern Thai dishes such as my favorite Khao Soi to royal Thai cuisines and more. However their menu does change from time to time. They also have the popular Mango Sticky Rice and it is spot on.

This place does get packed, including their bar seating, so reservations should be made ahead of time. However, if you come right after they open around 5pm to 6:30ish pm on the weekdays, there're plenty of seats available so it's pretty much a walk-in with no reservations required. Unfortunately, the hostess would not seat you unless all members of your party have arrived.

Their restrooms are also very clean and well designed, giving off a nice villa vibe. The waitstaff and hostess are very friendly and efficient. Will definitely be back again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Wow!  This place is incredible!  It's beautifully decorated.  Friendly and attentive service and awesome food.  I left excited to come back for more.

The mocktail with grapefruit and ginger was fantastic.  It looked impressive and tasted even better.  I thought I was drinking a real cocktail- it was just that good!

The food is amazing!!!!
Chicken wrapped in banana leaf- expertly done and great presentation

Thai Villa,"The interior design of Thai Villa is absolutely beautiful, the lighting is perfect and it feels almost as if you're in a mini palace as you walk in. The waitresses and waiters were all very friendly and helpful with questions I had about their menu. Overall I had an alright experience at Thai Villa, the food was definitely delicious, but whether or not it was worth almost a 3 hour wait is debatable. The biggest downside of Thai Villa is most definitely the wait time, my friends and I walked in around 6 PM and we had to wait around 2 hours and 45 minutes to be seated. Another downside was that the place cannot seat a party that is bigger than 7, so my friends and I had to split up for dinner.

The food was better than other Thai food places I have tried in NYC, but it was also more expensive so it makes sense. For starters, my friends and I got the spring rolls and while they were good, I probably wouldn't order them again next time. For my main course, I ordered the Pad Kee Mao and it was very flavorful. If you like spicy food, this dish is definitely for you, you can ask for their dishes to be less spicy if you cannot handle spicy (that's what I did), but the dish is still pretty spicy (so be prepared). I would have liked if the noodle to meat ratio of the Pad Kee Mao was more noodles than meat, but that is just a personal opinion. My friends ordered curries and Pad Thai so I got to try some of that and they were all very good too. Pad Thai that I have tried at other Thai places are normally a little spicy, but the Pad Thai at Thai Villa was on the sweeter side which I enjoyed. If I came back I would probably want to order the Pad Thai.

I definitely enjoyed the food at Thai Villa and I am glad that I went. This is the type of place I would recommend everyone to try out at least one time for the yummy food. I would recommend trying to arrive right at opening times to try to avoid the long waits or get on the yelp waitlist. Something to keep in mind is that Thai Villa automatically charges a 20% gratuity to your bill for parties of 5 or more.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"very cozy Thai restaurant.
I always come here for lunch special.
its more expensive than other Thai restaurant, but their food definitely worth it!
I really like their fried chive pancake. the texture is bit chewy, but crispy outside. very flavorful with soy sauce together.
for main course I got chicken fried rice.
I really like thai style fried rice, it has a unique favor from fish sauce. and chili pepper. with jasmine rice, everything taste super good!

make sure you come here early, because even weekday lunch , alway need to line up as well!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I have been wanting to come to this place for a while. Heard good things and since my friends who also enjoy good Thai food were in town, we decided to go.
It's a beautiful looking restaurant with great service. We came from lunch so it wasn't crowded at all.
However, we all were disappointed with the food. One, everything was too Spicey. Two, everything was way too salty.
Maybe I will give it another try and see if it was just that day.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I love this spot! I've been here multiple times now and it truly gets better each time. The interior decor is incredible, the staff is friendly and the food is phenomenal. The Chilean sea bass and veggie garlic lunch special are my favorite dishes and you have to try the Thai iced tea if you're in the mood for something sweet! The way they plate and present each dish is so unique and adds so much to the overall experience. Excellent restaurant.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Thai Villa,"Overall the aesthetic was was phenomenal
Idk if any other vegetarian felt like this but I was not a huge fan of the food.
IMO it lacked flavor and didn't even have a baseline spice kick  

Also it was a  2 hour wait because they open at 5 and there is no chance to make a reservation online. Interestingly enough, everyone in 2 hour wait time stayed on line",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"The ambiance, the ambiance, the ambiance.

It is so gorgeous inside of this restaurant. I am sure it would make a great date spot. So romantic.

I, however, went with some coworkers and it was great!

The five of us were seated in a large booth that seated us comfortably. The waiter broke down the menu for us, explaining what options were more American Thai food versus actual Thai food.

We placed our order and then a waiter came with a complimentary shooter of butternut squash soup. This warming treat was a really nice way to start our meal.

I ordered the pad see ew, American Thai Food. Sorry, I was feeling hungry and not adventurous. It was one of the best versions of this dish that I've ever had, and it was reasonably priced. I hope to return soon!

My only minor issue with the restaurant was that I couldn't hear the waiter. He spoke quietly and it was a bit loud.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"This place is beautiful inside! I love the ambiance. It's VERY busy on the weekends, so join the Yelp waitlist well in advance. As for the food, I've tried Massaman curry at a ton of restaurants in Queens and even a couple in Thailand, and Thai Villa's Massaman curry was the best I've ever had. The Khao Soy chicken thigh dish was terrific as well.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

As we walked into the dining room we were struck by the beautiful decor. Within seconds we were greeted by our server (shout out to Dan!) who was able to recommend delicious dishes and answer all of our questions. All in all we had wonderful experience here and will be back!

P.S prices were very fair and comparable to others thai restaurants.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Pros
- attentive waiters
- free appetizer
- beautiful decor

Cons
- tight space
- not sure if they do reservations I've only ever been able to do the waitlist",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The food here never disappoints.Very tasty and fresh.The service is impeccable.The appetizer that comes in the beetle leaves is yum.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Thai villa is beautifully decorated and the photos don't do it justice! The waterfall over the Buddha face in the front when you enter- just wow. The food is delicious too, but I knocked off a star because the rice I had last night was undercooked and a bit chewy. We thoroughly enjoyed the tom yum goong with shrimp (6 nice sized shrimps in the bowl portion), vegetable mushroom soup, chicken flat broad noodles, basil fried rice, and spicy papaya salad. The vegetables with peanut sauce was just ok. The food came out quickly on a packed Wednesday night around 8:30pm.

The prices are typical of Manhattan flatiron. For three entrees (2 veggies, 1 chicken), a papaya salad, a bowl of soup, a cocktail, and a cup of soup, it was about a hundred bucks for the three of us. The service is great of course - attentive waitress who refilled waters, cleared off plates. Booth was comfy and each dish plating was done with care. Husband enjoyed his tamarind old fashioned.

Would I come back here again? Sure, if there was a short wait. we were on the yelp waitlist for an hour on a rainy week night. Overall good filling portions, lovely decor, quick wait staff, and yummy Thai food!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"It was a Saturday evening and we waited in line for two hours. Our rightly one of the best Thai restaurants we have been to! The ambience and food, both are excellent.
The portion size is quite decent.

Kha Nom Jeeb (Vegetable dumplings) - the dumplings were nice and big. Pretty tasty. The dumplings are served with soy sauce but do not miss out on the sweet chili sauce served along with it!

Thai salad - I have had better Thai salads. The salad was tasty but nothing extraordinary

Basil fried rice - A must try at this place! Loaded with veggies and basil, it's not too oily and yet melts in your mouth

Kea Mao - I loved Kea Mao(drunken noodles)! We asked for spicy and it surely was! Excellent quality of noodles loaded with tofu and fresh vegetables. The plate looked small when it arrived but I was full by the end of it

Massamun with jasmine rice - I'm not a big fan of sweet curries with jasmine rice but the massamun here definitely changed my mind. A little sweet in the beginning with a spicy taste towards the end, this plate is a must try!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"This place was nothing short of amazing. I ended up calling Thai Villa abruptly just an hour or so before they closed. Neither me or my girlfriend has ever dined there before. They told me they can indeed secure a table for us even though it was short notice. My lady and I actually had a prior reservation at another restaurant across town, but we were waiting for over 40 minutes there to be seated so we decided to leave. They seemed too busy.

Once we got to Thai Villa, the wait was very brief and they took me and my girlfriend to a table located upstairs in a semi-private balcony with just one other table in that area. That worked out beyond magically because I planned to propose to my girlfriend at the end of dinner! The semi-privacy of the balcony created the romantic atmosphere I needed.

Our server, Dan, was the best ever. He was kind, attentive, helpful, and nice. He answered all our questions regarding the menu and even gave us some helpful suggestions. The food was immaculate! Our appetizers and entrees were scrumptious and filling. The drinks we had were equally just as good as the food. 10 out of 10!

At the end of dinner, I asked Dan to subtly record my proposal to my now fiancée to which Dan agreed. She said yes! Thank you Dan for capturing a life moment.

Thai Villa will now become a regular go-to place where my fiancée and future wife will return to regularly to enjoy top-notch food and service while re-living a magical moment that will remain with us forever.

Huge gratitude to Dan and the rest of his team at Thai Villa. You guys are spectacular!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Such a beautiful Thai restaurant! This is definitely an instagrammable place. Thank god we put ourselves on a waitlist about 2 hours before we actually sat down (even on Wednesday). service was very attentive, price was reasonable and atmosphere was amazing. their food can be little too sweet or salty, but outside food is going to be always like that, so what can I say? Also, one time we ordered from this place to my place (midtown east) and delivery was pretty fast too.

I would absolutely come back soon!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Honestly, maybe I went during a bad time or ordered the wrong things, but wasn't really sold on anything special here.

Granted I am gluten free and don't eat pork, but typically give in to soy in these circumstances which opens up the menu for me. I had 2 lunch specials one day with my mother and the spicy chicken salad. Loved the red curry with beef, and the pad thai with beef was okay. Spicy chicken salad was nothing special either.  Truthfully I should have known that ordering the lunch special is never the move, and that is universally true, but the pricing was good and we picked a menu from the regular item to pair it with.

The restaurant is beautiful and location impeccable. The lighting certainly brings out some outrageously pretty shots of the food and I really liked the designs on the floor and walls. Bathrooms were nice.

The service was good, nothing insane. Hostesses in the front were nice and helpful and the waitress, despite broken English, was accommodating.

Overall, I'd say 7/10 type place but I think i might have to go back given all of these insane reviews on here. I really only eat Thai food on special occasions and like to really indulge but I think holding back a little might have tampered with my experience. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the Red Curry a great deal just really wish the portion of protein in each of the dishes was for more substantial. I hold true to my belief that I should go back, but am confident enough in my only experience to rate it as such. I don't think my 3 stars will severely impact how this place is viewed anyway just sharing some thoughts.

All love",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

I met TK who was very knowledgeable about the food and he made recommendations for me about food I ended up ordering. ""TK"" thank you for the talking me into the Roast duck with red curry. It was just heavenly. Loved the friendliness of the entire team. Fried banana with ice cream was delicious. Loved the black coffee too. I will be definitely returning to eat here next time I am in New York. ""TK"" thank you again for the outstanding service!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Thai Villa redefined Thai food for me. It was fresh, flavorful, and packed with spices and herbs! There are a lot of reasons why you should come here.

1) The Atmosphere - This place is hella romantic and really gorgeously designed. I love the gold heart chandeliers, the candles, and the overall design. Though they really packed people in, it never felt crowded outside of the waiting room.

2) The Service - I am someone with a bad mushroom allergy, fish allergy, and shellfish allergy. Because of this, most Asian food is off limits to me. I can usually find a few things to pick from on the menu, but it always feels super limited. When I mentioned my allergies to the waitress she was extra accommodating! She took the time to break down what I could and could not eat, and confirmed with me the whole time. Since everything is made fresh, it also meant a lot more was able to be chosen from as they could just omit fish sauce or mushrooms. She also made sure my cup was never empty. Great service from everyone.

3) The food - oh my god! Where do I begin? We split the chicken satay and that was a huge win from the start. Their peanut sauce was amazing and the chicken was perfectly seasoned with turmeric and other spices I probably don't know the names of. For my entree, I went with the Basil Eggplant with beef. My partner got a noodle dish that I'm blanking on the name of. Both of them were heaven on a plate (though mine was way better as evidenced by the photo of her stealing from my plate while my camera was eating. We also went with the trio of sorbet and it was so fresh and delicious. You can really tell that everything is made fresh with real fruits and vegetables. I absolutely loved it.

4) The wait - So Thai Villa was on our list to try for a while, but when I saw they were on Yelp Waitlist I jumped at the chance to go. We hopped on the line while I was still at work, arrived and checked in. While we still had a bit of a wait once we arrived (10 or 20 more minutes), it was better than the 2-hour wait we heard them quoting couples walking in off the street. Made everything so much more convenient and accessible.

Highly recommend going here! I made the lucky mistake of coming once and now I know my girlfriend will want to come again and again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Upscale and beautiful! When we got there around 6 PM, we were told that there would be a 45 minute wait. We went on a walk around the area and were notified via text that our table was ready.

The interior was astoundingly beautiful! Golden decor pieces hanging from the ceiling shimmered in the dark lighting and intricately carved wooden panels separated the different sections of the restaurant. We were seated in the upstairs area and had a great view of the downstairs.

The service was top notch. Waiters brought us a small appetizer that I found to be extremely unique. We were served cubes of watermelon that were topped with dried fish crumbs. An interesting combo that surprisingly worked! Waiters also brought us wet towels to clean our hands with. Our entrees were prepared extremely quickly and were served before our drinks!

[ The Amethyst ] I loved the frothy texture and would recommend this to someone who likes lightly sweetened drinks.

[ Pad Se Ew with Vegetables ] The price of the dish varies depending on whether you get vegetarian or protein. I really enjoyed the sweet and salty flavor of the dish but it was almost a little too salty. There was a good amount of vegetables mixed in with the noodles.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I have so many good things to say about this place I don't even know where to begin. First off, it has a beautiful interior design and the ambiance is really pleasing. It made me want to stay longer and eat more. The amber color chandelier created a dim golden lighting. This is perfect for all occasions..bring a date, group of friends or family!! If you go

The dishes are all delicious. If you like Thai cuisine, you must come here! I've been to this place 4 times. Each time I order something different and I have never been disappointed. My favorite is the larb gai salad (spicy Thai chicken salad) and chicken with green curry. The staffs are all really attentive and nice.

Also, they do not take reservations for dinner on Friday and Saturday. So expect to wait up to 1 hour if you choose to go during those times. Usually, if I go on weekdays, we get a table right away.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Thai Villa is one restaurant in New York that I would recommend to everyone. The amazing service, delicious and not too pricey food, and beautiful restaurant are the perfect combination for any dining experience.

My friend and I dined here around 2 pm on a Saturday afternoon and we were seated immediately. TIP: make sure you check there hours because they close during the day before dinner. We ordered a lunch special that came with a small soup or salad, choice of appetizer, and entree for around $13-20 depending on the entree. I ordered a salad, vegetable egg rolls, and a rice and chicken dish for only $13. That is an amazing price for a nice restaurant like this in the middle of New York.

The service was also spectacular. Our waiter was very attentive, our glasses were never empty and our food came out very fast. On top of the this was probably the most beautiful restaurant in New York that I visited. I would eat here just to stair at the golden trees and beautiful seating booths.

If you are craving Thai Food and want to experience a nice, beautiful, and not too expensive restaurant Thai Villa marks the spot!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"This place has it all. Flavour, vareity, ambiance and service . This is a perfect thai place if any one asks for recommendations in Manhattan.

My personal favorite is their mango salad with shrimp. They have an appetizer with some cramp and noodles wrapped in leaves it tastes good for one who likes some sweetness in their food. Their cocktails do give you a tingle to your taste buds .
For mains we went for the classic The classic red curry which didn't disappoint at all.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Possibly the best Thai place in Manhattan proper not just because the ambiance is lit but also that authentic Thai menu. I'm in love. And they change it up quite often. You know when you walk into a Thai restaurant and the first sense you encounter is the smell of fish sauce that this will be good. And then the glowing leaf chandelier is just a nice touch.

They have all the traditional American Thai food alongside a fabulous, ever changing, hard to find Thai menu that I usually end up ordering from. The papaya salad is pretty close to the Som Tom I've eaten in Thailand. I've tried multiple times to find the one since I came back from Thailand and this is probably close to the best (outside of Queens).",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Thai Villa,"I've had Thai Villa bookmarked for a while - it periodically crosses my Yelp feed and one of my colleagues has been there multiple times with nothing but great things to say about it. My experience with Thai food has been really limited, and because of all the amazing things I've seen and heard from Thai Villa I made it a mission to try it out. My mission was completed when my colleague and I planned a lunch here.

Located in the Flatiron District, Thai Villa is a very popular restaurant. I've read here waits for a table can be over an hour, and in order to be fair they don't accept reservations on Fridays and Saturdays for dinner. We decided to opt for a Sunday lunch both to secure a reservation and to not be too bombarded with crowds. We arrived at noon which was right when they opened so we were greeted with an empty restaurant, though it quickly filled up.

I know it goes without saying, but the decor was stunning - lots of intricate wood coupled with accents of gold, reds, and an impressive water feature out front; it was over the top without being tacky. I couldn't stop looking around - the aesthetics were a total yes.  

Since it was my first time, our server explained the menu to me. One section has starters and entrees that one would find at most Thai restaurants, while another section contained more specialty, ""privileged"" entrees (and I assume more authentic). I was going to take full advantage of my visit and honed directly in on the latter section.

We decided to start with the Mieng Kum which were lettuce cups filled with coconut, pepper, shrimp (I think) and other things. They were pretty good - the leaves were super raw looking and the filling looked kind of dry but it really came together when you ate them together (which is what we were told to do). Nice mouthfeel and good flavor. For my main I had the Goong Ma Kham - ie. shrimp with tamarind sauce. This dish was really good - the shrimp were huge and the sauce had great flavor. It came with a side of jasmine rice which helped since the sauce was on the thin side. The dish had a number of accents but all the flavors worked together really well.

Service was great - everyone was really friendly and our food came out at a great pace. Overall, I was super impressed at Thai Villa - the aesthetics are amazing, the food is great, and the service is a yes. My first journey into authentic Thai was a success, and I would definitely return to explore more of their menu.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Beautiful place for slightly upscale but still affordable Thai! (their lunch special includes an appetizer and soup or salad with an entree, for the price of just that entree). We came to celebrate my mother's birthday and it was the perfect spot for the occasion. We ordered

+ vegetable crepe dumplings (wrapped in purple rice noodle, looked and tasted great)
+ curry puffs (I liked this the most of everything we ordered)
+ penang curry (a bit too salty for my liking)
+ royal pad thai (wrapped in a crispy egg batter. I liked that it was not too salty or sweet, as pad thai's sometimes tend to be)
+ mor khang taro (a taro cake served with coconut ice cream. In yelp photos and according to the waiter when I asked, this is bruléed. However, it was not served that way, which disappointed me, and the portion size was tiny. Still tasted good -- the coconut ice cream was the star of this dessert)

You should definitely join the Yelp waitlist before coming, as there is bound to be a long wait. We came only 30 min after opening, but still had to wait around 15 min.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Had an impromptu  lunch date with my bestie who only eats Italian food so I knew I had to bring her to a gorgeous restaurant to try a new cuisine! I've read about their lunch special on Yelp before and never made it into the area at the right time to do it til now!
The lunch special menu is awesome. You pay based on protein ($13-17) for a soup or salad, an appetizer & an entree! We both got the house salad with the yummiest peanut dressing. She opted for edamame and I got the dumplings that were soooo yummy. For entrees she got the sauteed beef in peanut sauce in the first section of entrees (maybe Pakaran... sorry lol) and I got the Massaman Curry with shrimps. Absolutely delicious! We had such a nice time  and I got a pot of beautiful blooming tea that they didn't charge me for ! They even let us sit after warning us the kitchen was closing for the staffs lunch break. We'll totally be back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"The best Thai food in NYC is found at Thai Villa, that is an indisputable fact.

I came here one fateful Sunday with my sister, boyfriend, and dad and even though all four of us have wildly different taste buds and food preferences we ALL unanimously agreed that the food at Thai Villa was extraordinary (mind you, we each ordered different dishes, so this conclusion is based on an assessment of FOUR different meals and all four hit the mark).

I won't write a lengthy review because I just don't think it is necessary. If you love Thai food you MUST go to Thai villa, period. Trust me, you will love everything about this restaurant: the beautiful decor, the ambiance, the fast and attentive service, the ridiculously DELICIOUS food, the desserts... everything is top notch.

I enjoyed the tamarind duck and eggplant dish that I got that evening so much that I went back to Thai Villa and ordered the exact same dish two days later for lunch. Let that serve as my fair warning that the food here is addictive.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"So we came here to check what the hype is all about. Coming in I was amazed right away with their decorations but my mood changed right away with my encounter with the lady in the front. It was President's day, a holiday so it was a little busy. I put my name in the waiting list through yelp so I told her about it. She said she couldn't find my name so she asked me for my number. My mistake was I put my nickname, so I apologized to her. But then I heard her say something under her breath ""that's what it is."" First of all, she doesn't smile, she doesn't greet nicely, I don't know what she's doing in the front, too rude to be in that spot.

Anyway, food is ok. The marinated pork is very tender and tasty, my daughter loved it, but $26 for pork? The royal pad thai is nothing special for $24, my friend said Obao's pad thai tastes so much better. We also got the shrimp and squid with duck egg yolk. My friend's mouth was on fire after accidentally eating one of the seeds that pop out of the green chili, it was that spicy so be very careful!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Amazing restaurant! I fInally got to try it on a weeknight and yes I did wait around an hr and a half  to 2 hours, but the food and drinks made up for it. I mean the decor already was fabulous. The mango sunrise drink is sooooo good. The menu is thick but it's very cute with their logo on front. I got the panang curry and I tried their wings and calamari. All were really good. The friends I came with also thought the restaurant was beautiful and can't wait to go back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"4.5 stars - SO PRETTY. Imagine the golden Beauty and the Beast Ballroom as a Thai restaurant and you've got yourself Thai Villa! This place has a damn gorgeous golden aesthetic and I'm all for it. My friend, who has been here multiple times, recommended for me to try coming here after our amazing trip to Thailand and honestly, I walked in this place skeptically.

I ordered the Green Curry with Tofu/Veggies ($13) and my friends ordered the Red Curry, Panang Curry and Paid Thai for their weekday lunch special. Depending on which protein you choose, you can pay ($13-$17). The deal also comes with a soup/salad and an appetizer of your choice (veggie spring roll/chive pancake/steamed pork and shrimp dumpling/edamane). My friend also ordered a Thai Iced Tea, which was pretty good but was $5!! I truly miss my 30 baht thai iced teas but what can I do...  The portions were also relatively small in American standards but were definitely similar to Thai portions. As for the taste, PRETTY GOOD. My green curry had a two star in terms of spice and I can confidently say that it is NOT FOR THE WEAK (and I'm no coward when it comes to spice). My friend, who ordered the two star Panang Curry, struggled with the spice so definitely watch out if you are a baby in terms of spice!

The service here was spectacular. The servers were kind and checked up on us often. They asked us how the food was and our glasses were never empty. After we finished our meal, we also stayed around to chat for awhile and we were not rushed at all. Wonderful!

Overall, I can definitely see myself coming back. At Thai Villa, I definitely think you are paying $$$ for the ambiance. However, with their affordable lunch special menu, there is an option for the boujee or poor folks like me!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Always have a great time at Thai Villa! They served refined contemporary Thai cuisine with a modern twist, royal pad Thai is a must try! Also recommend fried calamari so delish!!

This interior is so beautiful !! All the golden leaves hanging from the ceiling with  classic south Asian decoration. Very insta friendly !  Our server is nice and sweet, always checking on us make sure we enjoy our dining experience. Def will come back !

Ps : they do walk-in but for large party please make reservation at least one week ahead.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Really enjoyed dinner here, ambience was incredible and food was tasty. Sign onto the Yelp waitlist early because they don't take reservations on Fri/Sat night and the wait can be long. We put in our name for a table of 4 at 6pm on Saturday and were seated at 8:30 (estimate had said 9:30, an hour sooner than expected was great!).

One of our group was vegetarian, and there were many great options to choose from. Everything was delicious - the shooters of soup they brought when we were first seated,  the vegetarian dishes, the meat dishes. We did order a spicy dish or two and said we were fine with lots of heat, but nothing was really spicy.  Some Thai restaurants get pretty hot, but this place was more on the sweeter side. We ended up doing family style 4 apps, 5 entrees, and a bottle of wine, and the total was about $50/ person before tip, which was pretty reasonable.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"TL;DR pretty decorations, order drinks, order appetizers, don't order the  royal pad Thai, make a  reservation or use yelp waitlist.

Thai Villa is a fun restaurant to go to. It is elaborately decorated which makes for a great atmosphere for a date or a birthday/anniversary dinner. It's also great to go just because which is what my friend and I did. We went on a weekday evening, around 7 or so, and it was packed. The wait was 30 minutes for 2 people but I heard some people with larger parties being quoted an hour wait. I would suggest you make reservation for dinner as this is a very popular location. You can also put your name down on the yelp waitlist.

The food was good overall. I really liked my cocktail, which was a lychee martini. My friend and I ordered the leaf wrapped chicken, the spicy chicken wings, and the grilled prawn mango salad as appetizers. We really enjoyed all of the appetizers and had high expectations for our main entree. We ordered the Royal Pad Thai to share as our main dish and were disappointed. I had seen in other yelp reviews that the Royal pad Thai was not great but it looked so amazing when we saw the table next to us get their order and we ordered it anyway. It was beautifully plated but the overwhelming flavor was sweetness without very much tang or spice. It was fine, but I wish we had gotten a different entree item. Overall I would make another trip to Thai villa because the atmosphere was great, as was the service, and 3/4 of the food we tried was amazing. I will be sure to try a different main dish next time.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Excellent service. BEST was our waiter, so attentive and very kind. Our food was delicious. The lunch specials are a great deal: small app, soup or
Salad, and an entree. The entree portion is huge, but delicious nonetheless. We love coming here it's one of the best Thai places in nyc.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Honestly, When I come to the restaurant, I am already very tired and hungry, and I am really angry bc this restaurant fails us. I reserve before 30 minutes, and wait 30 minutes for the dishes. We order 3 dishes: basil fried rice, royal pad thai, and the papaya salad. The salad come first, and it is too salty. We try the first bite, and return it immediately. The royal pad thai and fried rice is too normal. I try a lot to eat the fried rice bc it is oily.
I am a fan of thai dishes, I try a lot of thai restaurant in the state and in thailand. Honestly, this restaurant is the worst.
$52 for 2 dishes  + 10usd tips. It is not worth it, and I dont know why people hype this restaurant :(. Waste time and money.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"This place gets pretty busy, so I'd recommend reserving if you're planning for a weekend! I reserved about 2 weeks in advance for lunch on a Saturday and had no problems. Can't speak for weekdays though.

Thai Villa is cozy and beautiful on the inside. I was a fan of their decor and soft lighting. We were seated on the second floor in a corner with a bench, which was fine for me but a bit tight for my brother - we were a little close to the two people dining next to us, but ultimately it wasn't bad. The dining area is actually overall quite large and can accommodate many parties of 2-5.

They don't offer lunch specials on the weekends, but the prices are quite reasonable. The menu has a pretty good spread of standard Thai food and some items that I have not seen at other restaurants before, which seems more authentic. I had the chicken Kua Gai, and we also had the betel leaf/peanut appetizer, which were all quite tasty. The kua gai is easy on the stomach but still flavorful, and the appetizer was fresh - I'd definitely eat both again. We also received a complimentary appetizer of various root vegetable chips, which was nice.

Our server was polite and attentive despite how busy the place got (totally packed with a wait at 1pm on a Saturday). They are quite professional, and our food came at a good pace so we didn't have to wait too long between our appetizers and main courses. I'd like to try their desserts and when I'm back.

This will be a go-to for casual dates! Looking forward to the next time.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"This is my go to restaurant since it's just a few blocks away from my office. They do delivery, pick up and sit down so you have all your options so you have no excuse to check this place out!

Their restaurant interior is beautiful and gets packed during peak lunch/dinner hours so be sure to make a reservation. My go-to order is chicken pad thai and thai iced tea, very basic I know. But they really know how to make a solid dish that's so common, so delicious.

Also would recommend their curry!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"By far my favorite thai restaurant in New York City! The pad thai is sweet, salty, and saucy. Just the way I like it. All the other dishes are unique and offers a surprise every time I visit.

I would also recommend their wings! It's just the right spice.

For dessert, I highly recommend the coconut icecream and hot taro mix! Delicious.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Probably the best Thai place I've ever been to (though I haven't been to Thailand itself yet...)! The line was pretty long on a Saturday night - make sure you use the early Yelp sign-in. Lines moves fairly quickly but we were told to arrive around 6:45 and were seated finally around 7:15.

The food was fantastic! Absolutely blew me away. We ordered chicken pad thai, pad kee mao (drunken noodles) and basil fried rice - all three were full of flavor and delicious. The drinks were strong and tasty as well. We got the SiSaKet Sling (passionfruit cocktail) and the Amethyst and enjoyed both.

I would definitely return, line or no line! It was worth the wait.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Came here a bit before peak hours so we didn't have to wait to be seated. Immediately walking in I was amazed by the decorations, though it was a bit hard to see due to the dim lighting. Excellent service - staff were really friendly and recommended several dishes to us as it was our first time there. We ordered the fish salad, braised beef, five spiced duck, green curry, and thai teas. The seasoning was on point but some dishes could be slightly less salty and the braised beef was actually spicy. Thai tea was up to par - smooth and not too sweet. This place is a bit on the more expensive side but I would be down to come back to try their other dishes given the quality and service.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Delicious Thai food. I was starving, so I ordered more than i could eat. But it was amazing because I got to sample the veggie pad Thai, tom yum (the winner of the order), papaya salad, and red curry with sticky rice. Even more legit, the sticky rice came in a banana leaf (we think it was a banana leaf).  The flavors were vibrant and well-balanced; and the ingredients were fresh and well-prepared. I look forward to our next order and finally a visit someday!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Tried coming here once during dinner service on a weekend and quickly turned back after being hit with over an hour wait. This time around, arrived during opening hours at 5pm on a Saturday - still a line, but was immediately able to get a table for two.

Interior is as lovely as the pictures had shown - decorated well without being overbearing. Immediately after sitting down, was handed the menus where they explained all the sections in great detail. Didn't want to overindulge ourselves, so settled on just entrees. Before getting the food, they served a watermelon starter sprinkled with dried seafood. Interesting contrast that got the appetite going. For the main course, ordered the ""Ped Ron"" ($28) - a large marinated crispy half duck served with tamarind sauce, eggplant slices, and white rice. Duck is surprisingly meaty, as most places only give you a small quantity. Eggplant absorbed the tamarind well, altering the flavor in a good way.

Overall enjoyed the meal and the quick service. Probably wouldn't wait in line to get here, so if you're lucky and there is no wait, a good spot for dinner.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Love this thai restaurant!!! I've already been twice here and both times it was a great experience. The food is very good and portions are big! My favorite is the pad thai. The place is so nice! Better to be seated downstairs. There's always a huge waiting line, both for lunch and dinner, so you should probably put on waitlist through yelp before going.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"So this place is beautiful, yes but that's about it.

I got take out from here and my oh my was I disappointed.

I always get Pad Se-Ew but when I got it from there man it was so sweet it was basically inedible. They also don't have the best service at the host stand. Yes I get it, they get busy and it can be stressful but they still have been pretty rude the two times I got take out and the one time I attempted to dine in.

I think this place is just beautiful and overhyped and that is about it.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"A beautiful restaurant near Union square that our friend introduced us to. There was a bit of a wait for a table for lunch but that's expected since Thai Villa's decor is beautiful, service is great and food is amazing. The only downside was that they didn't have high chairs for children which meant having to keep our baby in our lap and try and eat lunch which was not the most comfortable but given the small amount of space there is between the tables, there wouldn't be any space to keep a high chair.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

The food itself was also very good. I loved the pad thai I ordered but it was definitely on the pricier side of thai food especially in the city. If you're coming with a group, you have to all be there or you won't be seated. And it gets very busy here (especially on weekends) so make sure you try and beat the rush.

If you love thai like I do, this is a MUST try place!!

It's kind of tucked away and hidden under the construction awning, but the inside is HUGE and elaborate.

Looks like there's usually a line during peak lunch and dinner times, or just most of the time. Can potentially be seated right away at the bar area.

Their drunken noodles are delicious, and so is everything else.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Went here for dinner last night and I am already looking forward to coming back. Got there around 630 and was given an hour to hour and a half estimated wait time. The table ended up being ready in 15 minutes which was awesome. Love the yelp waitlist tool.
For appetizer we got the veggie dumplings. My friend and I split the traditional pad Thai and sea bass for our main course. Both were delicious!
Our servers name was  Best and he was really great. Highly recommend.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Thai Villa is possibly one of the most impressive, insanely decorated restaurants that I've had the pleasure of eating at: definitely a place to feast all of your senses. Tables on weekend nights fill up extremely quickly, possibly because everyone wants to eat under shiny golden tree leaves. They don't take reservations on weekends so if you're in a large group and you want to just walk in, I recommend being the first in line and resigning yourself to a 5 pm dinner.

That said, the fare was pretty standard for Thai food (and one of the plates we ordered was fried calamari). The puff pastry with salmon was delicious but wished the actual size of the pastry was a tad bigger. I loved my tofu/vegetables in ginger dish (though the presentation looked a bit lopsided and sloppy) and everyone else wiped their plates clean.

Best thing we ordered was the dessert, which I don't actually see on the menu. It was some kind of amalgamation of sticky rice, condensed milk, red beans, coconut ice cream (which was near impossible to actually scoop up with a spoon, it was so hard), shreds of jackfruit, and toast. Very strange combination but actually tasted delicious.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I found out about Thai Villa through some colleagues.

They have a great lunch special with plenty of app & entree options at a really affordable price. I've gone in mostly with a large group and haven't had any issues being seated right away (no reservation). Of course, I have to mention the service is always ON POINT!

My personal fave to grab for lunch is Pad Sew Ew, typically, I'll ask for it a bit spicy. They will pack the heat on there, if you ask, unlike some other inauthentic spots.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Not all that glitters is gold. Sometimes it can be more valuable, like platinum or diamonds... but not in this case.

The two main draws for Thai Villa is for the stunning interior decoration and the cheapass lunch special. $15 in this part of town? Yes please. Other than that, the only other appeal is the serenity of taking a shit in a pimped out bathroom-- which also falls under interior decoration, but still.

On both occasions I've come here, the food was rather ordinary and lackluster. Drunken noodles and pad see Ew were ok. I can't really expect everything but I do value food over atmosphere. Other people don't, so take it at your own face value. The person I came with remarks that the spice isn't very spicy... or spicy at all.

I'd recommend coming during evening hours, where presentation matters more. But for me that takes away the appeal of an affordable meal.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Cuisine: Thai food
Atmosphere: thai and asian design/ decor. Cozy space with dim lighting, which makes it perfect place to take a date or having a date night.

Food: thai cuisine. The plating are very beautiful, portion size is great to share, thai food is much more on the sweeter side, but good. If you dont like sweet thai food, this might not be your place. The desserts are great. I wished i could have tried all the desserts, but too full to do so. Con: long wait line for friday and saturday, as they dont take reservation on those two days of week. Also there is only two bathrooms; the line can be a bit long. There are reservation available, except Friday and Saturday. The general wait time is approximately 1.5 hour. There is a little seating area, but space is limited. Another option is leave your number and they will text you when your table is ready.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"A beautiful restaurant, perfect for a small group event or date night. Lunch would be even better, as it can get really crowded for dinner. However, we got in with little wait time by arriving promptly when it opened.

I love the gold décor of the place. It feels very fancy but authentic enough. I loved the curry puffs appetizer, and my favorite dish was the Panang Curry with tofu, followed by Basil Fried Rice and then the Pad Thai. The Pad Thai was a bit sweet for my liking, but I asked for the chili garlic sauce to adjust to my spice levels.

Service was quick; our waters were filled very frequently, which I appreciate a lot at Asian restaurants! Overall a great experience, but it seems you pay a little more for the scenery, while I would rather have more authentic-tasting food. It's definitely still worth a visit.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I got the royal pad Thai when I came to this establishment a couple months ago.  It was very well decorated and had a strong sweet notes will enough vinegar to make you notice it. The dish came out lukewarm, but I did not expect it to be piping hot.  We had a table of 10 and timing dishes is an issue with any group this big.
The ambiance is nice.  It is decently decorated but not overly fancy.  There was a nice hum of chatter in the restaurant background.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Thai Villa,"This place is so beautiful! I recommend going here for any special event. Be aware it is hard to get reservations if you don't plan ahead! I called them a few days ahead but we couldn't get any since we were a party of 9. So we decided to go with it and get to the restaurant early and hope to get seated. It was risky but worth it. In the end, we were able to get seated once our entire group arrived. Service was really fast and we were just in awe of the beauty and decor around us. I felt like we were dining in luxury. Lol

As for the food, I got red curry with chicken. I thought the portion was decent for the amount I paid. While my red curry was very tasty and creamy, I kept comparing it to my favorite red curry. In my opinion, while this shop had tasty curry it's not my favorite. We also got drinks and oh my... these were very strong. I swear mine was just all alcohol but I'm sure others would've loved it. It was just too strong for me. I would go again if I'm in town! Such a gorgeous restaurant!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"My friend Nick loves this place. I gotta say I'm a fan too. I always have a good meal and I've certainly ventured off the lunch menu too. A few recommendations.

First, get there early as the wait can get intense. If you absolutely have to be the one showing up at 7 on a Friday be prepared to wait or use Yelp Waitlist an hour (or two) before.

Second, drink the Thai iced coffee if you dare. I say if you dare as it's basically rocket fuel and is not for faint of heart. If you're tired drink one of these and you'll be juuuust right.

Last, being friends! This place does a great job with large parties and even if you go in a large group you're certain to be in and out quick. TV wastes no time in service and sometimes food is on the table shockingly quick.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Been wanting to try this place for awhile now and finally got to do so last night! Came around 6pm for dinner and the wait was already 45 minutes to an hour long for a table. Luckily there was no wait for bar seating. My boyfriend and I decided to sit at the bar but we made a mental note to use Yelp waitlist the next time we come back. As soon as we were seated we were greeted by the staff behind the bar and were given menus. The interior decor is absolutely stunning! The decoration is intricate and there's just so much gold colors everywhere! I would say that it is a pretty dim atmosphere which contributes to the overall vibe of the restaurant but it made it a little difficult to see.

My boyfriend and I started off with the Pla Muk Tod ($12) which was super crispy and paired nicely with the peanut vinaigrette dipping sauce. This was hands down one of the best fried calamari combos I have ever tried. Highly recommend if you're looking for an appetizer to share. We also tried the Mango Sunrise ($9) which was delicious! The drink is a combination of mango puree, pineapple juice, and coconut cream and I liked how creamy the consistency was. We did have to wait a bit for our main dishes to come out but nonetheless it was delicious as well. I got the Pad Se-Ew with chicken ($15) and it didn't disappoint. I am a huge fan of broad noodles and this dish is packed with so much flavor.

Service was good and the staff behind the counter was attentive throughout our meal. I would definitely come back again!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Swung by Thai Villa for an impromptu dinner on a Tuesday night. Expect a wait as this spot is super popular -- you can add yourself to a waitlist right out of Yelp!

First off, ambience: 5/5. Much of the staff is Thai, providing you with an authentic experience. The interior is stunning, with an open main dining area with high ceilings, surrounded by cozy elevated dining rooms.

For food, we started with the soft shell crab salad. The dish was nothing special. Soft shell crab itself already packs some serious flavor, yet they added this sauce that - in my opinion - was too salty. Would have been better with less sauce. For mains, we got the chicken red curry and pad kee mao. I love thai food and both of these were 5/5. Both have a respectable level of spice and the pad kee mao has thicker than usual flavor with deep flavor.

Now the reason for the 3*... we found a hair in our red curry dish and the waiter took it back. They prepared another serving, and after digging in a bit we found two more hairs! I didn't make a big deal of it (the food was delicious), but was a bit shocked that this happened twice. I was digging through the dishes, and seriously examining the hairs (and myself) to confirm I was not crazy.

I'll def be back - will update this rating if all goes well and the food is again tasty.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

At the restaurant, we were told there would be a 30-45 minute wait time, but it ended up only being 20 minutes. I loved my Panang curry. The Thai Medley Compote was delicious as well other than the clear oval things that reminded me of hard mochi. Would love to come back to try their lunch special which looks like a great deal. The decor is very pretty and the staff pleasant. Good for a date or small groups.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Only cons is waiting time.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"First off, this restaurant's interior is STUNNING, as can tell by the numerous photos of the interior.

Secondly, the most important part, the food: After I ordered, the waiter offered us a complementary drink, in a tiny shot glass. It was a butternut squash with coconut milk warm drink that tasted a mix like tom yum soup (a bit sour) and curry (because of the coconut milk). Although it wasn't that tasty, it was definitely nice to get that to start off (every customer gets this drink).

I got the chicken pangnang curry which was good! It was sweet and spicy (if you cannot tolerate spice, DO NOT get this dish). The chicken was soft and tender, contrary to typical Thai restaurants.

My friend ordered the basil thai fried rice, which was really good, but a bit spicier than my curry, so if you can't handle spice, you gotta let the waiter know what spice level you want!

Third, my waiter was super considerate and attentive! My friend had a seafood allergy, so he patiently went over the menu with his recommendations of the non-seafood dishes. He also went over the signature Thai Villa dishes since we both came here for the first time. Not only that, we conversed a bit with him, and he was very knowledgeable in the Thai cuisine, explaining about the importance of fish oil in the recipe of a traditional and delicious Pad Thai. He was also very attentive when my friend and I drank a lot of our water, consistently refilling our water when we are halfway done, and asked us twice how we enjoyed our food.

I will definitely come back again and try something new, maybe the Royal Pad Thai, if I feel like splurging. Definitely a bit pricy for the food, but worth it! Also, if you come at prime dinner time, like 5:30-7, be sure to reserve your spot on the Yelp waitlist to avoid a long wait time to be seated!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Thai Villa,"First of all, this restaurant is located in Manhattan. And the owner of this restaurant really spent a lot of money for the interior for trying to impress customers. I know that. But what we came here for is the fine dining. Yelp reviews failed about this restaurant completely in our (3 of us) opinions. Very dissappointed. Bad restaurant.

The quality of the foods were OK and nothing to write about them. The prices and portions for each dishes were just so outrageously expensive to be justified.

Another major turn off is the restaurant owner's nasty biased hateful partial political propaganda posted on the flyer on the wall. We came here for the foods. We did not come here for being bothered by your personal hate speech or hateful nasty political propaganda. Just leave that outside of the restaurant!

Thai Villa,"Thai Villa provides a beautiful dining setting with fantastic presentation of dishes. However, sadly it is lacking flavor, the and the price tag is high. On top of that, the wait is crazy long.

The best dish of the night was the amuse, a simple butternut squash soup that was tangy and flavorful. We spent about $100 after tip for one appetizer, two teas (non-alcoholic) and two main dishes. The chicken wrapped in pandas leaves was good. The main courses were incredibly disappointing in flavor although the presentation was impressive. The Royal Pad Thai was not balanced. It was heavy on the tamarind and sugar. The large prawn was nicely cooked though. The seafood in a coconut dish ($28) was just weird. It tasted like a salmon meat loaf. It reminded me of something I might make out of desperation if I ran out of food in the house and only had a can of salmon and a can of coconut milk. It said it was spicy on the menu, but spice was barely detectable. My husband absolutely hated this dish.

Service was friendly, but it took quite some time for the main dishes to come out.  My lychee Thai tea was delicious and a variation I usually don't see. If I returned, it would be only for appetizers and drinks at the bar. The entrees are not worth it. If you care about flavor, move on and choose another place. If you are more into atmosphere and don't mind paying more for food that looks pretty but doesn't taste special, then Thai Villa might be okay for you.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"How did I overlook writing a review for this fantastic restaurant? So when I visited New York for five days in 2017, I made it a goal to visit as many foodie places as I could to reap the most of its benefits. I looked up some of their favorite Thai restaurants in the area and although it was a bit further out than other places, I figured this place would be worth it thanks to the interior design, the classy look, the fantastic presentation of the food and the drinks.

While we waited for our third friend to meet us, my friend and I indulged in some pretty cocktails. Although I can't find the name of the cocktail on the online menu, it contained passionfruit flavors so I am always happy with that. It was a bit sweet, but definitely a delight to drink with our food.

When we were ready to be seated, we were taken to the upstairs area where we had a cozy corner to ourselves with a beautiful view of the downstairs and the golden chandelier up front and center before us. We were excited.

COMPLIMENTARY PINEAPPLE WITH BEEF (5/5): Obviously unexpected and surprisingly delicious. Hadn't tried that combination before...only pineapple with pork in al pastor tacos. ;)

PAPAYA SALAD (5/5): The presentation was beautiful and the taste was even better. Very classily done with the right amount of fish sauce, lime juice and juicy pieces of shrimp.

PAD THAI WITH CHICKEN (5/5): Another nicely presentable dish with crushed peanuts on the side, a lime wedge, scallions and all the works. Delicious.

CRAB FRIED RICE (5/5): An interesting fried rice combination I hadn't tried before. I'm definitely glad my friend suggested getting it. It's when I began appreciating actual crab again.

GREEN CURRY & JASMINE RICE (5/5): I ordered this with beef and eggplant pieces, with jasmine rice on the side. The curry was creamy, incredibly flavorful, perfectly complemented by the tender ones of beef and even more tender pieces of grilled eggplants, all while being perfectly met with a fluffy side of jasmine rice. The level of spiciness was mild, per my request, and I was happy with it.

All in all, Thai Villa takes on a more gourmet approach to Thai food. As much as I appreciate hole-in-the-wall places, it was nice to take a break and take in the true ambiance of comfortable, fine dining without breaking the bank.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Good food but there's a long wait and it's first-come, first-serve.A lot of culture in the decors and settings. Flavor seems to be spot on. For that, its pricey but you pay for the ambiance and location. Services were attentive and food came out quickly.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Beautiful interior, and the food is so delicious! We came for lunch and ordered 3 lunch specials: Kua Gai noodles, Massamun Curry, and Krapraw Gai. It came with 3 appetizers: Crispy Spring Rolls, Fried Chive Pancake, and Steamed Dumpling (all in 2s). All dishes were great!

The Kua Gai was perfect. At first, I was worried that it would be a basic dish, because the menu item description seemed basic. However, I ordered it because I already know what Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, and Pad Kea Mao taste like, and I wanted something different. I am glad I got the Kua Gai, and I would definitely get this again. It was simple, but delicious.

The Massamun Curry was great too. The chicken in the curry was not dry, unlike how meat in most Thai restaurants are.

The Krapraw Gai was spicy and was saltier than the other two dishes. It was really good, but having more rice to counter balance with the strong flavors of the dish would have been better. In the end, we finished all the rice and still left some of the minced chicken, because it was that strong.

Service is also great and waitresses are friendly. I definitely want to come back to Thai Villa another time for either lunch, dinner, or both!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Overall: Classy, Authentic, Spicy

Ambience: When I walked in, the first thing I noticed was how the long line. I was in a 145+ min wait on a Tuesday night. However, I used the Yelp call ahead feature to save a spot in line. As the waitress sat us down, I noticed how big this restaurant was from the inside, the high ceilings, the ornate decoration in the booth seats, the traditional dress code of the wait staff, all made me feel like I was in Phuket.

Menu: Our waitress asked us if we have been here before and took her time to explain use the menu. She also made recommendations from the traditional Thai dishes, including some spicy options. We ordered the drunken noodles and the pad kraw and both were extraordinarily good.

Drinks: We just had their beer. It was alright.

Service: I felt the service was great for how busy they were. Additionally, the waitress had us try a dish courtesy of the chef.

Price: Not too expensive for the quality and the experience. I highly recommend it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"+1 extra star because they use Waitlist (yay), and I was unexpectedly running late (unbeknownst to them, rushing like a madwoman and even hopping in a taxi for the last few blocks) and they were super cool about it. Most restaurants would have made a point to tell me I was late and act all bent out of shape but they were very gracious seating me. That experience was in line with service for the night, which was perfect.

Our waitress explained that there are essentially two menus: classic Thai options and a more unique section of ""privileged"" dishes you likely haven't seen before. Upon my husband sharing that I'm vegetarian, I really appreciate how our waitress took the time to point out which options can be made vegetarian as well as which use fish sauce. That level of understanding gives me confidence in what I'm eating. Unfortunately the exotic portion of the menu had no veg options, so I chose Praram (peanut sauce) and mock duck! Fake meat, hooray! It was really tasty and my husband thought it tasted very real (I have no frame of reference given I've been vegetarian for 25 years and I'm not sure I've ever actually had duck). The sauce was thick, sticky, and well balanced and mock duck was plentiful. At first I thought the vegetables were bland, but when stirred up with the peanut sauce covered mock dock, they were perfect and mitigated what otherwise would have been a too-peanuty experience. It came with white rice, which wasn't really necessary for me. We were also given a complimentary amuse bouche of sweet potato (?) chips with a dollop of spicy mayo.

The interior is beautiful largely due to the illuminated golden leaves hanging overhead, and that and the stellar ratings were why I chose Thai Villa, which did not disappoint.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"The food here is a little pricey, but it's worth it! We ordered the papaya salad, red curry, green curry, and pra ram. The papaya salad was fresh, bright, and delicious. I would definitely recommend getting this to start. The green curry was insanely spicy, so if that's not your thing, don't go for it. But the red curry had a pretty good spice level. Both were sweet and creamy. The pra ram was absolutely fantastic. I have never had it before, and after eating here, I crave it all the time.

The restaurant is absolutely beautiful inside. Their layout makes it good for both date nights and small groups!

They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait during peak times. For a party of 3 on a Friday at 5:30 pm, we waited about 45 minutes.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Thai Villa,"I've ordered from Thai Villa multiple time because I love the food, first time eating here however and was no disappointed.

The restaurant is very well decorated (see photos). Really inviting unique atmosphere.

The food as expected was great. Drinks menu was Thai inspired. Very flavorful. I particular went with the old fashioned.

The price was a little steep. This Thai food is very good. Tasted delicious. Nothing wrong with it, but there are other more authentic cheaper options out there.

Great as a date spot for the ambience. Prices is more of a $$$, but overall recommended.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"This place gets A LOT of traffic as can be seen from their excessive wait times. My friend brought me here as a birthday surprise and she used the Yelp ""add yourself to the waitlist"" online feature so we were seated a few minutes after we arrived since it was our turn. Otherwise you can expect to wait over an hour at peak times (dinner).

The place is very classy and well decorated so I can see why there's so much hype around it. The staff also runs like a well oiled machine, which is definitely necessary for a place like this. However, I have to say that efficiency also removes away from the personal experience of dining here. I felt somewhat rushed and like I was part of a conveyor belt of customers coming in and going out.

The food was delicious and came out incredible fast so there aren't any complaints there. I just wish I kinda had a chance to slow down and not feel like my table was needed ASAP.

I might return again because the food was good, but maybe at an off peak time.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Thai Villa,"They don't take reservations which truly sucks and you may need to hold up an exceptionally lengthy timespan to be situated however's everything greatly justified, despite all the trouble. we're so happy you love such a large number of our dishes.

Thai Villa,"Came here with my friend for lunch! Located in the Flatiron District, my favorite Manhattan neighborhood, this is a Thai restaurant that caught everyone's attention with it's stunning decor when it first opened a couple of years ago. Despite this, the vibe is surprisingly chill. We observed many diners who seem like they were on their lunch breaks from work and others who were just having a casual get-together with friends. We arrived shortly after they open at 12pm and the restaurant was already ~90% full! It's still very popular after all these years and I would definitely recommend making a reservation or getting here early if you don't want to wait to be seated.

We both ordered from the lunch special menu, which comes with a soup/salad, an appetizer, and an entree. I found the soup to be kind of boring. It's just a clear broth with enoki mushrooms and vegetables. Nothing exciting. For the appetizers, we shared the crispy spring rolls and the steamed dumplings and we both agreed that the spring rolls were the clear winners. For my entree I got my usual, the chicken pad kee mao, and I really enjoyed it. I just had horrible pad kee mao at another Thai restaurant a couple of weeks ago so it was such a relief to finally be able to taste one that's properly prepared. I also got to try some of my friend's pad see ew and that was absolutely delicious! Will definitely order that the next time I come back. We also got the Thai iced tea, which tasted standard.

Overall, I think this is a fantastic Thai restaurant. It's very trendy and an awesome place to take your friends if you want to impress them. I wouldn't say it's the best place for a date though- it's decently loud and the tables are kind of close to each other. The lunch specials are so worth it though. They're fairly priced and the portions of the entrees are actually pretty big. At other restaurants, the lunch special entrees are usually much smaller than their dinner counterparts to make up for the cheaper prices but here it seems like there really isn't much difference between the lunch special and dinner portions of the entrees. We both left comfortably full without feeling gypped. Service was very polite and attentive, even during the busy lunch rush. I think I'll be back!

Tips:
1- The best table for photos ops is at one of the side tables on your right when you first enter the restaurant. Make sure to sit facing away from the lights so that they show up in the background of your photo!
2- For group hangouts, I would recommend the booth seating on the left. It's more spacious and compartmentalized so that you can hold conversations without worrying about your neighbors eavesdropping.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I really enjoyed my visit at Thai Villa for lunch! They have a great lunch special that runs about $13-17 (depending on what you get) and includes soup/salad, an appetizer (with several choices, such as spring rolls, shrimp dumplings, and chive pancakes, and a frankly ENORMOUS entree (which, again, comes with several choices, including several fried rice, curry, and noodle dishes). It's really a steal, for the quality of the meal you get.

I visited today with two other friends and we all got lunch specials, as well as pots of tea (which are only $5 and definitely worth the price for tea fans). I got the salad, the chive pancakes, the beef pad thai, a pot of bluefly tea (with lemongrass), and a shared dessert of coconut ice cream with sticky rice. It was all delicious, with the coconut ice cream in particular being a sweet, delicate treat, the bluefly tea being a mild, lemony delight, the chive pancakes being an awesomely gelatinous mass, and the pad thai being so massive I couldn't even finish my meal. My friends liked their meals as well, especially the lychee ice tea!

The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, has comfortable seating, and has generally nice, efficient wait-staff. The only problems you might run into is that the staff sometimes tries to rush you out if the place is especially busy... and this place generally gets *really* busy. Unless you're good with waiting for over an hour, I would strongly suggest you make a reservation and make it in on time... they will *not* hold your table for long! Other than that, though, I recommend this place!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Thai Villa,"The most captivating thing about this restaurant is the decor. They really captured a Thai experience that feels lavish. They really nailed the ambience. I made a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday. However, I was disappointed. With a reservation on a Monday we still had to wait 30-40 minutes. However the food was tasty and the plate setting was very creative as well as the cocktails. The waitress was very friendly, helpful and prompt.

Updated review:
Honestly the customer service at Thai Villa is really extraordinary. I was truthful about my first visit at this restaurant and they reached out to me and apologized. I went tonight and this experience was amazing from start to finish. We were seated immediately once our party was complete. The service was impeccable they really paid attention to every detail. They ensured every drink and entree came out quickly and they really made this experience wonderful. I really thought this second time was a charm and I am happy to say that I really look forward to coming back. I recommend the mussels appetizer it actually one of my favorite mussel dishes I've ever had. The duck and the shrimp entrees were both sweet and savory. I really commend this restaurant on their service it was truly a perfect night and I couldn't have hoped for anything better!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Beautiful is an understatement for this restaurant. I went to celebrate a birthday dinner with family and friends on a Thursday night. There were 5 of us in total. They told us it was a 45 min wait but we were called in about 25min. The service was quick, friendly, efficient and the restaurant was nice and clean.

The drinks were amazing as well as the food. We shared calamari and I ordered duck as a main dish. Honestly the and best I've ever had, it wasn't overcooked and was still hot when it reached the table.

I would definitely visit again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"My sister had hyped up this place for 4 months leading up to my New York visit. That, plus being told it was a 1 hr and 45 minute wait on a Tuesday,  made my expectations super high. And this place met and surpassed all of them!

To avoid the nearly 2 hr wait, my sister and I sat at the bar (only a 10 minute wait). The bartender was super attentive and friendly, giving us great recommendations based on how adventurous we were feeling and how spicy we like things. The menu is divided into more classic dishes (pad thai, papaya salad), but with a royal twist, and more specialty items. We opted for braised beef curry (Kaeng Neur Lamyai Bai Chapoo), and a crispy catfish salad.

The catfish salad is super crispy (not fish fillet), with a dressing with a perfect balance of acidity, heat, and sweetness. I've had this dish in Thailand once and haven't found a place that serves it until now. I loved it! The beef curry is topped with taro chips, naturally sweeten by logan (kind of like lychee), and has a generous amount of deliciously tender beef. It was a very rich and thick curry sauce.

The service, the decor, and the food made for the best dining experience I had during my New York trip. I will definitely be back next time!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"The mid-stride stopping interior design & decor, the excellent service, and most importantly, the food. I cannot recommend this place enough. It is relatively inexpensive for the Flat Iron neighborhood too! I will definitely be coming back here for the amazing Thai cuisine.

I had the seabass and fried dumplings, my co-worker had the vegetarian option, the portions are HUGE. We ate everything! And the staff started us off with a shot glass each full of hot squash-coconut soup on the house which was so rich and creamy and I can still taste it as I write this review. Ugh SO GOOD.

This is my new favorite go-to Thai spot in this area of the city, and it should be yours too!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Somehow, when my sister and I visited on a weekend evening, we were able to be seated immediately. We got pretty lucky, because the place was packed.

The menu is gigantic - it's overwhelming, almost in a choice-anxiety inducing way. It rewards eating with a large party - you get the impression  that there's some really good dishes, but if you're unfamiliar with the menu you could easily pay for lackluster ones - and the dishes aren't cheap.

We split the Royal pad thai, hor mok talay (seafood in coconut milk & coconut shell), and sa koo sai moo (stuffed tapioca dumplings). The presentation of the dishes were fantastic, especially the Royal pad thai and it's delicate egg lattice. The presentation, including the shimmery ambiance of the restaurant, seems to be a huge part of the draw.

+ Royal pad thai - Just okay. It didn't have more flavor beyond one of many standard, good pad thai's I've had. Noodles were slightly overcooked

+ Hor mok talay - My favorite. The brininess of the seafood made an interesting contrast to the creamy coconut milk broth. But the portion was small for ~$26

+ Sa koo sai moo - these initially were decent, but as they cooled down the chewiness of the tapioca exterior made it tastier

Overall - good, but not great for the price. It's too bad, because I'd love to get a better flavor of their remaining menu via what seems like handy takeout options. The presentation and interior of the restaurant are gorgeous, but at least the few samplings we had of the menu weren't enough for me to come back.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Delicious, but slightly overpriced. My husband, infant and I met up with two friends here for dinner the other night. We signed up for the online Yelp wait list, and it took about 90 minutes to get a table. The restaurant itself is very cute, charming and has a hip, Thai vibe. The menu is pretty large and we ordered family style. We got the steamed dumplings, pad thai, a duck dish and then another dish that I cant remember. They served us free, small samples of a squash, lemongrass soup that absolutely blew my mind. We ended up ordering two bowls for the table. It was honestly so delicious that I would have eaten two bowls for myself and just called it a night. Our food came out within a decent time frame and everything was tasty. The presentation of the pad thai was beautiful, but the taste was a little bit lackluster. It was also hard to pay $25 for pad thai, when we paid $1 for some that was 25x more amazing in Thailand. However, it is Manhattan, so we overpay for everything. I shouldn't really be surprised any longer.

All in all, the meal was great, the vibe was hip and we enjoyed our dinner. I'd definitely return if I was in the mood for a trendy, Thai meal.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Thai Villa,"*Reviewing the order pick-up experience via their website*

To start, the food was delicious: the tom kha was rich and flavorful and the pad krapraw was equally as good.  What really stole the show for me was the lychee Thai tea.  They put a few whole lychees at the bottom (I'm guessing they're the canned ones) and it's the most refreshing drink I've ever had.  I like how there wasn't any milk in it (I'm weird in that I don't like to mix milk and tea), and nothing was lacking from the drink.  While the food at Thai Villa was very good, it's the lychee Thai tea that would make me come back in a heartbeat.

I placed an order for pick-up for lunch on a Saturday and everything went fairly smoothly.  I ordered directly on their website, and got a discount because it was my first order placed with them (it seems like they prefer it when you order through them and not GrubHub).  Even though the restaurant opens at noon for lunch, the earliest pick-up time was 12:30pm.  I must have taken too long to put in my order because by the time I put it in around 12:10, the earliest pick-up time had been pushed to 12:45.  I ended up getting to the restaurant earlier than that and it was ready, so the exact timing could have been better, but it's not a main detractor.

Overall, Thai Villa has great food and drinks (i.e. the lychee Thai tea... I didn't try anything else), but is on the pricier side.  With the 20% discount from ordering online, the total came out to just over $30 for the bowl of soup, entree, and iced tea.  If I'm back in the area, I'd revisit Thai Villa just to get the tea, and plan the rest of my meal around that.  That makes it a good restaurant in my books!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"The rice cracker dish was quite good. We also really enjoyed the Tom Yum soup. The duck salad was average. We also ordered one other thing that wasn't very memorable.

Service was pretty good considering how busy it was.

Overall pretty tasty -- I think the flavors were bold without being heavy-handed. Definitely a step able Thai food in recent memory.

Minus one star for requiring a Facebook check-in for Wi-Fi. Something about this just doesn't sit right with me.

When I'm in the mood for Thai and remember to save a spot in line before end of work, I'll come back to try the curry and pad see ew.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I went there last Monday with my friends and it was pretty busy even it's raining. The hostess is nice & she asked me if I would like to check my coat or not (without asking for). That was the first impression when I feel that she's willing to help.

After we got seated, our server, May, came to introduce herself. We asked her to recommend any drinks in the menu. She has a good knowledge about the signature cocktails. I & my friends were really enjoy the cocktails.

For the food, we ordered a lot of food which I can't explain dish by dish. Overall, the food tastes great! The presentation & the way they serve is cute! I really love the way they serve the appetizers by a size of a small bite (you can see in the pic).

For the service, not only my server is nice. All the staffs over there are nice too. Even they're busy working, they're still keep smiling to their customers.

I would definitely for back again for sure!

PS. You gotta make a reservation to avoid the long wait",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"If you love Thai, this place is legit. If you're unsure you even like Thai, this place will make love.

You can put your name on the waitlist from yelp, which is nice. But first timers beware. If the app gives you a time to check in, that doesn't mean your reservation time. Example, my name was on the waitlist, said to check I'm by 7pm. Once I got there, thank goodness I checked in with the host. She informed me that all members of my party must be present, and that I had another 40 min wait. This is the only reason I didn't give this review 5 stars. Wait was quite long. Total wait time was about 1.5 hrs.

Thankfully there's a bar there, but you must check with the host! And you can order drinks if there's standing room only, but only through the host. Which actually makes sense as it makes it less stressful for the patron, and more manageable by the establishment.

Everything was delicious and well worth the wait. The dining room is so well done. Great ambiance! Appetizers were delish, drinks were tasty (try the lychee drink with a vodka soaked lychee!), and entrees were so good you don't want to leave any behind!

Probably the best move since I didnt have a reservation. I kept hearing that the wait was over 1 hr, approaching 2hrs if you didnt plan ahead.

I only waited about 15min for my food and I was not disappointed. I got chicken pad see ew, spicy. If you're not one that gets spicy food regularly, I would recommend getting medium spicy. I thought it was a good level of spicy where you could still taste your food. Other than that, it was a great pad see ew dish. Very comparable to the pad see ew I ate in a local restaurant in Phuket, Thailand.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"We just finished at CAMP NYC and were looking for a local kid friendly place. We weren't sure how kid friendly Thai Villa was but the overwhelming reviews had us sold.

We were not disappointed! The Pad Thai and Red Curry was FABULOUS. Pineapple fried rice, great! Everything we ordered was perfect, we could easily see why everyone raves about Thai Villa. It makes me wish I lived nearby so we could have it more often. As for the kid friendly part, we had a booth upstairs so they were sort of contained.

Thai Villa,"I came here with a friend for lunch a normal weekday. It was pretty packed, but we were still able to get seats without a wait. I'm sure this is definitely not the case for dinnertime.  

For one thing, the interior is definitely a sight, creating a nice ambience. It'd be perfect for a date night or a gathering with friends.

I ordered from the lunch special, which I'd definitely recommend! It's worth it, for sure. You get a soup/salad, a choice of appetizer, and an entree dish. I was expecting the dish to be on the smaller side, but I was surprised to see how large it was. It made me wonder what the dinner portion would be. I chose the salad, chicken/pork dumplings, and chicken pad kee mao ($14 total). They were all delicious and I was stuffed by the end!!

As for the regular menu, it's quite large and diverse. The menu is broken down into classics, rare/secret, and chef signatures. The pricing, however, is definitely on the high end. My friend ordered a dish from the chef's signatures - Hor Mok Talay. She was just as happy with her order.

Ive had the Kee Mao, also known as drunken noodles. It is super flavorful without being overly salted. I like that you can choose a level of spiciness. I went with 'spicy' and next time I will try 'very spicy.' I heard their very spicy is indeed pretty flaming. Im looking forward to it.

I can't wait to come back to try more items on their menu. They have a pretty comprehensive lunch menu.

2 Stars! I love Thai food, been to Thailand and decided to go here on Valentine's Day. Not sure what the chefs were doing in the kitchen this day. The food was such a complete disappointment. The only two dishes that were subpar was the papaya salad and the curry puffs.

The Pad Krapraw was the most bland and flavorless dish that I've ever had at any Thai restaurant in my life. Very bad. This dish is supposed to be flavorful and spicy and honestly it was neither of the two. Never experienced a more bland dish at any Thai establishment. Guess they never heard of salt or pepper??

The Royal Pad Thai, was definitely not royal in any sense of the word. It was just ok!

Rather large space they have that includes both an upstairs and bar space and yet the wait was still an hour and fifteen minutes. We ended up going around the corner bar for a drink until we got a text to come back.

We were seated promptly and ordered the whole fried fish along with a few other dishes and some beers. Overall a great experience and amazing decor. We'll be back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I've been to NYC twice and this is the best meal I've ever had here. Everything about the restaurant was great. The set up, ambience, food, cocktail, and staff made this an amazing experience. The shrimp tasted incredibly fresh and my dish was seasoned perfectly. I recommend making a reservation because they do get busy. We made ours and walked past a large crowd and were immediately seated. This is currently my only five star review.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"The wait here is crazy long, but for good reason. They do not accept reservations from Friday-Sunday, so don't except to come here for a weeknight dinner without waiting 1.5 hours.

The ambiance is romantic and sophisticated, but always noisy and overly crowded. But the food.. the food is amazing.

Come here for more sophisticated shrimp pad thai and a crunchy soft shell crab over mango salad.
The flavors are all so wonderful.

I don't recommend the duck or the drinks though. The drinks were soo so soooo sweet!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I ordered massum curry with chicken. According to the menu, it's 15 bucks. They charged me 17 bucks. When I pointed out, they said the menu is not updated. If the price has changed, please let people know before they order.

It's not a matter of 2 bucks but the dishonesty hurts the reputation.

Be careful when you order. Maybe you want to clarify the price to be sure.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"We finally make it to Thai Villa by joining the Yelp Waitlist when it opens at 5 pm! We were seated by 5:30 pm at a very cozy little patio overlooking the first floor.

Food is AMAZING as so many reviews I have read.

Ray Rai Nah Phu - 4/5
Curry paste with shrimp and crab meat wrapped with belet leaves. Very interesting combination with so many layers of flavor. I loved it when so had my first one. But it was a little too much for me when I had my second one. But overall pretty. I'll order again with a large party.

Royal Pad Thai - 4/5
Very beautiful display and taste good. I only gave 4 out of 5 because I was also expecting some different or unique flavor of the dish than a normal pad Thai. But Pad Thai is always a Pad Thai haha. It's for sure a safe bet that will never go wrong.

Kaeng Neur Lamyai Bai Chapoo - 5/5
My boyfriend had the braised beef and he loved it. The betel leaves adds some unique flavor that we don't normally get from other restaurants. Get that if you would like to try something new and love spicy food.

Overall a very pleasant experience here. I'll definitely come back again and explore more dishes.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Thanks to Keith for being such a great server!! He gave us wonderful dish recommendations and made sure everything was okay.

The food here is definitely worth the price as this restaurant matches the authenticity of its cuisine. Would recommend getting the Royal Pad Thai as I've never had a dish like it before. Even though I was told to wait 2+ hours for a table, the hostess seated us (at the bar) within 20 minutes of arriving. You can also get some aesthetic photos as the interior is stunning!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Awesome Thai place, would def recommend them to anyone craving or who loves Thai food.
Amazing service! I drink a lot of water and never saw the glass empty, food comes out quickly as well. Only thing you'll be waiting on is actually getting in, you can check In and reserve your spot o line through yelp which is super helpful.

Price point I not that bad either, portion sizes are fare. We started with the papaya salad and tapioca balls. The papaya salad was delicious, I don't really like fish oil so don't normally like papaya salad but they don't use much of it here and is not overwhelming at all! The tapioca balls were ok.

My fiancé got the wood fired Branzino which was fried very well and tasty. I got the royal pad Thai, which I've never paid more than $14-15 for P.F. Thai but this dish tasted just as good as it looked!

Check them out!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I love Thai food! Especially great and authentic Thai food which you don't see many in US, and Thai villa is one of them. Their renovation is very luxury and Thai style, the location is great, 5 mins walk from union square. You can join the waitlist on yelp before you come, so that you can avoid a long waiting time and standing in front of the restaurant.

Tips, We ordered their Pun sip salmon, kao tang  Na tung, chicken satay, royal pad Thai, and taro chips. If you don't know any of these names, just trust me, they are incredibly delirious!!!!!!!! It should be Good enough for 2 people if you are not crazy hungry.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Food...was ok it wasn't that great. The coconut drink was amazing but that was it. A lot of the food options shared the same taste. They didn't have the basic coconut pudding with the corn or taro sometimes. Was a bit disappointed cause the hype wasn't worth it.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"There is no doubt in my mind when I gave a full 5  rating to this restaurant. From the ambiance to the service (our server was a delightful girl NASHA) and of course the FOOD - everything was amazing. This is one of the MUST EAT AT in NEW YORK CITY

This place epitomizes the gracious warmth hospitality and the flavors of Thailand.

I hence forth revise my previous rating from December 2018

Thai Villa,"Thai Villa was a Thai dining experience above par! The ambiance and decor of the restaurant is really mystical and really beautiful and the food definitely matches that. I went for lunch and was seated promptly since we went early.

The food that we ordered was delicious. My noodles had a ton of chicken and vegetables in it, and it was flavored super fragrantly and nicely. The texture of the noodles and the whole thing together was really tasty and really filling. The portions were good and the experience was fantastic.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"My friend and I came to Thai Villa at 6pm on a Thursday.  We made a reservation by calling ahead and I highly recommend you do so because the restaurant is busy!  The decor here is absolutely breathtaking and the ambiance is more suited for a date or professional dinner.  We lucked out and got one of two tables that were upstairs which made for a quieter dining experience.

I ordered the panang curry with chicken (I forgot to look at the receipt for the price.  It's listed as $14 under lunch specials and I'm not sure if it was more expensive for dinner.)  My friend ordered the goong ma kham (shrimp tamarind)($30).  Compared to other panang curries I've had, this one was much spicier and had less peanut flavor.  For some Thai places, I feel that even when they indicate a dish is spicy, it's not that bad, but this place does have a kick so if you are sensitive, pass on the curry.  The curry was a good size and had a decent amount of meat and veggies.  My friend said that the shrimp had amazing flavor but the sauce made the dish salty.  If you are sensitive to salt, you may want to make sure the shrimp isn't soaking!  Overall, I found the food to be tasty but slightly overpriced and nothing that made it the best Thai food I'd ever had.

Service here was also on point.  Even if we were upstairs, we never felt like the staff forgot about us.  There were multiple check-backs and waters were always filled.  They also gave us a complimentary shot of soup on the house, which tasted like warm bamboo.  Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and would return to try more dishes!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Thai Villa,"Walking into this establishment is a vibe. The ambiance of the place is very breathtaking. Get here early! The place is always packed. We had a 45 minute wait.
The Thai food is innovative. The issues with traditional food it kind of all tastes the same but Thai Villa added something different",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Both the food and drinks at Thai Vila are great - in a pre covid world, dining in without a reso usually consisted of a long (worthwhile) wait, but the food is fresh, and authentic. I will say however, that ordering delivery from here isn't the greatest. I found that the noodles and shrimp in my dish were both extremely overcooked and then cold by the rime I got it. But looking forward to being able to dine in again hopefully soon!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"So there's a huge wait at peak hours - definitely use the Yelp app to reserve a spot in line.

The food is good. Nothing to rave about, but not overly salty, prices are in line with the norm, and good portions.

My problem was with how packed the restaurant was. I don't mean that it was popular - which it is. I mean that they have the tables so close together that you are practically eating in a military mess hall. You have to be really loud to hear each other over other people's conversations, and it's a mess trying to get into your seat or out of your seat.

4 stars for food.
2 stars for ambience.
3 star average.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Do you really need to rate this place? It is an exquisite experience to have, not once or twice, but as much as you can afford it!

I took my cousin and he coworkers who are visiting the city for the first time to try the best Thai in New York. A friend of mine had told me about it and didn't know what to expect when she said ""a royal Thai experience""

The wait, as it's already clear for you, is VERY long. However, if you enter the waitlist, the wait time is 15-20mins+ accurate.

I loved their welcome bites, gluten free will also love their potato bites with mango sauce!

We got: Red Curry (my fav), Pad Thai, Coconut Shell Sea Food (I invented the name lol), and another beef option that I didn't try.

In terms of presentation, this is a place you'd probably want to take your parents in law to, enough to impress them without being too much. Just make sure you're seated fast by joining the waitlist in yelp.

In terms of prices, the menu have tens of options, you can go classic and affordable dishes to more fancy fusion ones.

Will be coming again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,LOVE THIS PLACE!! This restaurant is probably the most beautiful restaurant in NYC. Amazing interior and good service too. I always get the red curry and they give it a good spice level too. By far one of my favorite places in the city. I always look forward to going there. I always get myself a Singha beer too,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"We ventured here from jersey city and it did not disappoint! If you sign up on the waitlist and your table is ready, you only have ten minutes to get there before they skip you. We were 11 minutes late and was told the wait would be about 30 minutes! It was a Friday night, so the wait was long everywhere. We decided to wait and actually got seated within 10 minutes - without putting your name on the waitlist I heard the hostess tell walk ins that it would be 2-3 hour wait. The decor is beautiful and didn't feel cramped despite how crowded it was. They also have limited seating on the second floor. The drinks were delicious, I ordered a lychee martini and I have to say it might be the best I've ever had. The menu is surprisingly large with so many options. I opted for the kee mow (drunken noodle) and it was everything I needed it to be. It definitely was spicy! I'm usually one to throw more chili flakes on top but the level of heat was perfect! Flavorful and chewy noodles. Service was great, waitstaff was knowledgeable about the menu. Would recommend!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"Everything about Thai Villa was top notch. Great food. Very attentive service and a killer ambience.

Thai Villa,"It's one of those places you walk past on the street and do a double take because it looks like a freaking palace on the inside. I took myself on a date here, sat at the bar, drank a great glass of red wine, ordered the ginger stir fry entree, then the dessert that has the coconut ice cream. It was suchhhh a vibe, i'll go back! Very chill, very chic, way more A+++ on the interior design than any Thai Place i've been to.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants
Thai Villa,"I am a big Masters of None fan so naturally all the places mentioned in the show are on my list to visit. While I was in NY, I had a short window of time to visit Thai Villa and I am so glad I did! It's a great place! Warm yet bright; casual yet romantic; cozy yet big. The ambience is wonderful, as soon as you enter you notice the gorgeous golden tree hanging from the ceiling. It's the center of the restaurant and very memorable. I absolutely loved the gold. Since we had a very short time here, we only ordered jasmine tea and pad thai noodles. The jasmine tea is so pretty when it blooms and delicate tasting when you drink it. The noodles were so elegantly presented - the noodles laid in almost like a cocoon, in a nest of leaves enveloping the tasteful noodles. Though I have had pad thai noodles countless times before, I have never experienced them like this. The whole experience, though short, felt almost luxurious while eating Thai food. I cannot wait to visit again and experience the whole restaurant once again and also check off more restaurants from Master of None.

Tip: make a reservation because it's always busy!
Tip 2: do check out the bathrooms because they are beautiful!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-villa-new-york-2?osq=restaurants

Huli Huli Hawaiian Rotisserie,"Huli Huli Hawaiian Rotisserie at the new Deco Food Hall in Midtown West could do better.

I stopped by recently for lunch. For $16.33 (including tax) I got:
- A small Hawaiian Spam Rice ($3.50), that had specks of egg, scallion, and onion, and that seemed to use specks of generic luncheon meat instead of spam for a disappointingly bland experience.
- A small Furikake French Fries ($3.50), with a nice salty garlic seaweed flavor that was the highlight of the meal. I would get this again.
- A Chicken Salad Sandwich ($8.00), a somewhat small portion of chicken salad on a sweet Hawaiian potato bread, with lettuce, sriracha mayonnaise, raw red onions, and a couple of inedible pieces of hard cartilage.

Huli Huli gets points for using compostable cardboard dinnerware, having friendly staff and a colorful paper tote bag, but my overall impression is that their food isn't worth the price.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/huli-huli-hawaiian-rotisserie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Well it looked good and had a an aroma. And I tasted the fries and the Furikake taste like fish, like cod fish to me. But I look it up and it suppose to taste like garlicky seaweed, and seaweed is not for me and maybe they added too much fish sauce, I don't know because this is my first time. Well after eating a few I put to the side. I also had the Hawaiian Sun Pineapple Orange soda and that was OK.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/huli-huli-hawaiian-rotisserie-new-york?osq=restaurants

I did read that another yelper thought it was bland too but I had to try it for myself. The spam pieces if there are any is very tiny along with the eggs and scallions.

He added fresh greens, pickled vegetables, lots of fresh vegetables, and steamed broccoli. The croutons are really good too. It was really delicious. I'm so glad I stopped by here.

Huli Huli Hawaiian Rotisserie,"I was really excited to try this, I work nearby and saw the chicken salad sandwich on the news. I normally don't leave reviews in general but i'm actually hoping someone will see this adjust accordingly--there's an overwhelming amount of cartilage and bone in the chicken salad. They were razor sharp and tiny. I spent the better portion of my meal picking bones out of my teeth, slightly petrified I would swallow one of the splintered ones and genuinely hurt myself. If it had happened once I would've made a generous assumption that this was just bad luck, it happens in food. But again the amount of bones and cartilage was actually alarming. I see in another review someone experienced the same thing with the chicken salad sandwich. It's a shame because the place is adorable, the staff was super kind, and the rest of the sandwich was fresh and delicious. Chicken salad needs a different preparation.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/huli-huli-hawaiian-rotisserie-new-york?osq=restaurants

Overall Scale: 5/5

I first found out about this spot from a feature on the Food Network a while ago and finally got the chance to stop on in. Man was my mind blown. It's a small restaurant and menu is precise but the food is filled with a large portion of flavor and love from the first bite to the last scrape of my bowl! My mom and I sat and enjoyed our meal while listening to the sweet sounds of Caribbean music.

My mom described the food as POPPIN' (lol) in other words outstanding and she is a woman that is hard to impress. She also expressed that it was the best salmon that she had ever had! Now that's how you make an impression!

Definitely a place to check out if you're ever in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/huli-huli-hawaiian-rotisserie-new-york?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Been waiting to go here for some time, but between my schedule and theirs, it took some time to work out. But when my big bro and I wanted to hang out, the universe brought us all together to The Food Sermon.  

While smaller than I expected, the food packs a wallop.  We're both vegetarians, so my my bro had the Tofu Veggie with chickpeas in the coconut ginger broth with brown rice, I had the Veggie (which also has sauteed kale, mushrooms, and broccoli) minus the tofu, also in coconut ginger broth and brown rice, but with read beans.

I have to say, we were both floored.  We were catching up on stuff, but half of every time I tried to talk my food kept calling back at me.  As we were sitting in the window seats (the place got packed really quickly) it did make my rudeness with chomping down my food mid-convo a bit easier, LOL.  The sorrel was also on point, which doesn't happen to often.  

The only complaint is that they didn't have any ice, which to me is an easy fix, but the drinks were cool upon serving.  

By time we left the place emptied out a bit and so we got to chat with the owner who is a very cool, personable guy. The staff is also on point, lending to my 5th star, which I do not easily dole out.  And the mark of a great meal for me is its heartiness...that you're satisfied for some time after. We ate close to 4pm but I wasn't really hungry again for the rest of the night.

Being born and raised in Brooklyn, Crown Heights and Lefferts Gardens were always two of my favorite neighborhoods, so I'm glad a spot like Food Sermon exists here.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Food Sermon was amazing! Yup, I had to start with that one-liner.

My Queen and I couldn't decide on a brunch spot, didn't wanna travel far, wanted to dine somewhere Black Owned, wanted Caribbean food.... etc. After more than a dozen searches we circled back to this spot on the yelp app. This place checked all the boxes on our list and happened to be a stone through from prospect park... double win.

We arrive at the restaurant and immediately notice the wooden table and benches, this gave off a very homey vibe and reminded me a lot of Trinidad. Upon entering the aroma welcomes you just as energetically as the staff does. We returned the greeting and ask for recommendations... of course, we inform the gentleman at the register (co-owner) that beef isn't an option so he suggested the chicken and fish. My Queen went with the crusted salmon over white rice, chickpeas, and the coconut (ginger I think) sauce. Mine was the jerk chicken over brown rice, red beans, and the tomato base. Both means were individually delicious, there was zero food envy at the table and the sorrels we bought were great additions.

Personally, the jerk bowl doesn't need anything... it was great by itself. The fish on the other hand, though delicious and balanced was slightly enhanced by the pepper sauce. Disclaimer!!! PEPPER SAUCE is NOT the same as HOT SAUCE, so don't use it the same way.

Also, be mindful of the wooden bench base as we had a shin incident that required some attention. This was quickly remedied by both the owners.

I have always struggled to pass by this place while it was actually open. Today was the day. Let me tell you about how the clouds open up, God reached down and said ""lemme get some""

I had the salmon with brown rice, red beans, and the coconut ginger dressing.

It was literally magical from the first bite to the last. And that was take out so I imagine there is an additional layer of joy and heaven if you are eating it freshly prepared.

I don't like how the space is set up for seating but other then that it's a win for me.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"This place is great! I'm a midwestern transplant, so all of the options seemed a little spicy to me, but in that so flavorful and amazing way. The oxtail was simply divine, and I can't wait to come back and build up my spice muscle.

Also, I love the graphics and overall vibe of the place.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Hits the spot! Fresh and delicious. I got the salmon bowl w chickpeas- yummy! I still fantasize about the hot sauce.

Small portions is my only complaint...because I'm greedy",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Honestly, I wanted to love this place because the reviews and of the option of the coconut ginger sauce. After much afterthought, I can't justify the price for what they give you. The staff is nice though, when inquired what mauby was, the cashier did warn me it was an acquired taste and gave us a sample to try. Indeed it was, I'll never try that again since there was star anise involved and it was bitter, neither of which I like. The sorrel here is different from what I've had in other places as it was almost syrupy sweet and strongly flavored, it's not something I'd order again. They do make and bottle their own hot sauce, which I was told wasn't spicy but flavorful. I dipped just the end of the tine of my fork to taste, and I immediately had to drink my water. Not spicy?! To each their own!
I chose the salmon ($16) with brown rice and chickpeas served with coconut ginger sauce. The salmon is a little more than one inch strip that was just a touch overcooked and slightly sweet. The coconut ginger sauce was tasty and done well, but I feel that they could have been more generous with it. Curry chickpeas were lightly flavored in a good way. I feel that the price point is wrong with the amount of food or vice versa, that is given for this neighborhood. So, unless you have money to burn or you're really hankering for some coconut ginger sauce, I can't really recommend this place for the financially (and hungry) conscious.

Tl;dr:
Overpriced for the amount of food they give
Small amount of salmon fillet given
Not enough tasty coconut ginger sauce
Curry chickpeas lightly flavored, in a good way",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"A friend of mine recommended that we stop by The Food Sermon while we're in town and I'm so glad he did!

The prices are great and the food is delicious. The concept is similar to Chipotle, but with Caribbean food. You pick a protein, rice, beans, and sauce and they make your food to order.

I did jerk chicken, red beans, white rice, and coconut ginger sauce. The bowl was delicious, especially with their house made hot sauce, which is more flavorful than spicy.

My husband ordered the lamb, which was super tender and flavorful.

They don't serve beer on premises, but we just ran to the bodega across the street and got some beers that we were allowed to drink at the restaurant.

The staff is super friendly and seem like really good guys. Highly recommend!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"I am from Jamaica and my mother is an EXCELLENT cook.  Her food is so good that I am a bit hesitant about other Caribbean food.  To say that I am picky about Caribbean food is an understatement.  I say that because this place sells the best restaurant Caribbean food that I have ever had, period.  The food is so delicious and clean tasting.  That is the thing too, its the clean taste of the food that has me posting on yelp, which I loathe.

Went in on a busy night and there was a line but ordering didn't take too long. Ended up trying the Jerk Chicken bowl with a side of broccoli. So GOOD!! Very fresh, great spice, great flavor and just plain DELICIOUS!

As I walked i n I was nicely greeted by a young woman at the register. I grabbed the menu which is very small and straight to the point. I let her know that I will have the Jerk Chicken dinner. The entire ambiance of this restaurant is very warming. I was also greeted by the cook and my food came shortly in a nice packaging.

No alcohol and fairly slow service but they are a small space and seem to do a lot of takeout and delivery. If you get stuck behind those orders it takes a while to get your food even if you are dining in.

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Most satisfying first bite of flavor I've had in a while.

I got the jerk chicken, chickpeas, and spicy tomato sauce (which was excellent) with a side of sautéed mushrooms. But if you wanna splurge with a few extra dollars, the humongous lamb shank is also a good buy. The meat fell off the bone so easily and was packed with seasoning.

The food presentation alone makes this place stand out. Did not feel at all like any of the fast casual restaurants that are built on the same concept of build-your-own-bowl. Evident that lots of care is put into making this food.

Would have liked a tiny bit more tomato sauce ('cause it was so good) to coat the large portions they give you, but I ended up using their hot sauce to do the job, which was also a fantastic added layer.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

- Staff is really friendly
- Restaurant has a nice chill vibe
- Fast / never crowded
- I'm indifferent about the food because the flavors weren't great but overall it was ok. Didn't wow me away

- EXPENSIVE (spent $20 on jerk chicken & bottle water) / ($4 for broccoli, plantain, other sides)
- Very very few menu options (fish, jerk chicken or oxtail)
- Not always open",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Food Sermon is special. I think I learn a bit more about the space and the vision each time I visit. I believe they started purely for catering purposes, but transitioned into a restaurant following the demand. I don't get to go often, and have only been twice as they've been closed on a few occasions I tried to stop in. The food is Caribbean inspired and from what I understand, the menu has seen quite a few changes since it's inception.

The current menu features rice bowls with choice of lamb shank, jerk chicken, or pan-seared tofu. My mouth is watering thinking about it! This comes with a choice of coconut ginger or spicy tomato sauce and Market vegetables. On both visits, I chose the spicy tomato with tofu. I'm a saucy girl, and would've loved if there was more sauce. But the food was still delicious; the flavours really pop. I pretty much inhaled my bowl and accordingly wished the serving size was a tad bigger. The jerk chicken and lamb are hefty portions, but the tofu only comes with three slices of tofu and leaves me wanting more.

The sorrel is very light but I also wouldn't expect my Trinidadian mother's Christmas sorrel here.

It's BYOB also, so also feel free to come with a beer. We went the wine route. The cashier is pleasant and it's a small but well utilised space with a communal table and high counter seating-open kitchen with lovely island vibe interior.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,I call the the West Indian version of chipotle! Delicious and includes healthy options . You basically make your own bowl and the portion size is enough to have leftovers. Ive heard great things about this place and it was dedicated worth the hype. I had brown rice with salmon which was seasoned to perfection with the coconut ginger sauce. This spot is also owned by a Vincentian so I had to come in and support my people. Would definitely return and would recommend!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"I'm definitely a fan of Food Sermon and have gone multiple times since they opened. I will say at the start that this is mainstream Caribbean food and if you are looking for down home version of you should hit a spot on Nostrand. Either way, the food at Food Sermon lives up to its namesake. It's always tasty and made fresh.

You can customize your island bowl by picking from one of four proteins, two kinds of rice, two kind of sauce, two kinds of beans and vegetable sides, if you want. I usually get the Pablo crusted salmon, with white rice, red beans and sautéed kale covered in their red spicy sauce. I love when food is served pipping hot and their food is always served hot. The salmon is cooked well, not dry and over done. The kale is bright green, not over dressed and has a great bite.

My other fav is the lamb shank which is enough food for two days. The Lamb is always tender and falls right off the bone with a light touch of the fork. Omg-- so good!

Really glad this spot has a home in Crown Heights. Definitely go!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

He's taken his home countries cooking and made it accessible without compromise. He won't add plantain which drives me nuts but he explained why.

I happened to see this place once or twice on the bus, and as I work in walking distance, decided to look up the menu. The choices were pretty good and decided to call in for a vegetarian bowl. They gave me an ETA and price, which was doable.

When you open the box, the smells and the colors were a lovely experience to the senses. I ordered the tofu bowl with coconut ginger sauce and brown rice. I actually had to show it off to my co-workers because it was so pretty and they all commented on how great it smelled. The tastes didn't disappoint either. It hit the spot and I didn't have feel at all bad about it. It gave me enough energy to power through the second half of the day. My coworker was inspired to try them too and she got the jerk chicken and gave the bowl rice reviews.

Give them a shot. There's a little something for everyone. It's great to support locals and their businesses, especially as Crown Heights is in the midst of gentrification.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"It's great!  I thought surely I had left a review for this place back when they opened and I popped in to see what this shiny new business was at the end of my block.  I fell in love then and am still there today.

The menu has gone through a few renovations since opening as you can see from my old pictures to now but the flavor is still consistently amazing.  These guys from St Vincent and the Grenadines do it right!  It's all of your West Indian cuisine favorites packed (in very generous portions) into gastronomically sound servings and selections. I'm big on the jerk chicken with the coconut ginger sauce. Do get this add then hit it with the spicy pepper sauce, but don't go too crazy if you're not with the spice because it will punch  you.  I also had the pleasure of tasting the tofu (thanks vegetarian girlfriend) and I would actually order it and enjoy if I were fasting from meat.  The red tomato based sauce is also a tasty alternative which I'd like to try on the chicken or goat the next time (with the pepper sauce too of course).

Finally do try the Sorrell. It's tasty.  I haven't had the pleasure of the other beverage options. Take it go because it travels well or take a seat at one of the large communal tables and make a few new friends through few words and a lot of chewing with your head down.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Thank you, Food Sermon, for opening and feeding us so deliciously these past few years. Everyone I bring to enjoy the pleasantries at Sermon leaves satisfied and impressed, even vegan health nuts like me. The vibes are positive and staff are friendly and helpful. The delicious food is high-end without the associated customer cost.

Keeping the curated menu minimal without any pages to turn and too many decisions to contemplate allows for easy focus by both diners, and the chefs who are perfecting the meals. The owner, chef Rawlston Williams, regularly is engaged with patrons with whom there is easy-going camaraderie.

The relaxed environment and its decor are thoughtful and comforting, and the artwork is intriguing. The corner location allows for good people-watching on Rogers Ave. For amusement, note the deli across the street has an illuminated sign stating they are (open) ""25/7."" Talk about dedication. ;-)

What a testimony of hard work and passion Food Sermon is, particularly when the ""new"" restaurants in the vicinity cater to ""new"" residents, and not the traditional West Indian diaspora who have built this community for generations. The neighborhood has seen good Caribbean eateries come and go; few if any achieved the level of holistic grace (particularly the welcoming interior decoration style) of Food Sermon.

The city offers but a few high-quality West Indian restaurants that genuinely are delightful, and not polarized between being overpriced/overhyped/pretentious/glamorous (Negril Village) and the uninspired plexiglass walls of tasty take-away (the shuttered vegetarian Ital Shak, also [formerly] on Sullivan Pl). I still mourn the loss of beautiful Raw Star and Green Paradise opened by Trinidadian raw food chef, Mawule Jobe-Simon.

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"The ironic thing about visiting this location is that I lived in this block for seven years before this location was transformed into this restaurant.

My trusted friend and chef "" Mr Cutters "" recommended this location and said that I had to check it out.

I really like the open kitchen concept where you can see the master chef at work. This has to be one of the cleanest kitchen I has seen. This is supported by their "" A "" rating.
This is not the traditional Caribbean restaurant as it caters to  more healthy food options while still embracing the authenticity of a Caribbean heritage.

The name "" Food Sermon "" is justified once you have the the food. The plating is modern with its own twist. The only downside is that I wish the portions were a little bit more. Yes, it's that good that I want more.

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"I have been trying to eat at The Food Sermon for a while now. They have sort of strange hours which never seemed to coincide with my schedule - they are closed Friday night and Saturday all day and they don't open til 2 on Sundays. They are open weeknights 5-10, but not for lunch during the week. The hours are really the only downside of the restaurant.

Once I finally had the food, I figured out how they could stay in business with such scant weekend hours. The food is good. It's realllllly good. Based on older reviews, it looks like they may have had a larger selection in the past - I see mention of roti, etc. Now the menu is quite limited and simple.

1. Choose your protein (lamb, jerk chicken, salmon, tofu/veg)
2. Choose your bean (kidney or chick pea)
3. Choose your rice (brown or white)
4. Choose your sauce (spicy tomato or coconut ginger)

That's pretty much it. There are some vegetable sides, but there aren't any apps, soups, etc. At first, I was a little bummed about the lack of variety but once I had the food, I can see why they chose to limit the selection. Everything is made with such precision and love and it's really perfect.

The lamb shank is $18 and is gigantic. I don't know where else you can get such a gourmet item at that price point. It is cooked to perfection and falls off the bone, perfect and tender. The jerk chicken is $13 and delectably spicy. I got the coconut ginger sauce on the chicken and the spicy tomato sauce on the lamb - next time I would probably switch it up.

I can't wait to come back and try the salmon. I never get salmon in restaurants, but I have a feeling it would be perfect with that coconut ginger sauce. Mmmmm.

I left super satisfied - the portions are big - but everything seemed so clean and healthy and I didn't feel greasy or weighed down by my meal. The Food Sermon has a convert!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

It was just pure FIIIRRRRRRRRREEEEEE. I do not eat Caribbean food often so I may not have experienced the best, but I do know the food here is absolutely yummy. Sadly I forgot what I ordered so I don't remember what was in it]: BUT everything about the dish was just amazing. I think I might have gotten the lamb bowl? Not sure. The meat was soooooooooooo tender it tore apart with the slightest touch with a fork. It wasn't dry one bit. Full of juiciness and deliciousness. I can't get over how good it was omgggggg. We had a bone piece of meat and ya boy was just licking and sucking the bone after the meat was killed. It was so succulent and juicy. UNREAL. The sauce and seasoning with the meat was the best combination ever. The sauce was so creamy and added more layers of flavor to the already juicy meat. The rice was just fluffy and soft. Not undercooked or overcooked. Just right.

My only complaint is that the place itself was hot inside. AC wasn't on or anything. Just a fan. That was kinda dreadful during the summer, but I'd put up with it just to eat here again.

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"This is the first time I am struggling to find the right words to describe a dining experience. The words that come to mind are warm, inviting, home, comfort, love, and lip smacking good! There is a reason this place has earned a 5 star rating on yelp, simply put it is amazing!

When I am craving a homey meal that's full of flavor I head to the food sermon. The offerings here are a wide range of island flavors with a healthy twist. Nothing here is overly salted but still manages to be fully flavored. I've sampled the island bowls which come with your choice of white or brown rice, your choice of meat, chickpeas, and a choice of the tomato or coconut curry sauces. I can never decide between the two amazing sauces so I always ask the owner to surprise me.

Speaking of the owners here, these guys are the friendliest, courteous and helpful people I have met. They even always manage to remember their customer which provides a nice feeling. They are always willing to offer suggestions and give you samples if you are having a hard time making a choice.

I have tried most of the menu items and I cannot say anyone thing isn't given as much love and care as the other. These guys cook with a passion and it is evident in everything they make. I am not a fan of the sorrel drink, but these guys had me drinking it like it was a tall cool glass of red kool aid on a 90 degree day! I highly recommend the drink to accompany any of the tasty dishes at the food sermon.

My favorites and the must try dishes include the island bowl with your choice of sauces, and meat, the roti, and the curry goat. I am so happy to have this place in the neighborhood and I hope they stick around for a long time and expand!

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"WHO: moi
WHY: recommendation of my sister
WHAT: (Deets) I ordered the Lamb, brown rice, red beans and coconut ginger sauce. The on-the-bone sweet lamb meat was fall-off-the-bone tender(no knife needed), and perfectly seasoned. It's tipped with bread crumbs, to add texture and a nice crunch, and a green cilantro sauce. The red beans and rice were good with the coconut ginger sauce, but I will likely pair the sauce with the chick peas the next time around. To drink, I had the sorrel. It was a bit lemony for my taste. I'll skip it next time. There is plenty of tap water available at this (mostly) self-serve establishment. There are single seaters (and outlets) near the window for people watching and such. There is also a bench & a high top for parties of 4-6/ table. I like the repurposed wood and rustic feel of the place. The art and old school calypso and reggae were kool too.

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Holy smokes. Whole food, healthy ingredients, lean, delicious, and no frills no foo foo. Order at the cashier and grab yourself a drink and sit down, food comes out, casual style, but the deliciousness is anything but.

Fresh, delicious food is popular these days, but it usually comes at ridiculous prices. What with our whole organic and free trade movements, I understand that things are pricy. But what you get at The Food Sermon is a well priced meal that keeps you dreaming about returning, I wish I worked in the area as I would lunch here every day.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Definitely worth every penny.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"The Food Sermon, the most appropriate name because this place is The Gospel for Caribbean food. All of the dishes I ate from TFS were delicious: the Roti skin was light and airy, the stewed chicken was tender and well seasoned, the salmon with coconut ginger sauce was yummerz, pumpkin, chick peas and lightly flavored sorrel was not syrupy and similar to a Teavana tea. The flavors are slightly different from your local grab and go Caribbean restaurant and you can tell that the seasonings were carefully chosen to provide a perfected dish. The dishes here are full of rich color, which is always a good indication of a balanced meal.

It was awesome to be greeted ""Hello"" complimented with a smile, and sent off with ""Thanks for coming"" no ""push up"" faces here. The food is of restaurant quality and the open kitchen lay out gives you comfort seeing your food be prepared. There is an awesome chill out vibe here and the decor is welcoming and homey. The food is fairly priced but you feel like you have gotten a deal based on the quality. Let the church say ""Amen""! Because The Food Sermon gave the good word.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"I picked up dinner for 2 friends and myself the other night and was not disappointed. I got brown rice, chickpeas, and jerk chicken with the coconut ginger sauce and it was AWESOME. I wish I could get food from here more often. Everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly. Their kale is also very good and I would live off their roasted potatoes if I could.

My only complaint is it's a little difficult to time. I've read reviews that it took people 30-40 minutes to get their food after they just walked in to order, so I tried to call ahead and schedule an order for pick-up. The guy told me that he couldn't estimate when food would be ready and that if I wanted to place an order over the phone, I couldn't schedule when I wanted to pick it up - it would be ready when it was ready. That's a little frustrating and I find it hard to believe they can't figure out how to have an order ready an hour from the time a customer calls.

Their hours are a little wonky but if you can find the time to go when they're open, it's well worth the money!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Absolutely a hidden gem in Brooklyn! Well, I'm not familiar with Brooklyn but this place makes me want to come back!

The store has its unique atmosphere. Wooden tables, very cool staff who tells you the exact time of wait before you order. So basically you choose the protein (fish, chicken or lamb) and then your toppings and sauce. We got one order chicken and one of lamb with different sauce for each. They were both so good. The fish is seared salmon, very fresh and has baked crumbs on top. The chicken is grilled chicken, fully flavored and goes so well with everything in the bowl. Did I mention they make their own hot sauce as well, bottled ones?

Overall it's a bit pricey but totally worth it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Three words - real life food. All of it was delicious: kale, button mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, garbanzo beans, brocoli, nicely seasoned tofu, all atop a bed of delicious brown rice. The sauces are ridiculous, for my bowl I had the coconut ginger but also tried the spicy tomato and both were perfectly suited for the food. Don't sleep on that hot sauce either, it packs a punch!

My only complaint is that some of the veggies (brocoli and snow peas) seemed like they were cooked a tad too long. That being sad, the flavor was never compromised, and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. Got takeout so didn't spend time inside but I do know that it was intended to be a stand alone catering business. So glad we are able to partake in non-catered situations!

Side note - I've heard meat is a good option here although the owner was raised vegetarian! I wouldn't eat it, but I've heard rave reviews. Good food = happy soul.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Soooooo delicious and I always get two meals out of it! When you eat-in the dinnerware is really nice too. My one ""negative"" is the sorrel isn't available to order when you order online and truly is a disappointment.

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Great owner/chef , Great kitchen, Greater food. Food Sermon doesn't shy away from their identity. Their identity is somewhat ahead of it's time this particular area but they are still thriving . Their identity in regards to food is simple. It's striking that difficult yet attainable balance of exceptional taste while still remaining healthy. It's modified caribbean food with a flare!

I have tried their stew chicken, oxtail ,roti minis and grilled chicken meals and they are all very very good. My favorite would be the oxtail. They aren't stingy with the amount of meat they give either which I can appreciate . They have however given me a less than desirable ratio of rice to beans with my stew chicken and oxtail meals which led to me tossing out half of the rice to balance out. A small gripe for an otherwise spectacular tasting and very healthy meal.

Their roti minis can be taken up a notch if you ask for the tamarind sauce they keep in the back.

The smells when i walked in slapped me smiling. It was a complete experience for me. My insides were filled with butterflies, my mouth watering and I could not stop smiling. To top it off, I requested a bottle of 100% coconut water, which they did not carry. A very kind gentle man went out of the establishment got me a bottle at no cost. This place is sooo dope.

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Very underwhelmed with the food. Was excited, given the hype the place got on Yelp but it tasted pretty average. I got the fish with chickpeas and kale and coconut milk. I thought the coconut milk with be cooked in with the fish rather than just put in separately, tasted like it came straight out of the can, which made the whole thing kind of bland. I even put a generous amount of pepper sauce over the whole bowl to add more flavor but couldn't get rid of the purely coconut milk-y taste. Fish was tasty but I wouldn't pay for another meal here.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

So basically they make a variety of carribean bowls, called island bowls. You choose your rice, type of beans, protein and then your sauce. I got white rice, kidney beans, jerk chicken with the coconut ginger sauce. It was delicious. You get a really nice sized portion. You order then if you stay they bring the dish to you. Also got the sorrel. Not the best sorrel I've had but it was fine.  I can't wait to go back for another bowl.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

My friend had jerk seasoned chicken with rice, red beans, and spicy tomato sauce. I chose chicken with rice, chickpeas, and coconut ginger sauce. Both dishes were absolutely wonderful. We also ordered sides of potatoes and mushrooms--both were delicious and paired well with our main courses. The establishment itself is very modest, but don't let that fool you.

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"For this review, I'm challenging myself to do a list dedicated strictly to the dish I tried. I figure if I'm ever to become a food critic, I should be able to describe food in depth. So before we get into the details, here's an overview of what I had. I decided on the Panko crusted salmon topped with scallions over brown rice and chickpeas with a coconut ginger sauce. Below is my list of critiques:

1. Coconut Ginger Sauce: It was more coconut than ginger. Very light and sweet. I'm a sauce lover so I would have liked to have more of it inside of the bowl.

2. Panko crusted salmon: this was a filleted, skinless cut. I was delightfully surprised at the portion size. Most places are skimpy; luckily, the Food Sermon is not. Cooked medium well. The crunchy texture was a good addition to the bowl.

3. Rice and chickpeas. Impossible to mess these up. Unless you're like me and don't have a rice cooker and are prone to multi-tasking while cooking so you usually end up with gooey rice. The cooks here obviously don't have that problem. The rice texture was perfect and the chickpeas too. No seasoning here and the coconut ginger sauce was not plentiful so I pulled a Beyoncé. Yup hot sauce out my bag. Ok not really, but the server offered it and it helped fulfill my need of sauciness.

Overall, I think the dish was good. Do I have to go back for it at least once a week or twice a month? Not likely. But the people are nice and I like the Caribbean take on the build-your-own-bowl.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"History:
I feel food Sermon has been around for a while even when I was in College. I just was either too engulfed in my work at school to notice or I was just to lazy to walk down the street to enjoy the food that comes out of that establishment.
Food Sermon is located in a very historical area of Brooklyn Crown Heights to be exact. Food Sermon isn't not too far from a lot of historical schools as well such as Clara Barton H.S., Medgar Evers Prep, and Medgar Evers College. Food Sermon is also 2 blocks down from Ebbets Field where the Brooklyn Dodgers used to play from 1913 to 1957.
If you take a stroll around the area you'll notice that a lot of streets are named after famous ppl ppl that built a legacy for themselves and Honorary delegates whom made a serious impact on the community.
For such a small place it gets the crowd from different parts of NY and out of state.

Pros:
Food here is very filling.
This place is small but, it produces excellent rich food.
Sundays are it's most busiest day because they make up for Saturday which they are closed which is understandable. Certain bowls or dishes are pricier than others side but; the food is 5 star so the prices make up for it. It was also pricey because I ordered 3 to go plates. I was greedy!
Food Sermon is a Church Sermon that is a blessing to my stomach.

Cons:
Food Sermon is very small.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Very small place, not a place to go out to eat, pick up is the way to go. We went there with 6 people for the first time after seeing so many 5 stars reviews and to be honest foods were 5 stars worthy but atmosphere to eat in was heh a bit messy. It was 92 degrees outside and 179 degrees inside or so it felt but BYOB ftw. Few glasses of wine and their amazing island bowls with coconut ginger just made all worth it! We have tried 3 out of 4 in the menu as I didn't care about tofu neither did my family.

Lamb shank was Devine just get it and if you don't like it put it in my tab!! Jerk chicken was great and salmon was good(if it was some other fish that wasn't so fishy I would loved it a lot) .

Note: ** Don't even bother with the other sauce but the ginger coconut and try the chick peas as the bean was mehh.

**Do not try this ""eating in"" in a hot summer day , do take out!

** Bring your own BOOZE

BON appetite!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Three words: Coconut Ginger Sauce

This is the best sauce on the menu by far. I tried the rice bowls which both tofu and lamb, they are dangerously good. It is primarily take out restaurant, and they could get really busy, they are closed on Saturdays due to religious reasons. Be prepared to wait because the food can take up to 45 minutes to prepare.

I went and got myself the chicken bowl topped with sweet potatoes and beans and it was amazing, the taste of the meat and how tender it was...  I'm pretty sure this is influenced by caribbean culture but I'm not sure which country.

The Food Sermon Kitchen,Still loving this place. Its really really popular now which is great. Im glad their business is doing well and they'll be a fixture in the area. They have cut down some of the items on the menu. I dont really mix any of the items too much the most superb of their dishes made the cut. Ive been here so many times and everytime I feel the warmth and love they put into this place. It comes out in their attitudes and the food. The one downside is the prices have gone up.

I also tasted the curried goat roti- I liked the sauce and the chick peas but I am not a fan of goat... The piece I tasted had so much chewy fat on it that I had to spit it into my napkin.

The menu descriptions are straightforward and don't accurately describe the complexity of the flavors. The tofu was crisp, the rice and beans were perfectly cooked, and the flavors of the sauce were incredible. Vegan or otherwise, you have to go here.

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"What can i say. This food was absolutely divine and so fresh. I happen to be in the area on this lovely Monday evening and decided to treat myself to a nice meal. I yelped some places and this place came up in one of my searches. I always pass this spot in the morning whilst driving to work and always wondered what it was.

I checked out the yelp reviews and drove my blueberry [ the name of my car] to the kitchen. It had just opened for the evening and did not disappoint. I was being greedy so ordered curry goat roti and a side order of mac and cheese. Lets not forget the sorrel. It was so fresh and didn't have the strong kick of ginger, which I usually like, but i could taste notes of it along with blueberry.

The roti was so good. Fresh and warm. The meat came out on a bed of warm sweet potatoes with chick peas. The mac and cheese wasn't greasy like they sell at the Caribbean spots on flatbush, i was cheesy and flavorful.

I will definitely be back here again! Got to try their Mauby and their oxtails.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Jerk Chicken (nice flavor and it is actually spicy)
White rice/ red beans
Coconut ginger sauce

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Food Sermon is a caribbean take on the Chipotle model of food. Make a limited menu of items and serve it in a limited combination of dishes.

I got the Jerk Chicken on a spicy tomato sauce over rice and beans. First thing's first: this isn't the jerk chicken you're used to if you actually like Carribbean food.

It's all meat, its missing the smokey skin so you don't get the true flavor that comes from the Jerk sauce and rub. The spicy tomato sauce was also... not very spicy. But I will point out this about the tomato sauce: it's not really my type  of thing (not a fan of tomatoes), but I haven't seen it anywhere else.

They do have a separate pepper sauce that you can use and that one is quite spicy, but overall it's clear that the demographic for the Food Sermon Kitchen is white people.

The food is sanitized, it's safe, it appears exotic but really isn't. And it costs $14 for a decent portion that you can finish in one sitting. For about $10 you can get enough Jerk chicken at any other Caribbean eatery to make you sick of chicken for an entire week.

Which is to say : Food Sermon serves gentrified Carribbean food. The food is good but it's not a great value and not going to be what you're used to in terms of Caribbean food.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,Amazing!!!! I had the Jerk Chicken Bowl with the Ginger Coconut Sauce and Red Beans. The flavors married beautifully together. The presentation was pleasing and just all around vibe and decor was great. I will definitely come back.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"I recently moved back to New York from North Carolina and I admit I was spoiled for a little while. I always had my mother, who is Jamaican by the way, to cook for me everyday and now that I'm away, I miss it! So when I came across this place I fell in love. It's so hard to find a Jamaican spot that has great food. Especially compared to my mother.

Anyway, my first visit I had the Chicken Island Bowl with the coconut sauce and the Curry Goat Roti (I was hungry that day). The roti is thicker than I'm used to but no complaints. The coconut sauce for the island bowl was different, but I loved it. I'm glad they aren't just making the ordinary dishes and are putting a spin on things. But, yea it was great I was stuffed and satisfied when I left that day.

My second visit, I wanted to try something new and they recommended the salmon island bowl. Even though I don't usually get fish at restaurants, I tried it anyway and It was amazing. It was seasoned well and complimented the coconut sauce that I chose to have with it.

So overall, great place, I love their presentation with the dishes as well.

I will be a regular!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Perfect hot dinner for a Sunday before getting the work week started.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"So I'm gonna get straight to the point. The food they have coming out of this kitchen is great. The one thing I appreciate is their focus on what they do well and sticking to it (meaning, the menu does not have a lot of variety but enough to satisfy island folk looking for some good cooking. And like i said, it was great!!)

I've had the food sermon kitchen bookmarked as a place i needed to visit for the past year and just never found myself in that part of Brooklyn when they were open. Today though, I made it a point to get over there. My wife ordered and I waited in the car, so i cannot speak on the service first hand. However, she knows the general manager from back in the day and he so happened to be working today. Came from the back when he recognized her and exchanged pleasantries.

We ordered the jerk chicken bowl with white rice, red beans and the coconut ginger sauce (no pic, sorry) & the lamb shank with brown rice, red beans, a side of kale and the coconut ginger sauce. We ordered to go since we had to trek back to the island and I really didn't want to waste time trying to eat in. We decided that we would crack one of the bowls (to go box) and the lucky winner was the jerk chicken bowl...holy cow. The flavor in that thing is something to preach about. There was a nice kick to it and the addition of the coconut ginger sauce?!?! (Faints in disbelief). Lol. It was that good. When we got home I cracked open the lamb shank box/bowl and the meat just fell off. My wife loved the kale. Now, if I had to choose, I would say the jerk chicken was the best (yea, I've read the other reviews praising the lamb shank as the best meal on the menu, but I may have to disagree on that one)....

Glorious healthy Caribe fare makes me forlorn that we didn't buy that Bklyn apartment 10 years ago like I'd wanted. Sigh.

- Food here is absolutely awesome !!!!!!
- I had stew chicken roti, apple salad (with chicken and avocado), lamb island bowl and all were amazing
- Everything taste so well prepared and fresh

- The soundtrack is great as well

- The only downside is seating, it's more 'grab and go' and less 'hang out.'

The restaurant has an eclectic vibe to it, with it's Vincentian inspired art, open kitchen concept and communal seating.  2 of us ordered the lamb, 1 ordered salmon and 1 the jerk chicken. I sampled them all and they were amazing but the salmon..... probably the best I've ever had.  The owner/chef is very hospitable and friendly as was the cashier. I had the lamb, white rice, chickpeas with the spicy tomato sauce and also ordered a veggie medley of kale, mushrooms, broccoli and pumpkin. So delicious! I also had the sorrel which was decent.

First and foremost. It is nice to see more BLACK business owners coming up in the neighborhood. Crown Heights is starting to feel like how it felt when I was a kid growing up.

Why? I wrote a review - the owner reached out to offer us an on the house dish to replace my burnt salmon. And I loved it! I shared the word and I made a mental note to write an updated review... months ago :-(

The jerk chicken from here ... will change your life. One of the ONLY places I will go for jerk chicken since some places seek to engulf your mouth in flames.

Definitely long overdue with this review, but the food was amazing. Huge portions that make for great food art. I also enjoyed the service, they are very attentive and great personalities.

Mason jars, wooden tables, art to be sold hanging on the wall bit with a touch of West Indian music in the background.

The food is made to order but the wait was worth it. Friendly staff who enjoy what they do.

I ordered the tofu bowl with chickpeas, spicy tomato sauce, brown rice and vegetables. Everything was seasoned to perfection. They even put some pepper sauce on the side...

My coworkers ordered the salmon and lamb shank. Both of them could not stop the compliments from rolling off their tongue. The lamb shank was cooked so well, the meat was falling off the bone. The salmon was flaky and seasoned very well. The kale that was in each of the bowls were still in the most greenest form, sautéed beautifully.

I was very skeptical because of the price. The portion was huge I split it with my son and I still had some left over. They def didn't skimp on the ingredients and the chicken was good quality, so I understand. I do not eat lamb but I may have to make an exception. I'm sure the tofu/veggie is tasty also.

The lamb is amazing fall of the bone goodness, but can take about 20 min to prepare, so call ahead if you are going to pickup.  Also if you try to order soon after they open, be prepared that lamb may not be available yet. Always tears when that happens

Spicy tomato vs ginger coconut... I usually go with the coconut, creamy mild ginger flavor that I can always use leftovers on my own cooking :)

My only reason for 4 stars is that while the prices are reasonable for the main, I dislike having to pay for each additional add on.  The bowl has no veges if you like to have a balance, so I typically end paying more to add broccoli/kale etc.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

Takes about 20-25 min for average dinner prep. Would not recommend this place for a large dinner party or a special date.. Unless you are into super casual. Plus parking is sparse.

This restaurant truly stands out in quality and taste...better than anything we've had so far...considering there are mediocre at best Caribbean restaurants located on every block-smh.

It's such a classy homage to the best of what this neighborhood has to offer.

I had the Island Bowl with lamb, which first of all was gorgeous - a whole lamb shank just perched in the middle of some beautifully cooked rice, chickpeas and coconut ginger sauce (and ask for tamarind sauce, it's behind the counter!). First off, I almost made a fool of myself by asking for a knife, but I'm glad I bit my tongue, because as soon as I touched the shank, it fell apart beautifully under my fork and was so succulent and tender. The spice was perfect, and the panko gave such a nice addition to the texture and complemented the taste beautifully. All of the flavors were ON POINT.

The portion was huge, but I'm a relatively small person, and I inhaled that thing, with only a few bits of rice and chickpeas to take home for leftovers. I just couldn't stop eating!!!

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"I try not to give 5 stars to any place that I have been to only once, but this place deserves every single star.

Where to start!?

The staff - Warm and welcoming you instantly feel like a distant family member coming for a family reunion, they smile with you and laugh with you. They are very kind and accommodating. I cannot even begin to imagine anything BUT friendly interactions with them.

The food - the food is DELICIOUS comfort food that I would eat daily. It was not greasy, or hip and healthy. It was something a good cook would make in their kitchen for dinner. There are two portion sizes if I recall correctly, small and large. I had the large chicken bowl with spicy tomato sauce and brown rice. It was not a portion which left me hungry nor left me hating myself and being overstuffed. However if you are petite you may find it a bit much, if unsure ask them the difference between the sizes and they will show you the small and large bowl in which you will get your food. A small tofu dish and large chicken dish + tap water cost us under $20. And the water was served in cool jars with handles.  

Atmosphere - Clean and elegant place, I felt very comfortable and relaxed while eating inside. Not noisy, you can share an intimate moment while enjoying delicious food.

Verdict - After a job in the park come in for delicious food which will not make you hate yourself and feel bloated while not breaking your wallet. A must check-out spot when in the area!

I wanted to try a little of everything so this seemed to be the ticket. There was a small sampling of each over brown rice with red beans.

My children's favorite was the white rice with chickpeas and their side of seasoned potatoes.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,Praises to the chef! This food was absolutely amazing...I enjoyed every morsel. Unfreakingbelievable!!! You must try the mini roti curry chicken or goat  (the meat is so tender). I didnt stop there...the caribbean island bowl is delish both sauces are exquisite. But don't forget to enlighten your palate with a glass of chilled sorrel... it is smooth and refreshing. You must experience this for yourself!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"The Island Bowl with lamb was gigantic and delicious! The lamb fell right off the bone, and I felt silly asking for a knife. The brown rice chic peas were good. I wish there were some veggies on the plate, just a little for some crunch. The ginger coconut broth was great.

I will return for the oxtail and the roti, looking to try the goat and stewed chicken.

A must try if you live nearby or willing to explore away from Nostrand and Franklin.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"A complete home run.

The Food Sermon team has taken the spicy, tangy and occasionally funky flavors of the Caribbean, and without dumbing them down in the slightest, created something new. Each bowl is a feast for the eyes, nose and most importantly the mouth.

This really is a kitchen, so it can take a while to get food when the demand kicks in. And with the bright and festive space and wonderful cuisine, that seems to be pretty frequently. You can, however, leave your order to be picked up later. We managed to have a pint and grab our dishes to go.

With a perfect 5 star rating, crowds of people and raves from the New York Times and elsewhere,  Rawlston Williams is clearly going places. Enjoy the food here before the expansion, franchising, Manhattan and Vegas spin-offs or all of the other big things that are clearly ahead for this man. Bravo.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"EXCELLENT!

Ordered the Island Bowl with Brown Rice and Lamb.  Good size portion and I couldn't stop eating.  Everything complimented each other and I strongly believe that the Sermon was well delivered. :)

It is not a sit down restaurant as others have mentioned, so keep this in mind before visiting.

Best wishes and continuous growth.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

This place has amazing food! I got the lamb bowl and it got better with each bite. The lamb fell off the bone so you know it's doin something right. I got it with the coconut ginger sauce which took it to the next level. The red beans and rice that came with it was amazing too, you gotta go with that. I highly recommend you support this business!

The Food Sermon Kitchen,"Amazing. Iconic. Great. Wonderful. Delicious. Exquisite. I could go on and on about how great this food is, because it's truly amazing. I've gone to Food Sermon twice and it's worth every penny. I stretch my meals into two, but you really can eat it in one sitting if you so choose. My sister and I went back yesterday, and I got the salmon, broccoli, and rice with red beans in the coconut ginger sauce. The coconut ginger is not overwhelming at all, it's a great mild flavor that really compliments the flavors of the rest food. My sister got the lamb, male, rice and red beans with coconut ginger sauce (which I got the first time) and absolutely loved it. The lamb is out of this world!!! If you don't have any dietary restrictions I would totallyyyyy get the lamb every time. The salmon is great for a lighter option, but the lamb is undefeated. I can't even compare it to anything. It falls off the bone every time, it's super succulent, and so flavorful - mixed with the coconut ginger and a touch of the in house hot sauce - OMG!! I honestly can't wait to go back so I can get it again. Their food, service, and ambience are great - Vaughn and the rest of the team are doing an amazing job!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"So, I live on the block and had purposely avoided going to this place for two reasons:
1 - I was disappointed that they put yet another Caribbean restaurant in the neighborhood
2 - I was tired of eating Caribbean food
Now that my break from Caribbean food is over, I decided to give the Food Sermon a try. First off, kudos for the decor. It's hip, there is great use of space, and it's welcoming. I think they did a fantastic job. I ordered my food and sat down patiently until it was ready. It didn't take too long. I ordered chicken and Kale with some type of tomato/pumpkin sauce on the side The chicken was flavorful, moist, and had a bit of a kick to it which I liked. The kale was pretty good and mixed with the chicken made for a pretty good dish. Now lets have a talk about that tomato/pumpkin tasting sauce that is on the side (thank God). Uh uh, didn't like that at all. It was bland and added absolutely nothing to the dish. The best part about it was that I could just ignore it and continue on with the rest of my food. Although the food was pretty good, and it was quite refreshing to see a place that elevated Caribbean food while still keeping it affordable, it isn't a place that I could see myself ordering from frequently. It is however, a great addition to the neighborhood after all.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants
The Food Sermon Kitchen,"When I walked into this place and I smelled the air, I knew I made a good choice. The restaurant is small with not much seating which makes me think this place would be better for just take out rather than dining in. My husband got the Jerk Chicken bowl, in a spicy tomato broth, with brown rice, and red beans. I opted for the Lamb Shank Bowl, in the coconut ginger broth, with white rice, and chickpeas along with some roasted potatoes and mushrooms on the side. When the food arrived, I was astonished by the portion size. Even better than the portion size was the flavor! The food came out hot, fresh, and flavorful. Initially there was a mixup with my order and when I brought it to their attention, they were very quick to take care of it without much discussion. If you're looking for looking for a hot delicious meal with Caribbean flavor, this place is worth being on your list!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-food-sermon-kitchen-brooklyn-2?osq=restaurants

I'm a vegetarian (the curried tofu is just...yes) but according to my boyfriend the lamb is ""the f*cking bomb"". The interior is small and there are only a few counter seats but I highly recommend eating in (though take-out is just as good food wise) because you can really see the pride the owners/workers have in the place.

The menu is pretty straight forward. They have some salads and sandwich options with a good variety of entrees that each come with two sides and corn bread, We tried their President Barack Obama fried chicken with homemade baked macaroni and cheese and string beans. The food was tasty and big enough for us to share.

Overall it was a solid spot that I would come to again if I am in the area.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"So, I've had Amy Ruth's before when I went to an event & it was catered by Amy Ruth's & I wasn't really impressed. My sister was with me at the event & felt the same. I've never eaten here before, but my sister had & said her experience was about the same as when we went to the event. I came here on a Sunday afternoon with family for lunch & had a good overall experience.

We had a party of 8 & was told prior on Sunday's they don't reservations, but call the day of to give them the heads up & that's what we did. Upon arriving, we were told we can't be seated til all of our party is there. Once we were all there, we waited about 5-7 mins & was brought to their upstairs dining area & seated at a round table. Conversation wise, I prefer a round table, than a long table, it just makes it easier.

For our entrees my family ordered smothered turkey wings, chicken wings, whitening fish & baked catfish. Some of our sides were collard greens, mashed potatoes, string beans, mac & cheese, yams, string beans & okra. My family said their food was good. Now one of my sisters & I had the baked catfish with mac & cheese & yams. The mac & cheese & yams was fine. The sharp cheddar was definitely shining through in the mac & cheese. What both my sister & I were confused about was the gravy on the baked catfish with onions & green peppers. Normally when catfish is baked there's no gravy added. My onions & peppers weren't that hot either, although the rest of my food was. Any Ruth's also gives out complimentary corn bread when seated. For beverages we had half & half, hot tea & my cousin had a corona.

Our food came out quickly even with a party of 8 & the waitress was nice & attentive. After eating as well, they came around to take our dishes & asked if we needed any to go boxes. This experience with the food was better than the one I had a few years ago.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"You know, I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I came here with family last night while I was in town for a conference and they were visiting. This is definitely a ""down home"" sort of place on the inside. I really enjoyed the walls, which are all painted mural-style with faces of famous African Americans in history. A really nice touch (and the artists did a good job, to boot).

I ordered the jerk chicken, and while the chicken breast itself was a little dry, the jerk seasoning was the bomb! Some auntie put her foot in the mac & cheese, too (for the non-Southern speakers, that means it was really good)! The mashed potatoes were thick and buttery.

Note that they have Uptowns, aka half lemonade and half sweet tea, which always makes me feel at home. There is also a Kool-Aid of the Day, complete with a gallon of sugar to a gallon of water--the signature ratio.

It's no frills in here but it's not trying to be frilly, which is fine with me.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amy Ruth's,"Food was average however on this occasion I was given the wrong order. Once I returned home to south jersey I realized I was given a catfish dinner instead of the fried chicken dinner I ordered. I immediately called the restaurant and told the girl who served me and took payment. She informed me they would be closing soon and I can call back the next day. I went back to the restaurant the next day and was met with pure disrespect. I was also told it was an error on their part however I would still have to pay for the correct order. I left the catfish there the same way it was given to me , paid another $20+ for the correct order and vowed never to bring my family or ever go here again myself.

I went with my sister and she got meatloaf and collard greens with cole slaw. The collard greens were one of my favorites. The coleslaw was much different then the cheap coleslaw you'll buy at kfc or the grocery stores. The vegetables are thick. It was interesting, and really worked for me. I was too full off of my chicken and waffle to taste her meatloaf. The only downside to this place I think is cleanliness. They need to put more cars into cleaning the area before seating customers. It was a little gross around me. That's what stopped me from giving this place 5 stars.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"My friend and I visited NYC for Memorial Day weekend. We wanted some soul food Saturday afternoon, so we did a quick Google search and came across Amy Ruth's. The reviews looked good, so we decided to give it a try.

We walked up and there was a short line, so we put our name on the waitlist. We were called and seated in no time. As soon as we sat down, a server came and greeted us. We ordered mimosas and waters to drink and then ordered our meals. After putting in our order, the server came back with a bread basket which was super good! The drinks were okay, but nothing to rave about.

For my meal, I ordered The State Senator Brian Benjamin, which are the fresh salmon croquettes. These were some of the best salmon croquettes I've EVER had! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside...so great! I ordered macaroni and cheese and collard greens as my sides, and these were less than desirable. The macaroni and cheese had a weird, almost sweet taste and the greens tasted a little sweet too. They looked great, but the taste didn't match how good they looked. I ate a few bites of each, but completely finished the croquettes.

This was a cute place, but I don't see the hype...maybe because I'm from the South and have tasted some of the most amazing soul food. But off the strength of the salmon croquettes alone, I'll give this an okay rating.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"The moment I asked our server what the kool aid flavor of the day was and he said red, was when I knew this would be good. The cornbread was a hard pass for me, but my husband said it was decent.

I ordered the Michele Obama. I've been craving fried fish and this was quite possibly the best fried fish I've ever had at a  restaurant. Perfectly seasoned and not greasy. Most importantly it didn't taste like the grease was old.

I had the collard greEns, Mac and cheese, and  potato salad for sides. The greens and Mac were amazing! The potato salad... well you can't win them all. It's not that it was bad, it just wasn't the greatest. Also it had carrots in it, I found that a little strange.

All in all this is one of the best soul food places ive eaten. Especially for something up north. Well done. I would definitely come back, I wanna try their desserts.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Came here on a Friday night and was seated right away. This is a no frills spot that has an *excellent* playlist filled with throwbacks and gives complimentary corn bread!

We ordered the Rev. Al Sharpton (we opted for the chicken breast) with a side of mac & cheese. The waffle was slightly crispy and sweet which paired well with the fried chicken breast. We were worried that the chicken breast would be dry but that, thankfully, was not the case here! Add some butter on the waffle and a nice drizzle of syrup - man, that hit the spot.

The mac & cheese on the other hand was way too salty for me so that was a little disappointing. Other than that, great spot that's open hella late on Fridays and Saturdays (until 5:30am!!).",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"We were satisfied with our dining experience at Amy Ruth's. The waiters served quickly so the wait wasn't bad even there were always lines.
Chicken and waffle is definitely a must try . Their chicken was really juicy with crispy fried layers and the texture of waffle wasn't dry at all.
My favorite was their complimentary corn bread which was really soft with great corn-smell.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Wow. I am so thankful my friends brought me here.

Where to even start?
The food is INSANELY good. It definitely makes me feel like I'm back home in NC.

I split the William Allen we got mac and cheese and collard greens and of course corn bread. Holy cow. The flavors were incredible and there was SO much food. Incredible price for the amount of food you get.

I came in hungry and left stuffed!!

The service was great and you can definitely tell this place has charm and history.

I literally cannot wait to come back.

Amy Ruth's,"Came to this place on Saturday around 1 pm got seated right away. I don't think every time you will get this lucky since this place gets packed soon and by the time I'm leaving I see many people waiting outside.

Inside is pretty simple and I have ordered a chicken on a waffle as one of their most famous dishes. The waitresses also suggested that's their most popular dish! I also ordered an iced coffee rather than go with the traditional combination with soda! You know, it's Saturday.

My order was fast and it tastes amazing! I have to be honest that I come back to it twice after this experience. The fried chicken is the king!!! I have a deep love to chicken on waffle, and here is one of my favorite. Also, I have tried their peach cobbler, which is really good! They put a lot of peaches in it and totally worth the price. The desert wasn't that sweet and it was steaming warm when they bring it out.

The place locates in Harlem, so if you around the area, please try it! Sometimes, I think it is better than red rooster since it's so simple and down-to-earth.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"My boyfriend and I came here for some Southern food and while it had some good spots, there were a lot of not-so good spots as well.

Tried out the kool-aid of the day, which was grape, and it really does just taste like kool-aid.

The corn bread to start was quite good, being nice and warm. What followed was more mixed.

My boyfriend got the smothered pork chop with fried okra and Mac and cheese. The fried okra was cold by the time we got it. Had it been fresh it would have honestly tasted a lot better. The Mac and cheese had quite a bit of actual cheese on it which was nice, but still was missing that special touch.

The pork chop itself was a bit dry in parts, and really needed that sauce to make it taste good.

I had the chicken and waffles and it was okay. The chicken tasted pretty good, having a nice fried taste but could have been juicier. The waffle was kind of boring, and the texture was rather dry in parts.

Overall a decent place but could use a little quality control to make it even better.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I like the atmosphere proving lots of tables and seat, friendly environment and workers.  But food is not anything impressive except the size.  
What I did not like was that they put 15% tip automatically in our bill without explanation although we were only three of us.  I am not saying it was too much because I usually give 20% tip.  I just thought it was illegal in NYC unless it is for a large party.
I may go back to bring friends who wants to try soul food but will not go back for food for sure.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Harlem seems to be the #1 city for southern style Soul food. I enjoyed myself here! The indoor dining area is creative and relaxed. There is no need to dress up or be too formal. Murals of black history decorate the interior walls. It's like eye candy and a cultural experience at the same time. The art challenges your memory, if you know your history it's endearing.  As for the most important factor, I was not let down. Tasty menu items accompanied by celebrity themes intrigued me right off the bat.

The fried chicken, sautéed greens, cheesy grits, and catfish were amazing! The service also wonderful! All and all no complaints.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"So this is a staple in Harlem right. Been here a 3-4 times with a 2 month period and each and every time, either i find a strand of hair on my plate or the person I'm with does. That's gross. Each time they did apologize but the final time they just suggested a free dessert. No thank you. I came back a final time and think it'll be my last.

First off Amy Ruth's is NOT BLACK OWNED. It's owned by a Jewish 90 + year old man and his son. Matter of fact they own the block! I know because he came to offer me a dessert on the house and the server said he's the owner. Let that marinate.

Unfortunately A LOT of these black owned establishments aren't owned by us anymore. Just because it's soul food doesn't mean it's African Americans.

Favorite stop for Europeans and one got real nasty/rude with me in line and had to quickly tell her that her behavior will not and does not work here in the states. Europeans were seated after me, waited and served before me as well. I explained to waiter and didn't seem to care and i was just compensated for a dessert. Once again no thank you.

Btwn hair in my food and serving others before and offering to throw in a free dessert, I'm good on Amy Ruth's!",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"TLDR: Big portions of good soul food! Only down side is you'll want a nap afterward! Overall rating: A++

According to my research and a friend's advice this was the #1 place for soul food in Harlem! There might be a bit of a wait at times, especially on the weekends. We came here on a Tuesday at 6:30pm and there was no wait. A bouncer outside asked if we were dining in or taking out. He pointed us to a table inside for dine in. There's a back room as well. I was warned by my friend who suggested this place service might be slow but we were served in a timely manner. First we placed orders for the drinks then the food. Here's what we got:

-Complimentary corn bread: Delicious and moist, served with butter. A+

-The Rev. Al Sharpton (Chicken and waffle, fried or smothered) $17.50: I got the fried dark meat chicken. White mean is $1 extra. They proudly display on the menu that they use 100% pure Doerfler's maple syrup. I found the syrup to be kind of runny for my tastes. The chicken was fresh and crispy. Just the right amount of salt. I added hot sauce since that's my preference. It didn't need it though. The waffle was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. It was delicious! I really enjoyed my meal! This was a good portion for me but if you're extra hungry add a side. A+

-The President Barack Obama (Fried, smothered, baked or Bar-B-Q chicken; comes with a choice of 2 sides) $18.95: My friend got this with fried chicken, fried okra, and baked macaroni & cheese. The sides were very delicious! I was especially impressed with the fried okra! I didn't try her fried chicken since I already had my own. My friend also agreed the chicken was on point! A+

I got a gingerale and my friend got a beer. All in all a wonderful dining experience. When we were leaving a big group of 15 teenagers were seated in the back room. Glad we came before them! I would definitely come back. In the future I want try their peach cobbler/Neal Shoemaker, chicken and dumplings (ONLY on Tuesdays), Bar-B-Q pork spare ribs/The Nate Robinson!

We ordered fried chicken with Mac and cheese and candied yam and honey dipped fried chicken with collar green and cheese grits. The order came out only a quarter (leg and thigh) for each plate which costs $52 in total. Chicken is very over fried to the point that it tastes like chicken jerky. The sides are not good at all. Coolaid costs $3.50! Sweet tea cost $4!

Over priced with not good food. Would not recommend",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amy Ruth's,"My friends and I were SUPER hungry when we came here at midnight on Saturday after drinking heavily at an event. We stopped in Harlem at Amy Ruth's because on Saturdays, it's open all night - they close at 5:30AM. It was packed but my party of 3 was seated right away.

The service took a long time but we were kept busy with the corn bread and butter at the table. I ordered the honey dipped fried chicken with a side of mac n cheese and candied yams. My only regret was getting the chicken white meat because it was a little dry but the GLAZE?!? Oh my gosh it was finger licking good. The breading was crispy and crunch but not too thick. The chicken was fresh and well seasoned. The yams and Mac were good in flavor, but the yams were too sweet.

Honestly, it met my expectation in flavor - everything was delicious! Would definitely come back and get the ribs next time. The service was slow and I tried to ask a waiter a question and they looked at me and kept walking.....FYI - gratuity is included in the check.

Amy Ruth's,"Was it worth having lunch at this iconic Harlem eatery, absolutely! Would I come back, for sure.  Was it the best  fried chicken I ever had, no!

Ordered the Al Sharpton, which is chicken and waffles, added steamed cabbage and collard greens and had a half ice tea/half lemonade.

Collard greens, best I ever had!
Steamed cabbage, loved it.
Waffle, awesome, but not anything too different the other freshly made waffles.
Fried, white meat chicken quarter, very good, but here again the difference is very nuanced from other good fried chicken I have had.  
Drink, way way way, did I say way, too sweat.  Next time I will order half and mix it with water.  

One mistake I made, and don't make it too, is the way I ordered.  When you order the chicken and waffles and then your sides are a la carte the end result is a $40+ lunch bill. If you order from the sides included section (but no waffle offered) then the cost would be about $10-15 cheaper!

Super cool murals on the walls of iconic and historic black figures.  I should have snapped more shots, but wanted to be respectful.

Sooo the waffles were really good. I'm talking love at first bite. It was so good that I didn't want to share with nobody! My waffle was buttery, cakey and had just the right amount of sugar. Then it was the chicken and that was just meh!

Amy Ruth's is a soul food place located in the heart of Harlem. It's known for their many different pairings of waffle creations such as catfish and waffles, waffles and steak, waffles with fried shrimp, you name it they got it! I also love how the meals are named after great African Americans such as Al Sharpton, Gabrielle Union and Barack Obama.

When we arrived around 12:30pm, I had my heart set on ordering an entree however we were told that the chef was still in the process of closing out his breakfast so I had to settle for the chicken and waffles on their breakfast menu.

Once again their waffles- super yummy!! however the chicken was not great it wasn't bad but it wasn't standard soul food chicken. I was expecting the chicken to have the right amount of season and the crispity crunch instead I got plain basic fried chicken.

Amy Ruth's,"WHAT'S WITH THE HYPE? I can tolerate to some degree bad service; I just don't tip, but bad food and bad service, NOT. Amy Ruth's was OUT of black eyed peas, which proved to be a blessing in disguise. Everything was cold, unseasoned--just down right thoughtless. Mac & Cheese, or Cheese & Mac, tastes like a block of cheese; collard greens bland bitterness; and the mash potatoes fair no better. Sides are sub-standard to KFC whose food is basic drive-through.

The fried catfish was the MOST disappointing; wafer thin salt strips, best describe them. Like something you get from a sidewalk food cart. Suffered through the catfish (after a long day's work), but just couldn't stomach anything else. Drove 7 miles to Cheesecake factory for a Chinese Chicken Salad that saved the day!

Amy Ruth needs to get it together. Literally the worse so-called soul food I've every tasted, across the entire country. I love to support BOBs but, not those with low standards and poor quality food and service.

Amy Ruth's,"Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had! Bigger portions and more affordable than Red Rooster and just as good, if not better!

My boyfriend and I both got the Reggie Harris (honey-drizzled) and the chicken was to-die-for juicy and super crunchy even after being soaked in the best honey glaze.  I also love that you can choose your cut of chicken. I got the fried wings while my boyfriend got white meat, and they even gave him an extra wing!

The chicken was quality all around and you could tell the oil they fried it in was clean. The grits, Mac and cheese, and collard greens were fantastic and seasoned super well, but the corn was sub par (just tasted like corn from the frozen aisle with not enough salt or butter) but that won't stop me from coming here.

The staff were very friendly and made you feel right at home. You could tell they've been in the business for a while and really knew their stuff. Coffee was surprisingly good and they made sure our water was always full.

We got there at 11:30 on a Saturday morning with several parties ahead of us and only waited 10-15 min to be seated. I only wished the breakfast menu was available after 11:30am.

Amy Ruth's,"I have come here twice and while I love the neighborhood and the ambiance of this place (especially the Whitney Houston mural and other murals on the wall), I have sometimes felt the flavors are a bit lacking here somehow.

I came on a Thursday night for the Melita Smith special (jerked shrimp). And the ""spiciness"" was just an overwhelming amount of black pepper... it  was really overpowering and not in a pleasant way.

I had the fried okra, mashed potatoes, and Mac n cheese as sides. All were good but none were particularly great.

On a previous occasion, I tried the LLoyd Williams (waffle with boneless top sirloin steak). The waffle did not have any particular flavor or outstanding quality but it was decent. The sirloin steak was very filling which I appreciated but after a few minutes, it was under cooked and too chewy! I couldn't even cut it.

Amy Ruth's,"There's a definite reason why this place has been visited by so many famous individuals. If you're looking for great authentic soul food with the family like service then this is definitely the place to go to.

To start off, this place exudes the feeling of a family run place. The staff converse with each other like family and treat you as such, with respect and warmth. Once seated, the menu selection can be a bit daunting as there's so much to choose from but the staff can help you navigate their waters with ease.

For myself, I had the Rev. Al Sharpton (aka Chicken & Waffles). While simple of a meal it can be quite easy to mess this up. In particular, I've had many chicken and waffle combinations that are too dry for their chicken or the waffle isn't airy enough. Here, however, that wasn't the case whatsoever. In fact, I would be pleasantly surprised if someone didn't really like this dish as each item was well made. The chicken was surprisingly crispy on the outside with a nice crackle when puncturing but with a sweet juicy interior that you'd know and love from a chicken thigh/wing. To complement this savory taste the waffle is light and airy which helps it soak up the syrup and offset the salty flavors of the chicken well.

If none of those items were your kind of food then you'll have to really hate life to complain about their corn bread. Now, I really don't fare much with corn bread because often times it's just simply dry and gritty. This was probably some of the lightest corn bread I've had, almost like the texture of a slightly dense yellow cake with just the right amounts of corn to add sweetness to it. Add some butter and you've basically got a nice little snack right there.

In conclusion, come here for the great soul food but return cause the hospitality is great and their corn bread is simply amazing.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,Best Chicken and Waffles. Try it with any sides! Mmm I'm getting hungry just thinking about this dish.. please try. It's worth the wait but if you go for an early dinner the lines are less. You can also call and they will tell you what the line time looks like. Either way it's worth it! The rest of their menu is good too. I have had Thanksgiving dinner here a couple of years because I was too lazy to cook and it was just like being home.

My company and I did not mind the wait. Our server and support staff were very friendly. The establishment and restrooms were clean. Only issues were the wobbly table and incorrect charge for 2 half and half drinks (an extra $0.50) which our main server corrected.

The honey was not over bearing and just the right amount of crunch. The Mac and cheese was also good. I love a good baked Mac and cheese. Usually at a place like this they don't give you that much Mac and cheese, but not here, they have a good amount for me not to want anymore. The cabbage I had was also delicious. It was the right amount and cooked to perfection. My waiter was very friendly and honest about telling us what she liked on the menu. Doing this allowed us to make some really good food choices. Will be def coming back here.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Looking for some down home cooking for dinner, I visited Amy Ruth's up in Harlem for some fried chicken. It's easy to get to being only about a 1/2 block from the 116th street Subway station used by the 2 and 3 line. At night the area was a little sketchy so the short walk was appreciated. Walking inside it was busy on a Sunday evening. I ordered the President Barack Obama which is 1/4 chicken with two sides and cornbread for $18.45. Yes that's right almost $19 for a 1/4 chicken. Only in NYC! For the sides I went with mashed potatoes and gravy and black eye peas along with ice tea ($4). The food came out fast in about 5 minutes or so.

The chicken was very good southern fried chicken. Nice crust, juicy and hot in temp. Very good tasting chicken. Ditto the on the mashed taters with gravy and the peas. Tasted just like from home. This meal was very good in every aspect including prompt table service. With tax and tip my bill alone was $27.01! Only in NYC!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,Delicious. Go during the week if you can because it gets crowded. All the entree's are named are historically connected to Black American Culture as well as Civil Rights Leaders & Harlem.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"This was a treat. The only problem is that I couldn't decide which of the great entrees to choose from. I ended up going with the Obama chicken. My son went with the catfish and waffles. We were both more than satisfied.
We walked it off with a walk to the Apollo. Great night. The service was also perfect!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"The Good...Food was delicious. Fried Chicken, Mac and cheese (amazing), butter corn (nothing special). My 3 GFs had smothered pork chops (amazing), cabbage (amazing), mashed potatoes, chicken and waffle, fried okra.  The bad...Quite a few items were ordered and we were told after the fact that they were out I.e potato, rum cake.  No refill on Kool aid, come on it's Kool aid.  The ugly...our server. Not her looks, her attitude.  She basically took our order, came back to say they didn't have whatever and yep that's it.  A male helped us as she avoided us.  He was great.

I would have rated higher but her service was unacceptable.  

Food is worth it.  Enjoy",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"If you're in Harlem you have to eat at Amy Ruth's. I prefer to go on a weekday during less busy hours. We got there around 11:40 am on a Thursday and was seated immediately. Right after we sat down, we were served water and cornbread...banging! The waiter was friendly. We didn't wait long at all for our food. I got the chicken and a waffle but requested for my chicken to be honey-dipped...banging! It was really good. I read that Amy Ruth's was voted #2 for the best chicken and waffles in the country...I'm a believer!

I just love the vibe of this place; the history, culture, and southern food makes this place the gem that it is.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"There will more than likely be a wait for this place, but it's so worth it!

This amazing soul food spot has two floors that are almost always full.

They have a minimal bar stocked with beer and wine. Their mimosa carafe is always nice to share, and the Harlem Renaissance Wit Beer is light enough to drink with all the delicious food. Be careful not to get tricked into getting full on the godly cornbread. Be wary of trying it with butter, as it will be even better with it.

My go-to shall forever be the Ruby Dee. The Ruby Dee is fried or baked catfish (I usually go with fried) that is so good it makes your heart smile. Since it's a part of the Daily Entree menu, it comes with 2 sides. The Mac N Cheese and French fries are my favorite complement to it. Thankfully, most of the tables are equipped with hot sauce so you can just throw it right into your chicken or fish.

My photo may not do the portion sizes justice. Trust me, Amy Ruth's is very generous with their serving sizes. Arrive on an empty stomach to maximize on the delicious meal you will have.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I must be honest. I'm from DC and know how southern food should taste. This majorily disappointed me. I got the ribs, mac and cheese and yams. The ribs were SMOTHERED in BBQ sauce, where tasteless and the sides also lacked real flavor. I have a feeling that when they first opened the chef was banging, but now it's not as great. When I looked around, others also left food untouched. I actually had carryout two hours later because I didn't feel I ate enough. I felt terrible for wasting it, but I wouldn't have given it away, not when it was that bad. When it doesn't taste good, it doesn't taste good. Seasoning food is not that hard. This meal failed in so many ways. Food should be enjoyed and a great experience.

Now, my service: that was a 10/10. I felt welcomed coming through the doors. The server was excellent and my food came out with in a few seconds it seemed. The peach mimosa was really  just peach flavored Mystic (or whatever) and Cava. That was OK. The price was affordable.  The plate is big enough for two people. The location is a few feet away from 116th Street Station.

I wouldn't recommened Amy Ruth's to anyone looking for authentic southern soul food in NYC. Their food needs love and seasoning.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amy Ruth's,"This is really a third and half star review.

I had been here several years ago with my father and brother and loved everything about it.
I returned last night with my wife. She had never been to a soul food restaurant, so I was excited for her.
I couldn't remember what I ordered the last time, so I tried the pork chops...deep fried. That turned out to be a mistake. I should have gone smothered, but my inexperience bit me in the butt. The pork chops weren't very hot and it was really hard to eat. I usually like eat pork chops with a fork and knife. But I wound up eating with my hands. It turned out fine. What saved the meal for me, was the mashed potatoes. It was heavenly. Soft, milky and creamy. My other side order was collard greens. I think by the time I ate the other two items,the greens seemed overkill. I didn't eat much.

Though it seems like I didn't have a good time, I enjoyed it. The music was on point, mostly 80's R&B, and the service was pleasant.

My wife said she liked her meal...so it was a win-win.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"With 2000+ reviews, not sure Amy Ruth's in Harlem needs any more. But perhaps it helps to have another current one. Traveling here with family to work at CUNY's Advanced Science Research Center, I was looking for a good southern-style Breakfast. This place fits the bill. Served up a warm biscuit right away and fresh-brewed excellent coffee. I regret not having ordered the shrimp and eggs or the other fish dishes and eggs. I went with my standard eggs over-easy and grits. The food, atmosphere and service were all excellent.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Been here many times and they don't ever disappoint. Had dinner last night with a group (literally 20+) for my bf's fathers bday and the wait staff was very patient with us. Our waitress Merelyn did a great job with us regardless of our huge crowd. Drinks took a little while to come out but besides that it was fine. Wouldn't bother with dessert next time though.

EDIT:
This spot doesn't ever fail. Took a friend here last night and she loved it (first timer). The music is alwayssss on point!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"After the Kwanzaa Celebration show at the Apollo(truly thought provoking and very joyful performance!), we visited Amy Ruth's. One You Tube channel introduced that this restaurant is a must-visit in Harlem.

The foods were delicious. We ordered the Rev. Al Sharpton waffle and the President Barack Obama, and both were so good and came out with huge portion. Besides the famous fried chicken(yummy~~~), surprisingly pleasant parts were the waffles and side dishes(coleslaw and max&cheese). I loved them! - waffles were crispy and fluffy perfect combination and the coleslaw sauce is, wow, just amazing, a real bomb!

I was so happy to go to Amy Ruth's. Of course foods were amazing, but in addition to that, I loved the restaurant vibes - the music, paintings and people(customers included). People were very friendly and welcoming. When I asked about the figures of the mural paintings, people sitting next to us were so kindly telling us stories of them. I felt like I was getting to learn about the community, which is definitely the best part of traveling- mingling with the locals and learning the lively cultures through them. It was such an precious experience and we want to THANK YOU ALL :-)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,Mac and cheese was amazing so was the waffle. But that chicken was horrible. Almost tasted old like from the night before. Just because Of that I probably would never try this spot again. Don't use the moist towelettes they give either. Please work on that chicken. Wish I would of took a picture. You can get better chicken at the chicken spot on the corner,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Amy Ruth's never disappoints! I have tried two of their dishes (fried chicken with waffles, and the Michelle Obama - fried whiting) and they are out of this world! The waffles are just right - fluffy, not too heavy and not too ""airy"". The chicken and fries whiting are both seasoned well, not greasy and delicious. The sides that I have tried (Cole slaw and mashed potatoes) are also wonderful and are homemade. You can tell that Amy Ruth's puts great effort and detail into making good food. I highly recommend this place for anybody who is in the area.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"It was ooooooook

I remember coming here almost every month a while ago (8 years in the past) and I really enjoyed the place. Jump forward a few years and I found it to be just ok. With the influx of so many chicken and waffles joints in the city, Amy's should step up its game. However, I can totally understand ""if it aint broke, don't fix it"".

On the raining day we came, there was a 15 minute wait, outside of the restaurant, which is to be expected. However, I really did not understand the wait (we, a party of two, were second in line), and there were four empty tables in the restaurant.

Inside, I ordered steak and waffles. Since it was after 11 AM, I was a little disappointed that I could not order eggs. Oh well, rules are rules. The waffle was pretty decent, but I think there was some miscommunication regarding the steak. I asked for my steak to be medium, and it clearly was VERY well done.

Our waiter, Walter, was pretty much on top of things, so I cannot say anything too bad about the service. The one annoying thing that I noticed after leaving the restaurant is my clothes smelled like fried oil. I actually had to go home and shower before going back out. I get that it 99% of the menu items have a fried component, but it seems that the filtering system for the restaurant should be looked at.

All in all,  it is an ok place to visit once and a while, especially with out of town guests who want experience chicken and waffles.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I came for Sunday brunch with seven friends in tow. It looked as if we weren't going to be seated for a while. Surprisingly, the eight of us got seated in about 20 minutes which was a great start.

Amy Ruth's names a few of their dishes after noteworthy African Americans. I didn't recognize a few names. However, I do know who Gabrielle Union is: two large smothered pork chops with two sides (I chose mac and & cheese, candied yams).

Holy hell (I really wanted to curse here) these folks serve some amazing food. The pork chops were delicious and I savored every morsel. The gravy was hearty and seasoned nicely. The yams were balanced, sweet but not overpowering. The mac & cheese was off the hook. A soul food restaurant always has to get these sides right to be worthy of attention.

My only complaint was that one pork chop was a lot more tender than the second one. Maybe they were different cuts? Confusing, but both were tasty. This was a TON of food...I didn't eat for the rest of the day. The service and space are a bit no frills, but they get the job done. Very good soul food offered here.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"We came here on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. The staff was super friendly, especially Natasha who kept us laughing with her outgoing and sweet personality. I had the Fried President Barack Obama with the Mac and Cheese and Steamed White Rice. The chicken was perfectly cooked and it was so fresh and juicy. The Mac and cheese was super cheesy and delicious as well. I also tried out The Sunrise which is a mixture of fruit punch, lemonade and orange juice I believe. It was to die for! Probably the best soul food I've ever had!! Definitely will be coming again! Thank you, Natasha!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Our group of 7 came on a Sunday around 1130AM and waited about 20 minutes before being seated.

Biscuits come piping hot. It tastes dry and mushy at the same time.

Chicken and waffle smothered is with gravy, which I'm a huge fan of. The gravy here was excellent and really made this chicken and waffle taste special. Adding syrup and butter made it taste amazing albeit high in regret.

Waffle is fresh and fluffy and a must with the chicken. Helps balance out the intensity of the chicken.

The food took awhile to come out, but tasted so fresh when it finally did. Totally worth the wait! Everyone ordered different styles of chicken and ribs and they were all satisfied. This place really reminds of a typical joint in the south.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I came here on vacation, because I heard it was the best in Harlem ,so I had to give it a try! Overall it was good, I had the catfish meal with two sides. Greens and Mac and cheese which was really good. Everything was great I just wish my fish was crispier. Other than that it was good",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"As an avid fried chicken fan, I was quite excited to visit Amy Ruth's! The line outside the establishment only proved to me how popular the food here is, and only increased my enthusiasm. But for people who can't handle a little wait time, I would recommend coming earlier or during an off hour. The spot is very large though, so I don't expect people to be in line too long.

The menu consists of entrees and waffle meals. From what I've seen, the entree dishes seem like more bang for your buck, as the missing waffle is replaced with a very large portion of the entree meal, but for those of you who are waffle enthusiasts I wouldn't recommend skipping the waffle as it was very fluffy and delicious.

The Rev. Al Sharpton: this seems to be the classic fried chicken and waffle combo, which comes with one waffle and one thigh and leg attached together. The waffle was definitely one of the best fluffy waffles I've had, and the chicken was quite tender and juicy, with not too much batter. I was hoping for a little more chicken but overall it was a good amount of food.

The Reggie Harris: definitely worth a try. The honey used in the sauce was rich in a way that was very organic and almost savory, and tasted like very high quality honey. We got the green beans and Mac and cheese, and I personally liked the okra the most amongst the side dishes I tried.

I also tried the Kool-aid of the day, which was grape. Very sweet! I wasn't able to finish it but it was a good change in taste from the more savory fried chicken. Next time, I would try the fisherman's platter or the rib and chicken combo which was piled very high with meat.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

I thought that the food was alright. It wasn't amazing or mind-blowing, but it's a spot I'll come back to, whenever I'm in Harlem. I ordered their ribs and chicken combo, which comes with two sides. It's pretty expensive for the amount of meat they give for the chicken.
Their cornbread is good, but it fell apart so quick. The rib sauce is amazing, but the meat was really hard. Their Mac n cheese might be the best thing there because it was on point. Lastly, the collard greens were just alright.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amy Ruth's,"Substantial, delicious dishes that will fill up your heart and your stomach!! My friend's boyfriend recommended us this place as having great breakfast near CUMC and I could not agree more.

We were the first to arrive when they opened their doors (my friend had a flight to catch and I had class to go to) and our server Jamie was so kind. He's very friendly and welcoming!

We wanted to share some of the entrees but unfortunately it was too soon as they only had breakfast and waffle options available. Nevertheless, I ordered the fried chicken with 2 eggs sunny side up and grits while my friend had her fried chicken with a waffle.

The dark meat fried chicken was massive, very crispy, and perfectly seasoned. It didn't have any of the excess batter on it so I'm not sure what the secret was but it reminds me of my favorite fried chicken place back in Thailand. The eggs were well cooked and the grits were just okay (I'm not a big fan of grits in general). My friend's waffle was very well done. It wasn't crispy but it was very filling and chewy and had a nice sweet, yet savory flavor to it (prob from the fried chicken juices). You do have the option to smother your fried chicken but we opted to get it on the side so the chicken would still stay crispy! Ooh and the complimentary biscuits/cornbread? came out piping hot and buttery! I just ate them by themselves and really enjoyed the flavor.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

Normally when that happens the quality of the place tends to go down but somehow the food at Amy Ruth's is still pretty great. If you want to avoid the crazy lines here you should come during the week or after midnight. This is one of the few places in the neighborhood that is open late in the morning, I came in after 3am and didn't have to wait. The decor of this place is very simple, murals of famous people and a somewhat rundown cafeteria feel. It's clear that the focus here is on the food and not the ambiance. I've been here a few times and always ordered the fried or smothered chicken, the chicken here is well seasoned, crispy and delicious. The mac and cheese taste homemade, collard greens are good and if you're into cornbread that's also really good here.

I'm saying it --- Amy Ruth's takes the cake over Roscoe's any day. I might be sinning against L.A., but I can always repent.

The entire vibe of the joint was like a 2000's Hits club mixed with the energy of a weekend Waffle House, but 1000 times better!

Fitzroy made me feel at home in Harlem, and I was really pleased when he gave my girlfriend mac and cheese on the house since it was our first time there.

Okay - the waffles --- they were airy, and weren't too doughy. Loved every single bite. The chicken, really tender, and didn't even need more than a few drops of hot sauce.

On the real, the chicken/waffle plate, mac and cheese, and cornbread were cleaned up in no more than FIFTEEN minutes.

I've had Amy Ruth's ages ago when I was in college but I was hungover so I don't really recall the experience. However, I came back recently one evening with a homeboy of mine just to catch up and it was the best decision we made! There wasn't a long wait and we were able to order within 5-10 minutes of being there. (Could've been sooner had it not been for my friend taking a million years to decide between breakfast food or dinner). I ordered the Ruby Dee, which was the fried catfish. I ordered it with a side of steamed okra and potato salad. My friend had the strawberry waffles with a side of French Fries. The food came out sizzling hot and being who I am, I got right up in that and ended up burning my tongue slightly, but it was well worth it. The catfish's batter was perfectly golden and salted. The potato salad had just enough relish and mayo. The okra was as buttery as a bodega's butter bagel. I was in foodie heaven! My homeboy couldn't fight the urge to have some of my food so I played nice and shared my plate. Amy Ruth's didn't disappoint the soul food itch I had that night.

Amy Ruth's,"""I can take you to Amy Ruth's, that's Harlem Swag. Get you some of the best soul food you've ever had."" - Jae Millz

I was excited when I found out my family had dinner plans at the infamous Amy Ruth's. I love me some soul food.  This place was pretty popular with a half an hour wait time, but there was a shop around the corner having a blowout clearance sale, so that time was easily killed.

The meal I had was pretty solid. I got ""The Reggie Harris"" honey dipped chicken with macaroni & cheese, and collard greens. The chicken I had was hot and juicy and the sweetness of the honey was nice. The collards were okay, but the star of my meal was the macaroni & cheese. Whew that stuff was hitting! I wish I had ordered a whole pan of it. Probably the best I've had from any restaurant. The only people who make it better are my mother and my late grandmother. The cornbread was trash tho. It tasted like straight jiffy mix and water with no type of sweetness to it, but it was complimentary so I can let that go.

Overall, I'm going to have to disagree with my man's Jae Millz from YMCMB about Amy Ruth's being the best soul food I ever had, but I was pretty pleased with my food.  I have to try this place again when I'm rolling through Harlem and try something different.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"The wait - very long and always crowded but smaller groups can get in relatively quick...i'd plan on 2-3 people and 45 mins.

The service - very friendly, knowledgeable and quick!

The food....

Fried chicken was amazing! I'd say one of the best in NYC and worth the trek up west to get it.

Waffles were so good! They're not like your traditional waffles, a little more airy but perfect chewiness. BEST with syrup.

Biscuit was the the only downside. it tastes quite bitter - looks like they use a lot of baking powder to create these? First time, thought it was maybe a mistake or something on the dishes but our second time, same.

Sides were ok, we went with the basic corn and mash potatoes although we did get an extra bowl of gravy :)",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Such an amazing place! The food may not be pretty but it is so good! The chicken was super juicy, the complimentary cornbread was flaky and buttery. They may and cheese is thick and delicious, the cheesy grits could use a bit more cheese but were also delicious! The vibe is super chill, nothing fancy, cafeteria-style tables, with cool artwork on the walls and mirrors. The staff was super friendly and the food came out quickly, but not too quickly! Honestly, this place is a keeper and I will definitely be back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Went here for lunch, service was very fast. But the Mac and cheese was salty and the collard greens wasn't all the way cook (they were crunchy). Yams were very good though.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I absolutely LOVEEEEE this place. They have the best waffles, chicken and Mac & Cheese I've ever had. The service is great- food comes very fast. And in the mean time you get some of the best homemade corn bread!

Everyone here is always in a good mood. The wait to get in can be lengthy at times depending on the day but it is worth it! I would eat Amy Ruth's everyday if I lived closer.

Truly resembles amazing soul food and old school Harlem.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I really enjoyed my visit to Amy Ruth's. Service is pretty fast, and food is well prepared. The ribs were juicy, tender and tasty. I would definitely order again. Thanks, Amy Ruth!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I ordered the al sharpton which was chicken and waffles smothered, we also ordered shrimp and grits, Mac and cheese burger and a whole bunch of sides like collard greens, fried okra, Mac and cheese and cabbage. My husband thought it was just ok. Actually so did my son. They were annoyed that they wasted precious stomach space on food they felt was mediocre. They like Popeyes better. I liked the cornbread and the beans and rice.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"When you see a line of people outside a restaurant...that is a very good sign..and so is the case here.

I have never had a bad meal from Amy Ruth's.  I am tired of ordering mac & cheese from other restaurants that are skimpy on the ingredients, but at Amy Ruth's it's just like homemade full of cheese and everything you would want a mac and cheese to taste like.  

The last time I was there, I bought smothered turkey wings...oh my so delish.  And the 2 huge fried pork chops won't disappoint.

P.S. the peach cobbler is also a must have and they give you too much to finish at one time.  You will def need bigger pants :)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Yooo
The food is soooo good. I'm not sure how I'm gonna eat soul food anywhere else. I came here late after performing at a comedy show (follow me @bigkevcomedy) looking for some fried chicken and Mac/Cheese and Candied yams. It wasn't too crowded, but I wasn't planning on staying. It was a short wait for food. Once I put my teeth in my mouth started watering, and I had a little bit of slobber. Food was well cooked, flavorful.
This food is so good, you won't share with no one.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,This place I known for good chicken and unique flavor .... but my advise to any LOCAL and TOURIST. Do not go on a Friday or weekend. SERVICE IS HORRIBLE. My waitress seemed to be under pressure by normal rush hour... she messed up the order in two dishes and didn't check us after serving food. Bottom line when it comes down to a good experience service is vital. Our experience was not as expected.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"This is supposed to be the great soul food restaurant in NYC, and it's certainly convenient to get to even if you're not otherwise going anywhere near Harlem, being half a block outside a major station on the 2-3 subway line.  It was bright and friendly (with wall mural portraits of famous people like Michael Jackson and Bill Cosby, sigh), and the service was real good.

It was the food which was not so much.  I ate here twice, once for the bbq chicken which is the specialty, or so my guidebook said.  You get light or dark meat, your choice, and the serving is slightly more than a quarter chicken; it's a little hard to tell, since the meat is kind of mixed up in itself.  Still, it's more chewy than it is tender, though the sauce is good.

The other time I had a mixed fried seafood platter.  The crab cake was OK, the shrimp not bad, but the catfish was absolutely terrible: rubbery and tasteless.  I immediately canceled any plans I'd had to come back for breakfast and have catfish and eggs.

Meals come with two sides from a fairly long list.  The greens (collard greens, string beans) are not very good.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Fun place, great people! The food is great and the atmosphere is exciting. I tried the catfish and waffles. It was good, not amazing but good. Best catfish is still New Orleans take out in Madison, WI.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Service is phenomenal. Food is delicious and filling. I probably should have shared one meal because the waffle was so filling that I only ate half. The waffle is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, chicken is fried perfectly and juicy. I have absolutely no complaints! I came with 2 friends who also mirrored both thoughts.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Amazing soul food! I got the fried chicken platter with sides of Mac and cheese and fried okra. The chicken was fried with an even coat of batter, which I appreciated (I'm not an extra crispy kinda gal, too bready). The Mac and cheese was so good, it was so hard to stop eating it (not joking, I had to get a to go box to control myself). And the okra was good, I hadn't had okra in a long ass time. I will say, I took a bite of my friend's collards and wish I got that instead. They were on par with how my grandmother made them (and trust me, hers were incredible). Another bonus: a basket of cornbread to start!

Would recommend if you're in the area and brought and appetite... I felt like keeling over afterward and still had enough leftovers for a second meal.

Fun tip: there are murals of black excellence all over the walls where we sat (Obama, MJ, etc) so you'll be in good company.

Fun tip #2: the bathroom is NOT single stall. I thought it was and waited for a minute or so and was embarrassed when someone opened the door to reveal 2 toilets. Lol.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"This place is on fleek! We came for our annual girlfriend trip. My nephew Tory recommenced Amy Ruth. The portions are high and you will definitely take a to go box with you! The food is well seasoned and tastes like home cooked food from your childhood. There is a line and Someone is at the door to take your name; the line goes real quick. They have upstairs seating & and you will be seated quickly. The staff is attentive and didn't have to ask for water refills; waitress came by to ask about our food, no complaints. Turkey wings meat falls off the bones; catfish is flavorful and fried chicken is awesome. The green beans are my favorite and the potato salad delicious  along with the cabbage. This is a keeper",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"This may or may not be my all time favorite restaurant in all of NYC and is worth whatever it takes to get there.

It's in the heart of Harlem, and has all the vibes inside. It has a cafe feel, very casual, and amazing murals of black icons all over the walls. You feel the soul permeating from the walls. The employees are all family and likely all related to Amy and its just a feeling that warms your soul.

The best choice I made was to get the half lemonade half ice tea which was the best drink I have ever had in my life. I still have dreams about it.

If you get anything besides the chicken and waffles, that is a mistake. Hands down, best fried chicken I have ever had, but also all around one of the best meals I have ever had. The mac n cheese was okay but nothing special, same with the cornbread (that comes free), but thats okay because you want to save all your room for the meal.

Amy knows how to give everyone a little soul.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Absolutely amazing! Came by here on a work trip to NYC. There was a group of us - we had to wait for everyone to arrive to get seated, but they gave us a table to sit inside while we waiting since it was so cold.

Food was amazing. I shared the honey-drizzled fried chicken and fried fish with a friend. Both were perfectly fried, crispy outside but still moist inside. Everyone was really happy with their food. A few of the sides were slightly underwhelming - particularly the veggie once that could have been more seasoned.

Great for groups - wonderful vibe and prompt, thoughtful service.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,I was dying to try this place for so long. I have ate here twice and both time I used the bathroom after idk what it is but they good is amazing. I usual get the gravy smothered chicken and waffles it is so good I can't try nothing new. But third time back I will try something different.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,BOMB.com. This place was so good. We had a party of 10 on a Saturday evening. They don't take reservations but sat us in about 15 to 20 mins of arrival. Food came quickly and everyone was happy. Side note: fried shrimp you only get 6. We had everything from chicken and waffles to salmon patties. And they give you corn bread...hot out the oven. Make sure you try the kool aid of the day. Lol..enjoy.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,A true gem. Featuring real southern soul food while at the same time paying homage to the Harlem impact on modern music and art.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Probably the best fried chicken and waffles in the city. Service is prompt, food is fresh, atmosphere is neat, we loved the wall art. It used to be Harlem's best kept secret, but with all the change going on in the area, it's popularity has risen and that's not a bad thing because I want Amy Ruth's around for along time!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"This is my second time coming to Amy Ruth's, again not impressed. I wanted to give them another try because I've heard good things about the restaurant. Bad decision. I ordered the ludacris with Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The mac and cheese is really nasty. It almost has a sweet flavor to it, no Mac and cheese should be sweet. I couldn't get past that flavor. The fried chicken had no flavor what's so ever, a bit overcooked. The mashed potatoes may be the only thing I ate on the plate. It was the only thing that tasted good. Besides the food, the service was not great either, I believe the waitress had too many tables to attend to. But it made the experience 10 times worse. We were seated next to the window, right in the front of the restaurant and there were about 20 flies in that window. It was disgusting. They were flying around while we were eating. I saw a customer at another table swatting away flies also. It was really a turn off, I will not be returning.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Food was delicious - had the fried chicken, collard greens, to die for candy yams, steamed okra, Mac n cheese and banana pudding for dessert!

The service was amazing. We had a super friendly server who was very attentive.

Came here for a date and had a great time! If you haven't been here before, highly recommend it!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Very disappointed with this location. They weren't fighting it's customers. Had I notice it sooner I would have left.

This is a place where food is prepared beforehand and then presented to you quickly unfortunately that means that the food has been sitting for hours cuz and it's anybody's guess if it will be prepared properly. For example I got smothered pork chops presentation wise that looks great.

And when I fit into the first pork chop it was okay. But the second pork chops have been sitting in there Baker for hours on end and that's results Not only was it try was overcooked and you couldn't even cut into it. Very disappointing.

We're not quite sure what the jerk chicken was but it wasn't jerk chicken. Buyers beware before going here!!",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,The food at any Ruth's is amazing and the staff and service was exceptional. I had the Ludacris and the Gabriel union with waffles and shrimp and I was satisfied with everything. The only down side is the place is alittle dated with the furniture but the music makes you forget about that... I will definitely be returning on future outings .,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"If you like Southern Homestyle food, lots of fried stuff, this is your spot. Came here with coworkers that, when we travel, like to find a Soul Food neighborhood haunt, and this was perfect. Loved the service, lots of people checking on us to make sure we were good. I ordered the Al Sharpton and loved every bit of the fried chicken and the waffle. We also ordered an order of wings to share and they were great!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Had lunch at Amy Ruth's, even though it is located quite far from the town but it is worth to come. We ordered bbq pork rib and chicken combo, they were served with 2 side dishes, the portion was so big and the bbq source was so good, a bit sweet but good. Anoth Merry er friend of mine ordered waffle with chicken, he said the waffle was good and chicken was well-cooked and crispy.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"This is one of my absolute favorite places in NYC. And even though I have some critics to make, I think is awesome.  The wait although not long (15 min) is outside in the blistering cold. Nothing to heat those waiting to be seated and Amy Ruth's doesn't take reservations over the phone.  The host was an old mean dude that needs to have some manners.  The wait didn't seemed justified since there were tables but then I noticed that there was only one cook in the front kitchen . Still, the food came amazing, fresh, hot and nicely presented.  The server was lovely. So YES! go to Amy Ruth's the best  chicken and waffles  !!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"The long line is worth the wait. The service is worth the wait, the food is delicious. My boys get chicken and waffles every time.

They have amazing sides, great tea, and an incredible history. Lots of places aren't worth the hype. Amy Ruth's is.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I don't understand why this Mac & Cheese cost $8 - see picture.

Seems like a clear rip off - I should have asked what the size looks like.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Believe all of the positive things you hear about this place! The wait might get long but it's worth it when you get inside.

I ordered the Catfish and Waffles...and it was slammin'. It was seasoned well and crispy in the ""just right"" amount. You could tell how good the food was because our talkative table became very quiet when we're eating :) so good overall!

Bonus Review (about their staff):
The staff is very friendly and very accommodating. My friend had a question about one of the side dishes, and our server brought out a little sampler for her to try. We weren't expecting that (and I don't think you should either lol). But we were pleasantly surprised at how she went out of her way to accommodate my friend.

The man at the door was also very nice. There was a bit of a wait when we got there but he was very pleasant, friendly and made sure we were taken care of.

We had a great time. We'd go again!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Okay friends,
It's been a minute since I posted a review but I just simply had to. This is my first time in Harlem's Amy Ruth's.

The place is much bigger than it looks. I rolled up with a buddy at about 11am on Sunday. Took us about five minutes to be seated. In the section we are placed, the walls are painted with prominent black community leaders/figures of the last 100 years. From Rosa Parks to Shaq to Beyoncé and so on. I think it creates a nice understanding of the love and pride in black culture that this restaurant embodies.

*I don't give scores based off anything but the food really. The food is why I come and I like to keep it like that. That being said, the service could be a bit better. Still waiting on coffee and more water even though I asked a couple times. They are busy but it's not crazy in here. Everyone is super nice though, so if you remain a little persistent, patient, and nice then you'll be fine!

The food:
Free Biscuits: They are hot and fresh, a little on the dry side and not my favorite flavor but they are free so who care. Throw some butter on and jam and deal with it!

Chicken and waffles - this is my first time have this dish and it was wonderful. Waffle was soft but firm and chewy and the fried chicken was a delight. Crispy skin with great flavor, the inside was buttery and juicy. Perfect for having some syrup on top! Individual score: 8.6/10

Spare ribs: it's a shame I got the spare ribs because if I would've just got the chicken and waffles I might've given this place a 5 star rating, but that was not the case.
I'm from Houston and I'm not sure how ribs are done up here but anything that needs to be smothered in so much BBQ sauce is just not gonna do it for me. They are well cooked and really fall off the bone, but I just don't get it with the sauce. Too sweet. Too much. Individual score: 6.7/10
Mac and cheese: Solid but not creamy, it's more like a casserole. Individual score 7.9/10
Collard Greens: the collards were actually really really good. It's doesn't look like they are gonna have a bunch of flavor but they were for sure the best of the rib plate! Individual score 9.1/10.

Final Thoughts: Okay all in all it's a solid place. If you get the fried chicken you are gonna be golden (no pun intended). Not sure about the pork chop or anything else but I guess it's worth a shot. I'll leave the rest of the food up to you, but this is my take!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I am an international student who has been in NYC for three years but got my first fried chicken and waffle today here. I am fan of food and culture so I was wondering what the taste would be -- heavenly. They will give you a warm cornbread which is just perfect -- soft and well flavored which goes perfect itself or with butter. I ordered the classic fried chicken (leg&breast) and waffle and it was perfect choice. Crispy and well-salted chicken (which was really melting) and fluffy waffles, made me wonder why didn't I visit this place long ago.

Would come back for sure, and I am thinking of the fried chicken and waffle for all day long!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I've been to Amy Ruth's three times and every single experience was just what I needed. On my first visit I had the pork spareribs with a side of mac and cheese and collard greens with a sweet tea. i felt the mac and cheese was dry, the other items were very tasty.

My second trip I had the Ludacris which is chicken wings and your choice of sides. I had potato salad and green beans again with sweet tea. OMG the potato salad is on point as were the green beans.

My third trip I had the Ludacris again with potato salad and collard greens with sweet tea.

Side note - the use sugar in pretty much everything so be sure to have water with your meal.

Amy Ruth's is definitely on my regular eatery list.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"OMG!!!! Where to begin!!!!

My homegirl and I decided to come here for lunch here on day while in the city. I didn't think I had been there before until I sat down and then I realized I had been one other time years ago.. Anyway let me just say the food here is AMAZING!!!

Ambience:
This place is nothing special, however you feel at home when you are here. It looks small when you first walk in so you don't think they hav a lot of seating, but what I didn't realize is they have seating in a room on the side and in the back you just cant see it when you walk in. It does get crowded on the weekends especially around noon, so get there before 1p if you don't wan to wait. You can also get there earlier if you are an early riser. Found out they also stay open late on Fri and Sat, which is cool. I also like the fact that it has murals of MJ And Whitney on the wall and the menu also has all types of famous people who have visited like presidents, celebs, athletes etc.

Service:
Our server was Natasha and she was FANTASTIC. She was honest, funny an sarcastic, I just loved her and you could tell she loved her job. It was funny b/c I was being a bit picky I guess and she kept messing with me about it and every time she passed by I seemed to needed something, to the point where if she walked away and I forgot to ask her for something else I would get up so I wouldn't have to try and get her attention and she would look at me like what you need now, but in a funny way. We laughed and joked with her during our time there. She was just amazing, and although she joked to my friend and told her never to bring me back I told her next time I come in I am gonna make sure to ask for her....lol

Food:
Well this is a soul food type of place, so if you like soul food you will LOVE this place. i like they fact that some of the names of the entree's are names after celebs and I guess what their favorite meal is there. I had the turkey wing and let me tell you they were huge and so tender. I had it with a side of fried okra and mac-n-cheese. My friend had shrimp an grits with a side of mac-n-cheese and collards, and the meals came with cornbread. The food was just delicious!. I couldn't eat it all and had to take some home. I did taste my friend's shrimp and grits and collards, let me just say those collards were on point, as for the shrimp and grits they weren't as tasty as they looked. I am a southern girl so I am picky about my grits. They do have to be seasoned well, and these were a bit bland and the shrimp also could have been seasoned better. I almost ordered this dish, but am so glad I didn't and she did so I could taste it. Now I know not to order them. But it did look amazingly good, the taste just didn't live up to the expectation.  I also ordered a to go of banana pudding!! OH MY WORD it was soooooooo good!! I was gonna order the peach cobbler b/c it is my fave, but after speaking to Natasha about which to get she said their banana was better, and boy was she right. She actually let us taste a bit of each before I made my decision, which was so nice of her. I had some much of the pudding that I ate on it for  about 3 days... They do you give lots of food for your money!

All in all I HIGHLY recommend you try this place if you are in Harlem, even if you're not make the trip it is so worth it ! promise! And ask for Natasha's section.. Tell I sent you ..lol",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Super delicious soul food!! I've come to this location multiple times, I've tried the fried catfish and the fried chicken, both were amazing, just the right amount of crisp and seasoning. The cornbread melts in your mouth and can be a little addictive, causing you to eat too much before your meal and feel stuffed... Lol, don't ruin your meal!!! The collard greens are divine, nice and spicy, not over cooked and I love the baked Mac and cheese, although the last time I went, they seemed super sweet, which was a different after taste for me from them.

The location is pretty much always packed so be prepared to wait, especially if you have a party that is larger than 3 people. The wait staff are pretty attentive and the food service is fairly quick for the amount of people that they are serving. I would definitely go here again.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,While the food is good the service is horrible. Long lines always. I placed a seamless order for pickup and when I arrived they couldn't find my order. After much debate they canceled my order because they couldn't fulfill it. They need better management to handle the massive crowds they get every week.,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Amy Ruth's was one of the most enjoyable meals I had in NY.  We ordered the Reggie Harris, which was fried chicken with honey, alongside some sides of mac and cheese and candied yams.  The chicken was really crispy and the inside was really juicy - the honey definitely added a great flavor to the chicken, and I wish I had more.  The mac and cheese was also pretty good and rich.  The candied yams were good, but I personally couldn't eat too much of it since it was so sweet.  

Overall, the meal was delicious, and the portion sizes were solid.  The price might seem a bit steep at first, but I thought it was worth it.  The service was also solid, and we were seated the moment we stepped in during early dinner time.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Casual establishment offering Southern comfort food classics while paying homage to the black community through its menu, wall photos, and hip-hop music blasting. Was seated right away late on a weeknight and our waiter, Fitz, was sweet and friendly. Got so many things ah!

Complimentary cornbread - so flaky and warm.

Red zinga tea and mint tea - delicious, hot water was refilled once.

Salmon entree - huge filet, gonna guess about 8 ounces, comes with peach butter, but was cooked perfectly and didn't even need it, so was thankful that it came on the side.

Chicken liver - Wednesday special. A bit mushier than I'm used to when it comes to liver, but I still liked it, but not a standout.

Sides in order of how much I liked: steamed okra, black eyed peas, mashed potatoes, rice - definitely get the first two!

Banana pudding - Lord have mercy.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"My 500th Yelp review and last review of 2017 goes to Amy Ruth's!!

Its been a long time coming and I am glad our paths finally crossed. I saw the long line outside and was discouraged from waiting outside in the frigid cold. So we went shopping at Fallas- down the block to wait out the long line. It was a good plan.

When we returned the line was gone and then we went inside to put our names on the list. This place is huge, after Sharon- the hostess told us to take a seat in the catering hall next door on a cold afternoon.  After defrosting, we were surprised at how fast we were called- after less than 10 mins of waiting. Upon entry, we were taken upstairs and passed a number of other dining areas on the way. I had no idea Amy Ruth's was this big.

Marilyn was our server and she was very pleasant, efficient, and gave us great recommendations. The bus boys were on point. The restaurant definitely ran like a smooth assembly line.

For starters, they gave us a complimentary basket of cornbread.- Good start! Luckily we did not have to wait that long for our food to arrive and while waiting I took notice of the murals of historic black figures on the walls.

We ordered The Reggie Harris- Southern fried honey dipped chicken entree which came with two sides. For sides, we chose macaroni & cheese and the red beans and rice. The glazed chicken was the sure winner. If you have had Dallas BBQ's sticky wings then this tastes similar but better. The mac and cheese and rice were ok but I have had better.

We also ordered the Rev. Al Sharpton - Fried chicken and waffle that didn't come with a side but ordered the side of fried okra ( not pictured) as an extra side. The fried chicken was delish! Finger licking good, but I controlled myself. The flavor of the waffle was really good-like they put their foot in it. The fried okra was ok.

For dessert we had the Rum cake ( not pictured) which was a nice finale!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Service was amazing from start to finish, we were immediately seated and our food came out super quick. The only only reason I put 4 stars and not 5 is bc the sides were not hot enough when they came out and the taste of the were pretty good but I had better. Overall it was still amazing. This chicken is undefeated for sure",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Best southern food in nyc! As a southern belle in the city, I muuuuch prefer the recipes here than Sylvia's by far. The fried catfish, yams, greens, cabbage, and Mac and cheese are my faves. They serve sweet cakelike cornbread while you wait. The restaurant is no longer black owned but the Jewish owner has maintained an all colored staff. I have no complaints. Oh! The guy who manages the waitlist often over estimates the wait, so if he says 45 min wait, don't leave, you could be called in 15. ;-)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"My oh my what a restaurant! This place is the ultimate southern cooking experience. I'm from the south, so when I moved to NYC I was really homesick for a hearty, home cooked meal. Amy Ruth's is close to my apartment, so one day I took my roommate there. Immediately the atmosphere was really chill and family-oriented. We were given cornbread as a free appetizer to go with our sweet tea (a rare find in the north). Our meal was so massive that we had to take half of it to go! The prices were fair and the menu was vast. I was in a food coma for the rest of the night, but it was completely worth it. I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for a true southern meal.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Visiting Harlem from Houston Texas!  Family recommended this place. All I can say is OH MY! This smothered chicken reminds me of my momma's cooking! Got a little teary!  Definitely of my clean eating plan, but well worth the culinary experience. Hubby let me taste his honey fired chicken.  So good.  Its worth the trip. Hubby had the koolaid, thats were i draw the limit. No sugar!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,Was hyped from the reviews but when I actually went is was a different experience. I ordered the smothered turkey wing. My food cold as hell! No flavor .. the gravy was cold and the color was pale just looked inedible! On top of that it was noisy! Too noisy for a restaurant! I sent the food back and left. I tried it! Will not be back,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"This is a nice eating spot that I love to take family, friends that live out of state or abroad. I first learned about and visited Amy Ruth's in high school and that was almost twenty years ago! It's good to know that they are still going strong! Last, I took my family from London and they completely enjoyed the food! The soul food here is thorough through and through. I will always be a fan : ) The soul food here is thorough through and through. Love that they have vegan options too.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,I ordered and confirmed my order. I received fried chicken instead of whiting. I came from far east Long Island. The Mac & cheese was eeh! Collard greens and ribs were the best thing. The corn bread was dry and haD too much nutmeg or something it had a spice or something in it. The peach cobbler was not edible too much of something. The adults in my home wouldn't even eat the dishes. Never again!,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Searching for some good food in Harlem and came across this gem. I had the catfish, collards and Mac and cheese and everything was delicious. The portions were in excess and I'm glad my girlfriend and I decided to share an entree. The food seem to take longer than other guest that we're waiting but it was definitely worth the wait.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I had the toughest pork chops and collard greens, crunchiest steamed white rice and a waitress that absolutely did the restaurant a disservice because she didn't eat any of the food. And the gravy had way too much sage. My food was disappointing nonetheless. I sent the rice back & she insisted I get something else because I had to pay for it anyway.

This was my second time here, and the second time I've been disappointed. There won't be a third.

One good thing is the uptown was excellent!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,I'm a fried chicken aficionado.  I've had it all over the world and I was very excited to go here as it's has acclaim across the USA.  Firstly the staff is beyond wonderful.  Courteous and friendly.  Service was quick and they are quick to accommodate   The issue is the food. The corn bread was ok but not moist at all.  I was astounded when my order of chicken arrived in 3 minutes. Now I know it takes at least 12 to 15 minutes to fry chicken properly.  This leads to say that they are deep frying or worse keeping already cooked chicken under heat lamps.  The meat was very dry.  While the skin was cooked and seasoned well the dryness was so bad I couldn't finish my order. I hope they try to improve this as the staff deserves it,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Came here at 1030 on a weekday and we were almost worried the place wasn't open due to the holiday season. Luckily it was open and we were able to skip the long lines that were reported on previous reviews. Unfortunately, we couldn't order from the extra entree menu, since it wasn't available until 1130, but at least the chicken and waffles were available.

Ordered two reverend sharptons (1 smothered and 1 fried). I highly recommend that you get the fried. The smothered is pretty much the fried chicken, but it's immersed in gravy. I would prefer, if you were to order the smothered, to have the gravy on the side, because having the chicken covered with gravy makes the skin lose all the crispy goodness out of it. But the chicken and waffles are phenomenal. I'm from the west coast so the standard is Roscoes, but this place has some awesome chicken and waffles (roscoes doesn't do too great with having awesome chicken).

We also ordered the cheese and grits, which was okay. I'm not a big fan of grits and we originally wanted to order the Mac and cheese (because of all the great reviews), but it wasn't available until lunch time.

Overall, it's definitely a must try if you're in NY. Portions are pretty large, so I would recommend just sharing with a significant other if you're coming as a couple. I had an entire reverend sharpton, by myself, and I felt like I was having a heart attack and gout attack after finishing the meal. But it was absolutely delicious. Definitely coming back when I get the chance.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I was so excited to try this place since I had heard about it from some friends. Completely disappointed by the atrocious service.

We were seated for about ten minutes before anyone came by to drop off a basket of bread. No utensils, no plates. Another fifteen minutes passed before I finally flagged down a waitress to take our order. We had about four different servers pass by us, and although we were clearly ready to order (we'd been waiting so long that we were raising our hands, making eye contact, everything JUST to get our server to look at us), they simply walked by. Mind you, it wasn't very busy and our waitress clearly had better things to do, chatting to the other servers.

I told her that we had been waiting for someone to take our order, and that we hadn't received any silverware or plates. She goes to the back, brings out the plates, and slams them down at our table. I honestly could not believe how rude someone could be after making us wait a good thirty minutes just to request some fork and knives. She barks ""What do you want?"" and takes our order, clearly set on worsening the already not-great dining experience.

We ordered two waffle dishes. I ordered the Al Sharpton, which comes with either your choice of a fried chicken thigh + wing or breasted wing ($17). My friend ordered The Guy Woods & Shay Barnett, a waffle with banana and pecans ($14). The waffles were fluffy and soft, though portions leaned on the small side. The fried chicken on my waffle was so dry, I had to douse it with an ungodly amount of hot sauce in order to inject any flavor and moisture into it. For a soul food restaurant, this is unacceptable.

After we were done, a busboy came to take our plates. We waited another ten minutes for someone to take our check. At this point, we were just looking to leave because we had spent more time waiting than actually enjoying our food.

Amy Ruth's, the hopes were high here, but we were left sorely disappointed. There are plenty of other great soul food establishments in the area, so be aware that you don't have to settle for subpar service.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"This is one that best places to eat in Harlem. I highly recommend eating the President Obama special which BBQ chicken or smother. The flavors of there chicken and waffle are simply amazing as well. Outstanding customer service overall .

I'm sure this place can probably get crowded but i went around lunch time mid afternoon. we were seated right away, staff and waiter was very friendly to us and the food came out very quick (again it wasn't busy so probably why it did) I ordered The Reggie Harris with collard greens and candies yams. The good was honestly soo good the chicken was so juicy especially to be white meat. The collard greens and yams were perfect. They do serve cornbread before your meal comes out while your waiting , not a fan of cornbread but i did try theirs and i didn't like it seemed a little dry but other than that everything was just right",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,Nothing but good things to say about this famous Harlem eatery.

The fried shrimp is delicious.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I've been coming here since I moved to Harlem from the west coast 15 years ago, and it's still my fave for soul food in the neighborhood. Always fresh and delicious! I do wish they had more consistent delivery options (I see them occasionally pop up in different apps). Luckily they are close enough to home to dine in or take out.

Amy Ruth's,"Since, we were in Harlem last night we had to stop in and have our favorite soul food, at our favorite soul food place.

What do you need to know? It's about soul food here!!! I have frequented Amy Ruth's, for nearly 2 decades. I always get the same thing, the  Rev. Al Sharpton, which is simply the best chicken and waffle combo ever. The waffles are light with a tiny bit of crunch texture. I always opt for white meat. This is the winner, winner, always chicken dinner.
I also get the Kool-Aid of the day. None of this is healthy so, you might as well use this as a super cheat meal. You will get all the calories for the month at once.
You must get a side of the delicious baked mac & cheese. The potato salad is also very good but I did not get any this time around.
You also receive complementary corn bread that is just so good. Crumbly and not overly sweet just perfect.

They also have a really good, real deal southern red velvet cake.
Overall, may need to run a few laps after your meal but it is totally worth it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Huge portions!

Boyfriend and I stopped by while in the neighborhood, around 10 AM, and we were seated immediately. We were lucky we came at that time, because as soon as we placed our order the place started to fill up! They even opened the second room.

We started with a sweet tea and a half and half. Super sweet and yummy.

For the meal, we decided to share the Rev. Al Sharpton. This is chicken & waffle. We opted for the fried chicken and this was excellent. It was so much food and fresh out of the fryer. This was more than enough for two people. Plus we received complementary biscuits. Yum!

Everything was excellent.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Craving soul food one night we decided to stop at the famous Amy Ruth's. Of course I went for the chicken waffles  and a side of Mac n cheese. The chicken was delicious and complimented the sweet waffles perfectly. The Mac n cheese was alright but was way too salty.

We must have gotten there right before dinner time because about 20 mins after they sat us, there was a long line of people waiting to be seated outside. I will definitely be making my way back here!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amy Ruth's,"I came to Amy Ruth's for my birthday dinner with my family this year. I wanted a low key restaurant with good food. We came here on a Wednesday night, the day of my birthday. We were seated right away in the other room of the restaurant. There was not much people here. The restaurant itself is cool, clean and the decor was different. The restaurant menu had a lot of options, there was so much to choose from.

My family and I ordered the fried whiting. It came with Tatar sauce. It was really good. We had to order some more because it went so fast. For our entrées, we all ordered something different. I ordered The Ludacris which was 4 fried chicken wings with two sides. I ordered macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes. The food was overall ok, my chicken wings were cooked well but I wish it was juicer. It was a little on the dry side. My macaroni and cheese was a little tasteless, definitely needed more flavor. The mashed potatoes were really good. There was bits of potatoes and the gravy was full of flavor. Loved it. My family also liked the food but they said it was just okay.

All in all I would come back. The food wasn't the best I've had but it was good. I wanna come for brunch since my friend said she loved their brunch.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amy Ruth's,A great spot for you if you'd looking for southern food. Chicken was well seasoned and JUICY! But the mac and cheese was mmm mmm good!

Amy Ruth's,"I've been to Amy Ruths many times, my go to place when i want some good soul food, but this time around it was just not the same. The food just wasnt as good as before. The Mac n Cheese for some reason the cheese was whole (not melted) inside the Mac as if not blended in properly. The Yams were great and the chicken as well. as for the environment i was seated upstairs this time, didnt even know they had an upstairs and there was a bad stench, just was not as other times Ive been there.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

I chose the Mac and Cheese and the waitress recommended the collard greens for my second side. Both were fantastic, with the Mac and cheese being some of the best I've ever had. Kids had chicken wings and waffles and loved them.

Amy Ruth's,"I've always heard good things about this restaurant and tried to give it a go. The place has always been recommended highly specifically their Mac and cheese. I ordered honey fried chicken, Mac and candy yams. I was not impressed. I think what would help would be to at least chop the chickens for the patrons. It will cook better and be a little easier to eat. My friend who has the same sides but with regular chicken wings pointed out the food wasn't as good as her previous times there.

It could possibly be because it was a Sunday which seems to be a busy day for them. For whatever reason the front of house staff seemed to be understaffed. I have to commend their teamwork in trying to be as patient, understanding and cohesive as they possibly could because it was so hectic. 5 stars to the staff, they were trying their best and I appreciate good work ethic when the conditions are not ideal. I hope you guys get a better grip on the Sunday rush, more kitchen staff, takeout, hostesses etc. I'd like to give it another try.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

For those of us that are African American and grew up eating soul food, just know that your grandma and Auntie can cook much better food than what's being served at Amy Ruth's. On the bright side the portion sizes are really big and you will definitely leave stuffed.

The decor of the restaurant is truly what makes it special, the walls are covered in portraits of influential African Americans in history. Amy Ruth's is definitely a New York classic, however do not come here if you're looking for the best soul food in Harlem.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,Loved everything ! Maybe not the rice and peas but everything else was amazing. The service was top notch. Everyone got their food at the same time so no awkward moments of waiting for others to get their plates. They even brought out an extra side because a friend mentioned it (free). Also give us more corn bread without a fuss. The mimosa could have been way better though kinda sad but the food made it worth it. I had the honey fried chicken and lawdddddd it was delicious. Everything was seasoned and made with love  definitely going back .,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Amy Ruth's was my destination and reason for coming up to Harlem from Midtown. It was a great experience that I would gladly repeat, as I spotted several items on the menu I wish I had additional room in my tummy for.  Next trip.

The greeter at the door, who also directs folks to their table was super nice and friendly.  So are were their customers, my fellow diners.  While waiting for a table, I got some great recommendations from a New Orleans native for good authentic southern food in her hometown.  

The complimentary corn bread was really soft, moist and flavorful. A great way to start off.  I was strategically planning on having just a couple of bites, but after the first bite, my whole plan went awry quickly, and, I finished the cornbread in its entirety, in just a few minutes flat.

I got their famous fried chicken and waffles, along with the macaroni and cheese. The chicken must be fried to order, because it came out piping hot, just the way it would if you removed it from the bubbling hot oil at home.  The waffle was generous in size with crispy edges, but parts of the center were softer than I would've preferred. And yes, the Mac and cheese was just as cheesy as Yelpers have described.  I mean, cheeeesy! For me, that's a positive.

Servers were all nice and prompt in this super casual environment.

They have daily specials too.  I'll be back to try their homemade chicken and dumplings.

Inevitably, I'm certain there will be folks out there asking themselves if it's safe to come to Amy Ruth's.  I can hear them thinking it now. ""Is it safe in Harlem?"", they're secretly wondering.  I can only tell you that, as a woman, I came on a weekday afternoon, by myself, and felt totally 100% safe in Harlem. Never for a minute did I feel unsafe on the subway ride or walking around from Amy Ruth's to the Apollo Theater, and then to Bill Clintons' office.  In fact, I felt a hundred times safer in Harlem, than I do in broad daylight in San Francisco's Tenderloin district or even in parts of touristy Union Square at night, both areas in San Francisco which are in a serious state of decay!  That said, if you reside in the suburbs somewhere, and never leave your three mile comfort zone, except maybe for work, then maybe you should stay in Times Square.  However, you'll be missing out on good southern food at Amy Ruth's, and missing out on life.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,The food was good. I had the fried chicken with grits and collard greens. The only negative thing is that it took forever for them to take our order we waited almost 15 min and they also took a while to cash us out. Other then that it's a good place for some soul food,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Amy Ruth's is pretty good! But coming from Atlanta, I can rate it average! Lol. Here's the breakdown of what we ordered - pork ribs was the best meat out of the fried chicken and whiting fish. The whiting fish came out huge! Like, I've never seen two big pieces of whiting fish ever! It was seasoned to perfection & definitely a take home. The fried chicken was average - we had the honey on the side instead of dipped. The macaroni and cheese was uber good, the candied yams was just as good! The potato salad was delicious and went very well with the pork rib. The fried okra was a disappointment since it wasn't fully covered in batter, like how I like it and lastly, the cornbread - it was yummy! I can tell it was like a blend of jiffy and cornmeal, if you like sweet cornbread and in my case, I do, so it was perfect! Overall - very good southern Resturant in Harlem!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"The food here is some of the best southern style cooking you can find in the tri-state area. The cost of a meal is a bit higher than you are likely to find at other places, but the portions make it well worth your money. If you're in Harlem and you want Soul Food, order from Amy Ruth's. I will, however, warn anybody who eats here that service is AWFUL.  The manager and the staff are inattentive, unorganized and unprofessional. On my last visit, one of the managers stood at the register arguing with a man at the door (possibly a server) for five minutes in front of a restaurant full of customers. I stood for twenty minutes in front of her while she ignored me. I had ordered my food twenty minutes BEFORE I arrived and just wanted to pay for my food. To make matters worse, when another manager came out, she took my money and had no idea that none of my orders were even complete. Amid all the chaos, no one bothered to tell them that the stuff I ordered was still in the oven. In the end, I waited a total of 30 minutes for a manager to bring my order out to my car like it was a Sonic's....#raggedy
Again, the food here is worth trying, but this place needs competent and efficient staff and management.  My experience was so poor I won't be back any time soon. Good luck to anyone who ventures in this place.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Had high hopes. Usually when we're in NYC and craving soul food, we'll hit up Sylvia's.  It's been a few years and when I checked out the yelp reviews i felt there was a slight nod to Amy Ruth's.  So we decided to give it a try.   I ordered fried chicken, mac n' cheese, collards and a half/half.  The drink came out first and it was super concentrated, like syrup.  I drank half and diluted the remaining half with water and it was still strong.  The server also brought out some corn bread while we waited for our meals. The cornbread was excellent; moist and cakey with real corn, sweet but not too sweet.
Next came our meals.  My chicken breast was enormous.  It was well fried, crispy and flavorful, but it was almost too big. The ratio of meat to crunchy exterior was off. I would have actually preferred a smaller portion, because once i got finished eating the first layer of chicken I was left with lots more chicken meat but no more delicious crispy skin. It's hard to knock a restaurant for having portion sizes that are too big - but when I think back on all the fried chicken my aunt and grandma made, it occurred to me that maybe that's why they always went with the smaller fryer breasts.  Accompanying my chicken were two small bowls, one filled with mac n cheese and one with greens. The mac n cheese was decent. Not great, but certainly decent. No complaints. The collards on the other hand were dry and tough. They had good enough flavor, but eating them was not fun.
All in all it wasn't a bad meal by any means, but neither was it a great meal.  It definitely didn't live up to my memory of Sylvia's and I am guessing the next time we're in NY and craving good soul food, we'll head back there. But it was nice to try a new place and I wish Amy Ruth's well.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

If your restaurant has this issue then please close from 11:30 to 12 and then re-Open for lunch. At 12:30 we had had enough and walked out.

Amy Ruth's,Very good chicken and waffles. The syrup was ok. Cornbread was sooooo good and the service is extremely fast. Worth the trip during a New York visit.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Don't be turned off by the long lines and the modest-looking interior as you peer in from the outside. There's far more room in an upstairs dining room, and there's a good deal of substance to make up for what Amy Ruth's might lack in superficial style.

The entrees might seem a tad spendy, but you're getting a family-sized helping of meat with your order. Pro tip: pace yourself and save some for leftovers - or at least share some with a good group of folks. I got the combo of BBQ pork spare ribs and grilled chicken and was already full by the time I'd finished the chicken. And that was before digging into the two sides (who can resist the mac n' cheese?).

Service is fast and efficient. I see that it's closed temporarily because of ConEdison construction along the street, but here's to Amy Ruth's coming back and going strong for many more years to come.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,Great soul food I love the catfish can't mess that up and the Mac and cheese is good to ! I normally stick to what I know you can't mess up I'm just funny with collard greens  growing up my mom soaked hers in the kitchen sink and I thought that was gross so my conscious won't let me order things like that over all great food two entrees came up to like 50$ bit with the desserts it and drinks it was like 7($ for the two of us,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I had to give it a 4. The very first Time the fried chicken was Delicious, the Mac and cheese was on point!!!!

Maybe a different cook that day.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,My brother and I traditionally go to Amy Ruth's once a month. It's our sibling date. Their chicken is well seasoned and fried to perfection! The waffle is buttery and tasty; the perfect companion! Oufff and their Mac and cheese is delicious. We usually share an order of Mac and cheese. I throw red hots sauce on my chicken for a little heat which is perfectly balanced with the buttery syrup. I love that they have a kool aid flavor of the day and we always get this. It just rounds out the meal perfectly. This place is usually packed but totally worth the wait. I usually go around 10 on Sunday to avoid the churchgoers. Service is quick and efficient as they want to move patrons out quickly. Which is a plus I never feel rushed to finish my meal. The decor is quintessential old Harlem which I appreciate!!

I was really excited for chicken and waffles. I somehow found chicken to be extremely hard to chew. I guess they fried it multiple times? Anyway,  it was too dry for me.. it was worth the try though.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

We had the jerk chicken, juicy and flavorful, fall off the bone! Collard greens can be eaten by itself it's so delicious.  Cabbage, green beans, potato salad amazing. Fried Whiting had a buttery flavor, although it DID have some bones. Employees are very nice, checked up on us a couple times and welcoming. Service outstanding! Also, the music in there very good!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amy Ruth's,"A solid brunch standby when visiting friends in Harlem. So much comfort and so filling. Will have to try the other waffle combos sometime, but the classic Rev. Al Sharpton is just so delicious.

The Rev Al Sharpton: Fried Chicken & Waffles, it really doesn't get much better than this.  The chicken was very crispy on the outside and moist inside. The waffle was perfectly fluffy. They have ample syrup and hot sauce to customize it to your liking.

Homemade Baked Mac & Cheese: Not oozing gooey cheese like a baked to order dish. Kinda like the texture of reheated lasagne, but made up of mac & cheese. It was fine for what it was, I'm just not a fan of the baked style.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"I really had hope for this restaurant after hearing about it and honestly It was disappointing.   I've eaten at many Soul Food restaurants, majority of them in the south and Amy Ruth's can't come close.   I had the fried chicken with waffle.  The waffle was thick and tasted like it's made from a corn meal batter,  the fried chicken left much to be desired. It's definitely overpriced, but it is Harlem so I guess thats NY dining prices.  The only plus for me is that we supported a Black owned establishment1",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants

Amy Ruth's,"The fried chicken - perfect!
The waffle - perfect!
I had the Rev. Al Sharpton Waffle, with thigh and leg meat, smothered.
First off, the fried chicken is literally fall-off-the-bone tender, and juicy to boost.  The waffle was equally as tender, and the perfect pairing to the chicken.
My eyes were bigger than my stomach and while I thought I could finish, there was still 1/4 of the waffle that I wanted to take home, and without even having to ask, one of the waitstaff brought me a container for my leftovers. Service was excellent here!  Everyone seems to have a good time, and if I'm ever that far up in the city, I'll be sure to stop by and check out some of their other offerings.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Let me start off by saying the food was good but not the best in the neighborhood for soul food. I feel like it was generally overpriced I paid almost 30 for a filet of catfish, three shrimp, and a crab cake. The sides are good portion though. I had fried okra which weren't really fried, since they were incredibly soft with no crunch. But I did enjoy there cornbread. It was sweet and came in a generous portion.

I would come here again if the service would have been better. The waitstaff is kind but very slow. We waited 35 minutes for them to run our cards. It was ridiculous since the restaurant wasn't very crowded when we went (5:30pm on a Wednesday). They should lower their prices or have better service.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/amy-ruths-new-york?osq=restaurants
Amy Ruth's,"Oh my, these empanadas are so so great. Get the shredded chicken one. You will be in heaven. Right now, I think you can only get take a way. I was there in February and was able to eat there.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"COVID 19 situation: Stopped in to grab a quick bite after dinner. They have so many types of empanadas to choose from and also serve cocktails.

We got six empanadas- Mac N' Cheese, Eggplant Parmesan, Spicy chicken, Pepperoni Pizza, Reggaeton and Shredded beef.

All the empanadas were fresh and delicious. It's hard to choose the best one, but I really liked the pepperoni pizza- it was my favourite! My least favourite was the eggplant empanada just because I am not a big fan of eggplants.

Would love to go back to the restaurant again after the pandemic and try different flavours while exploring NYC!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

I loved the Mama's Cuban Sandwich , everything about it was amazing. I got the side salad with my sandwich and it was so good, it had a little bit of cumin in the dressing and was so refreshing. All of the empanadas we got were amazing but my favorite was the corn four empanada filled with bbq pulled pork. This is a must try restaurant!

On my way home, I happened to see Empanada Mama which I haven't eaten at since leaving LES more than a year ago! I was so excited and it was perfect timing as I was getting hungry.

I ordered my usual Viagra (shrimp) and shredded chicken empanada. Pro-tip: if you don't like the red hot sauce, ask for a second green sauce (addicted to that green sauce!)

I was going to eat them at home but decided to enjoy them on the bench outside while they were piping hot and crispy. Afterall, the ride home would take another hour.

Service is friendly. Ordering is inside but there is a lot of open air flow coming from the entirely open front entrance. Two benches to wait and eat.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"These are the best empanadas in Manhattan. Whether fried or oven-baked, it's impossible to choose a ""wrong"" flavor.

Empanada Mama's wide variety of options is a big selling point, in my opinion. Nowhere else have I seen such creative combinations, some inspired by cuisines such as Greek, Italian, and Polish. Plenty of them happen to be vegetarian as well: I've had the spinach & cheese, eggplant parmesan, broccoli & cheese, and veggie empanadas. Most are made using wheat flour, but there are corn flour alternatives. The spinach & cheese is my favorite, even though it's simple - the filling is just mozzarella and sautéed spinach inside a fried wheat flour pastry.

Anyone who isn't a fan of empanadas doesn't have to worry, either. They serve various tapas, arepas, and sandwiches; they also have salads, for those in search of something lighter.

About six years ago, when I first visited the restaurant, it was narrow and cramped. Unfortunately, in 2016, Empanada Mama was forced to temporarily close, due to a fire. A year later, they reopened near their original location, but in a significantly larger space, allowing them to accommodate a greater number of guests. The new place has a bar, full dining room, and open layout. The pastel color scheme outside the restaurant is inviting, fun, and difficult to miss, which is a very good thing, because no one should pass up the chance to give these empanadas a try.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

We tried the hame and cheese and pepperoni for late night snacks and were impressed by these little empanadas! The filling is pretty heavy and stuffed.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Oh, Mama! I'm so glad we chose to come here for dinner. Wasn't planned, but based on your Yelps I wanted to come and happy we did.

Our party of six without a reservation in the heart of dinner rush was able to be immediately seated by the friendly hostess. She said we could wait if we didn't want to be in a cramped table in the corner, but it worked out just fine.

Started with the plantains and guacamole (both are made in-house), and an order of the plantain nachos. Both were awesome. The guacamole  had just enough kick even though the choices were light or spicy, and the nachos had a great amount of beef and cheese and goodness. I quickly downed a frozen margarita and moved on to a red sangria. Margarita was the right blend of liquor to mix, but the sangria was too much wine and not enough everything else.

Our multiple empanadas were the BOMB! Not a bad one in the bunch. Most of us bought two, but I needed a third.  Loved the Cubano, but really loved the Jerk Chicken and Cheese. Got a second of that one. Everyone loved their food which was perfection on a plate. No complaints.

Service was on point and friendly.

Everything arrived earlier than expected. Which is great! The bag was spill free. My order is correct and everything was warm.
The arepa again had cheese stuck on the foil. I think wax paper or parchment paper would be a better choice. It was good though.
The viagra empanada was good too but the crab is imitation. The shrimp was cooked well. Great flavors.
The jerk n' cheese was good too. Not spicy at all. Chicken was cooked perfect though.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"We were walking around Hell's Kitchen being touristy and then all of a sudden we remembered that we had been shopping and having so much fun that we forgot to eat. Normally I have such a hard time deciding where to go because I never want to eat somewhere bad but this time the options for good food were endless. At the end we decided to go to Empanada Mama. Absolute gem and the service is amazing.

We sat at the bar. I got my g&t and two empanads, the viagara and something else which didn't have such a memorable name. The viagara is a seafood stew empanda that basically is packed with flavor. I really wish I had ordered more of it. But I had ordered the other one which I think was the portobella one and it was good as well but I didn't realize that it came with ground beef. I had almost all of it even though I am not a big fan of ground meat.

The bartender working where we sat was hilarious and kept me company whenever I must have looked bored (AKA before my food came out). Overall, I really enjoyed this place and will definitely go back if I am in the area and have a hankering for empanadas.

I love empanadas and I was told this is the place to go to. Since I don't eat meat, I got the cheese and pizza empanadas. The pricing is not bad; it's $4 for one empanada. They typically come with what tastes like an avacdo-ish sauce and a tangy spicy sauce.
I love the fact that within a few minutes you have your empanadas. This is good and bad in a sense; bad that it's previously made and they fry it on the spot. However, they still taste yummy.
Each day they have a drinks special that can range anywhere from $5-8 which isn't bad.

The plantain chips are pretty good too... but the guacamole is lacking in flavor... you can tell it's fresh which is a plus (and much appreciated); but it's missing something... not salt but maybe lime juice and spices.

EM has a simple setup - it stands out from surrounding eateries on 9th Ave by having a long green awning. Inside, there's a bar area as well as a number of tables. There's nothing too striking about the decor but it worked - touches of color here and there made the aesthetics casual and welcoming.

I of course wanted empanadas, and skimming the menu I noticed they had a huge selection. Before that, however - we got drinks and apps. We both got the red sangria which was really good but damn it was strong, one was plenty for a mid-afternoon meal. We also ordered some plantain chips with guac. They gave a lot of chips which was a plus - the guac was fine but I've had more flavorful variations other places.

Empanadas are $3.99 each, and are broken down by how they're prepared - regular (fried), oven baked, and corn crust. I went with three of the traditionally prepared ones: pernil, shredded beef, and shredded chicken. I really enjoyed all of them - a decent size, not over-fried, and chock full of fillings. They were also paired with two sauces that really worked well with all of them. My colleague also ordered an arepa; I sampled a bit and it was quite good.

Service was great - fast and friendly which I really appreciated. Overall, I had a good time at Empanada Mama. They put out solid food that you can enjoy any time of day (like really, they're open 24 hours). I would definitely return to try more of their offerings.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"We were here to try their varieties of empanadas. Ordered the cheesesteak, buffalo chicken, pepperoni pizza, and 2 others that I don't remember. The dipping sauce was really good. We ordered all the fried empanadas so it was a bit oily but next time I will try the baked ones and see how it goes. The service was great and fast.

Juicy ham and pineapple with mozzarella cheese!
Wet, slobbery beef of other empanada choices.
Of course, their sauces ! They give just enough every time.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"I stopped by Empanada Mama yesterday for a quick bite and although I wasn't blown away by anything, I still had a nice dining experience here.
I ended up ordering the Viagra empanada (seafood) and the pernil empanada. Both of these were delicious and worth every penny. I also ordered the Colombian sausage tapa (comes with arepa) and this was just OK (nothing special).
Lastly, they have all-day daily drink specials and I visited on a Monday so the special was a classic frozen margarita for $8. Pretty good and not skimpy with the alcohol. Overall, I could definitely see myself coming back to try some of their other empanadas since their list is extensive. I might also try to come back during their happy hour next time since their prices for drinks look pretty good.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Empanada Mama is in the heart of hells kitchen.

I went with a friend to do a pick up order. He's my short review of it.

Pros:
It was pretty good
There was a huge menu selection

Cons:
Wait time was long
It's expensive

The place is pretty pricey for each empanada, and I can't say I got what I paid for. While I did enjoy it once, I don't think I'll be going back cause of the price to enjoyment ratio being under the bar.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Went here with a co-worker when we were in town for work.  The transit employees recommended it to us.  Could see why now.  The food was delicious and staff were very friendly.  We sat at the bar and the layout wasn't anything eye popping.  The food was.  Ordered the buffalo chicken, pulled pork, and Philly cheese steak empanadas.  Nice and crispy on the outside and flavorful on the  inside.  Didn't really need the sauce.  Philly cheesesteak was my favorite.   For dessert I ordered the hot chocolate and churros special.  Churros were epic, it's been a long time since I had a churro.  Hot chocolate wasn't memorable.  

I would recommend this place if you have a chance.  Good food and friendly employees, chatted it up with the bartenders and had a good time after a long work day.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Slow service on a weeknight. And the few times I have been here I have noticed poor service. Other than that, I quite enjoy the food at this establishment.

- The Nachos made with plantain chips are so delicious and I have to get it each time I am here. It's a pretty large portion so it's great to share!
- Their guac is also pretty good here, but nothing too out of the ordinary.

My favorite empanada is the El bandito but overall their empanadas aren't bad. The sizes are small so you definitely have to have a few!

It's open late so it's a great place to have a late night bite.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Only in nyc can you get authentic food 24/7. Such a great place to go with your significant other and just nom down on a huge variety of empanadas for a decent price. My favorite was the del toro (oxtail).

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Yes, I went to Empanada Mama and did not order empanadas. Mistakes were made. Instead, I went for the Cubana Arepa, with Sofrito-seasoned roast pork, Cuban-style black beans and mozzarella cheese. I ordered it expecting it to be just as soft, moist, and delicious as the one I had a few years ago but was disappointed when I put into its dry, flaky top. I think this is because this arepa was probably fried, unlike the grilled one I had years ago. Aside from its dryness, the arepa did deliver with lots of pork and gooey cheese. However, it didn't really taste like anything special and I would not order it again.

Stick with the empanadas and don't be tempted by the other enticing menu options!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Been ordering lunch here to bring to the convention center for the past few days. Empanadas are of course the thing to  order here, but if you need a break from those because you've been ordering from this place all week like we did, you do have alternatives in a menu. I particularly enjoyed the pastor tacos which were probably the equivalent of an empanada each as far as filling and had excellent flavor. Corn tortillas and helped along with a little green sauce.

Favorite empanadas thus far are the viagra (which uses fake crab meat in case you're a snob about that) and the bandito with the Cuban earning honorable mention. They are all well put together so just find a flavor profile you like or order 3 or 4 and you'll like more than you don't. Girls were doing 2-3 for a meal, boys were going 3-4, I did tacos (comes as a set of 3) and 2 empanadas but was struggling at the end.

Price point is reasonable and despite being about as far away from the Mexican border as you can get, it's damn good food and a top lunch choice for the team.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Stopped in quickly to order some empanadas to go while in the Midtown Area. The restaurant was busy, but we were immediately greeted and promptly helped with placing our order. They had several empanadas to select from, some made with a wheat wrapper and others with corn. My husband and I ordered the Hawaiian, Beef, Pepperoni Pizza, Cheese Pizza, and Caramel & Cheese. We would not recommend either of the pizza empanadas (I know we should have known better), as the mix of the mozzarella, sauce, and wrapper did not go well together. The Hawaiian and Beef were amazing! The Beef was stuffed with meat and crusting of the empanada wrapper was light enough to really taste the flavor of the beef. It was heavenly. The Hawaiian was also packed with stuffing and flavor. The pineapple added a nice touch to the overall taste. The Caramel & Cheese empanada cam from the dessert section of the menu. It was good and satisfied our end of meal sweet tooth craving.

Although the restaurant was busy when we came in, our to go order came out super fast. All workers we came across were friendly and helpful. We would definitely love to visit Empanada Mama again and sit down to eat at their establishment.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Empanada Mama's customer service by phone is terrible! Each time I've called, I've been put on hold several times for a very simple question (are utensils included? Can I confirm the delivery time?), and they just keep passing the phone off to someone else who has no idea what's going on. Each time they take me off hold, I have to provide my name and order information all over again.

The catering order we made through ezcater.com logistically worked out great. They provide serving utensils and napkins, but we had to get our own plates and eating utensils (Ezcater would have added those for $0.50 a person).

I only got to try the chicken and the beef empanadas, they were good though a little try in the middle, but great with the dipping sauce.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Pricey but it's 24 hours so it's great. Their menu is expansive but all their empanadas are pretty delicious.

They have two homemade sauces, a creamy green cilantro one and a vinegar based red sauce, but I always also get a side of their chimichurri sauce as well when I'm there. Especially if I'm getting their oxtail soup, which I order at least half the time I stop by.

It's usually crowded in the evenings, and is definitely a neighborhood hang as well, so it's always a good time.

They offer different types of empanadas as well, which I really appreciate, so good nod there.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"This place! OMG! These are some of the best empanadas I've ever had and the atmosphere is electrifying! Living around the corner from here is dangerous but it also allows me to see the restaurant from different perspectives.
Lunchtime: A quieter crowd mixed with locals, business people and visitors. They also offer lunch specials which can help you out on cash.
Dinner/Late Night: The drinks are cranking out (try the spicy paloma or a frozen margarita with a coconut/strawberry swirl). The same menu is available but for some reason I feel like I can order more since it's dinner.
Delivery: Always fast and delicious. Quality is not compromised when you have their food delivered.
The bartenders are friendly, the servers and attentive and the rest of the staff are equally busy buzzing around the joint.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Been here tons of times before since it's one of the best empanada joints in the city. It used to be much smaller but today the location seemed much different, has a lot more space and became more of a hangout/bar type of place which is great. Had to take it to go today but will definitely come back for a sit in.

I got the following today:

Cheese pizza - very warm, fresh, and cheeessy! This ones a classic, add lots of green sauce.

Eggplant parm - this ones new so had to try it! It was amazing!!

Greek spinach pie - great combo!

Guava and mozz - favorite dessert of them all. Really creative combo and has the perfect sweet and salty mixture.

No pics, Bc these are always meant to be devoured.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"As the name suggests empanadas are the best here. I went for wheat empanadas - Viagra and spicy chicken empanadas. Spicy chicken was my favorite. Viagra was good as well. I would say 3 empanadas per person is enough for dinner for a normal person. You may be able to eat up to 5 empanadas in one sitting. I also went for the spicy guac with plantain chips. Spicy guac was not spicy at all. Plaintain chips was good. But my recommendation is to just stick to different kinds of empanadas, and skip other things.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Came here for my first time with a friend who is a Fordham at Lincoln Center campus student - I was very impressed by the decor, ample seating, take out options and all the empanada/food options

I ordered the viagra (seafood) empanada, Cuban empanada and reggaton empanada. My friend and I also ordered passion fruit margaritas that were strong and delicious

Service was a bit slow to see a waiter to order but they brought out empanadas out pretty quickly

The food was delicious and fresh (and cheap!). Our waiter brought us two small sides of sauce for our empanadas - I used the green sauce (I believe avocado based) and it was delish!

Pros:
+ big menu, tons of options
+ many types of empanadas
+ group seating available
+ cute decor
+ strong drinks
+ take out and delivery options!

Cons:
+ cannot split the bill

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"If only I can rate this place a 0 for the kind of establishment this place is. Last night I had gotten bodied on the ground when a manager did absolutely nothing but record and watch a fight bound to happen between my friends and another group of people. Kicked out for being victims, as for the other tables in the restaurant were also shocked they were kicking us out for being attacked, couldn't take/finish what we ordered, and FORCED TO PAY.

We were seated in front of the bathroom with one seat in the walkway. As a restaurant, you should know how to seat customers so there'd be no problem. As we were going on our business, a guy who looked out of it tried to pick a fight with my friend as he was trying to go to the bathroom. My friend moved in as much as he could, and even pushed in the chair behind him that had no one sitting in it, the drunk guy could've pushed it himself instead of trying to act out. When the drunk guy came out the bathroom, he decides to try and pass by my friend again instead of going the other way, clear of seats and people. He touches my friend and yells out ""CAN YOU MOVE?"" and my friend gets up and puts him in his place, walks out the restaurant to cool down.

I followed my friend out to give him a smoke and two of our friends follow us because they were worried something was going to happen. Correct, 5 seconds later drunk guy walks out WITH A PLATE and throws it at us. Me being in the middle of it all at the wrong place and time, got my hair grabbed by this drunk guy and slammed on the side of the sidewalk. This whole time manager is not stopping the fight, just calling the cops, who also did nothing.

Point blank, if you want to go to an unsafe place where the manager does absolutely nothing to keep you safe from drunk and crackheads, records the whole thing to watch, AND makes you pay for your uneaten food and drinks, EMPANADA MAMA IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! :)",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Whether its empanadas at 2 in the afternoon or 2 in the morning, Empanada Mama knows how to warm my heart and stomach.

Food:
Haven't been to Empanada Mama in a while but the food is good as ever! I started off with the Fried Yuca and plantain chips, the yuca has a drizzle of guava and what tasted like sour cream/ranch, it was absolutely delicious on its own or paired with the guac it came with. I ordered the ham and cheese, spicy chicken, pernil, and cheese empanada. The ham and cheese is a classic one I love! The spicy chicken is a little spicy but super tender, a little of the green salsa is good on it. The pernil was so flavorful, I could have had 3 more. The cheese was alright, I got it in the corn empanada, crunchy and good.

Price:
Yuca Frita and Plantain Chips: $11.75
Flour, Corn, & Oven Baked Empanadas: $3.99

Vibe:
The servers at Empanada Mama are all very nice and friendly. They speak both English and Spanish, a big plus! The energy inside is vibrant and while the tables are close to one another there's ample space between them were it doesn't feel too cramped.

The cheeseburger empanada(pictured) was super yummy, as was the mac'n'cheese empanada that has bacon in it as well, I personally wasn't a huge fan of the jerk'n cheese option.

It was pretty busy and our food still came out pretty quickly and was very tasty. This place is good if you just want a little snack, or a full meal. Definitely would recommend!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Empanadas here are $4 a pop. Wow. Super pricey and small which was a little off-putting. BUT I figured I'd try it because the types of empanadas are so unique! I ordered the Viagra and reggae. The Viagra was delicious and packed with shrimp, imitation crab, and I think scallops. I couldn't really tell which was which but the flavors blended beautifully together. I'm guessing they call it the Viagra because it's kind of like a seafood orgasm in your mouth haha!

The reggae was not as yummy. It was pretty dry and lacked the Caribbean punch I expected. Seems like a thoughtful menu idea to have though. I'd be interested to try more empanadas from this place if there was like an empanadas happy hour.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"This place was awesome! Judging by a lot of the restaurants in Hell's kitchen, I expected a tiny seating area, but there was a big open bar at the front and generous seating near the back. Me, the hubster, and my brother stopped in here for breakfast, just expecting to try the empanadas, but were excited to see that they had breakfast specials!

I think the place is better known for lunches, though, because there was only one other group there. Awesome prices for a cup of coffee and a breakfast plate that was too big to finish.

We ordered three empanadas that came out before the food, which is fine because we were starving and ready to chow down. They were a great size, and I could probably be satisfied with two as an entire meal. We were recommended the viagra, which was a seafood combination (shrimp, I think scallops too). It was definitely the best of the bunch. Absolutely delicious and surprisingly not dripping with grease. We also ordered the portabello, which was far too mushroomy for me, but hubster devoured it. The buffalo chicken was interesting, kind of spicy but a definite departure from what we expected empanadas could be. There were so many choices that we could probably have come back five or six times and not try them all.

When the breakfast got there, we were already half full, so the size of the plates were almost overwhelming. I had the huevos rancheros, which was super tasty with a good crunch. Tons of beans. Hubster had the Tortilla Paisa, which was kind of like an omelette with potatoes mixed in and plantains on top. The potatoes were like tasty little french fries mixed into the eggs. My brother got the french toast, which isn't quite like french french toast, its definitely a Hispanic spin. There was no syrup, but it came with a chocolate or caramel sauce, which made it good.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Seriously though the food is amazing. I love the empanadas. Some of my favorites are the Viagra, Desayuno Americano, Cuban and Romeo & Juliet for dessert. The plantain chips and guacamole are awesome.

It's skirt steak, which is the cheapest cut. It likely costs them $3 to make and they charge close to $30 for it. However, it's so good, the meat is well marinated, and with the chimi churi sauce and their green hot sauce are amazing. omg, I could have it every day. The empanadas are good as well.

It was probably after midnight, and I had a taste for their eggplant parmigiana empanadas (tomato, oregano, basil, red wine, parmesan & mozzarella cheese). The wait wasn't long, and the empanadas were just as cheesy and flavorful as I remembered them to be. My favorite, though, is the complementary side of salsa (green & red) they bring to the table prior to the arrival of your empanadas. If Empanada Mama ever starts selling it by the bottle, I want a case of it.

When chicken was still part of my diet, the Pollo Guisado (stewed chicken in sofrito sauce, yellow peppers, potato and garlic served with rice) was my absolute favorite. Pour the green salsa into the dish, and it gets even better.

1. Pizza -- just go get a nice Italian calzone, that will be more financially sound
2. Broccoli + Cheddar -- meh.
3. Spinach + Mozz - decent but again calzone..
4. Portobello Mushroom - not the biggest fan mushroom much BUTT this was delicious!!! It was my FAVORITE one one here and makes for a decent to-go snack (if ever in the area)

ALSO, make sure you ask for the chipotle mayo sauce, it's a stupid price for a sauce/quality & quantity BUT mix their green cilantro sauce with that mayo --- you can thank me later. That sauce made my meal so satisfying!!  

Ambiance wise, it has a cute interior. Great service, we came here for a quick bite before a show and our waiter was able to get our order in quick and helped us stay on time.

I could be harsh, but maybe I have to accept empanadas are not really meant to be vegetarian friendly. They originate from a culture that has meat heavy.

It had great flavor and tasted wonderful with the green sauce and hot sauce mixed together. Although the viagra is one of the most popular empanadas, it did not wow me. I feel like it lack flavor and the shrimp were over cooked. The pernil was a bit dry.

I also ordered a Schofferhofer on tap and it was very flat but I didn't have time to complain. This is my three time visiting this location and every time I order a drink there is an issue. So I will not be ordering anymore drinks here.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"This is the 3rd time I've gone there and literally felt disrespected from Denise....first time my girlfriend mentioned it I told her relax and stop over thinking...2nd time we came back she said the same exact thing ONLY to realize she was the same person as before. I brushed it off because the actual servers were usually great. But Yesterday I can honestly say I felt it so I made sure to get her name.

I tried to call to place an order after an hr or so got no response so I decided to just make my way. No problem at all. Whatever. Get there pulled up the menu from my phone placed an order Denise tells me that its a menu but for a different company that ""stole the name or has the same name"". I show her the menu... reggaeton, viagra, the name of the company and the location presented on the menu which matches. She tells me it isn't them. (Mind u I come here maybe 2-3 times a months) cool.

So I'm asking for different things in an attempt to place an order. Viagra, brasil....she puts them in then she's telling me they've NEVER had some of the items that were on the online...Tuna Melt empanada, satay chicken, Korean beef (STILL ADAMANT THAT THIS IS THE WRONG MENU) Okay cool. So since I spent about 5 minutes trying to place an order I just ask her for an updated or current menu (just because SOMETIMES online may not be accurate) she then points to a page in the menu and says this is all we have....nothing in specific just the page. Okay cool. I asked was is specifically just everything on this page and she confirms. I go to order and guess what it's not what they have...cool. Misinformed.

She then begins to cut me off pretty much speaking over me ""you have viagra and shredded chicken what else do you want"" I go to speak and she for the sh*t again...I can't make this up. I asked for her name and walked out.

I call LES location...and they inform me that there is a limited menu due to what's going on. PERFECT. He lets me know what my options are and communicated effectively and saved the day. Unfortunately Denise lacks knowledge of the company and is extremely horrible in terms of customer service.

Denise was unaware of the menu and did not communicate effectively. Denise did not know the online menu to be one of the companies and she literally told me it was a different place although it had the address. Denise was not poised nor could she handle pressure of the basic inquiries. This is my 3rd encounter with her and all 3 times her hospitality has been in question. This is just MY first time experiencing it directly.

Food is good but I will no longer be going to this location. MAYBE LES but that's out of my way I'll make it there if I make it there. I was ready to be a lifer here but there are some other places worth giving a shot at this point..

But definitely give EXOTIC EMPANADA or LATINERIA a shot...the food is roughly the same but whatever is missing their customer service will either bring them to or above empanada mamas",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"We enjoyed Empanada Mama's for a late night dessert. We were welcomed in, seated quickly and moved straight to the dessert menu.

Either it was too late or we all had too much anticipation because none of us took photos! Shame, shame.

That aside, we loved each and every yummy empanada we tasted: Romeo and Juliet, Sweet Figs, Belgian and Banana, and Coco and Dulce de Leche.

So incredible. And so happy they stay open late on a Sunday night!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"My friend and I came here on a Wednesday night around 6:30 PM and it was packed (definitely a good sign). Unfortunately we missed happy hour which looked promising with all margaritas for $5 and nearly double the price after 6 PM. Regardless, post-any exam require drinks! As we were waiting for our table at Pure Thai across the street, we ordered the Passion Fruit and Mango margaritas in addition to the Cuban and Spicy Chicken empanadas. The drinks were refreshing and the empanadas were tasty as well. The only downside is for the price I would expect them to be a little bigger but it wasn't a dealbreaker.  Overall, I am glad that they're doing great in Hell's Kitchen as I remember the East Village location closing down (though I don't remember why).",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"A STAPLE in one portobello mushroom empanada and an ELASTIC BAND in the other. NEVER, NEVER ordering from them again. My 3-year-old son almost had my empanada with a staple.

Owners, please adhere to basic safety protocols and fire those in your kitchen who clearly do not have training for proper hygiene or care for the safety of customers. Grossed out, disappointed and want to sue.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Great flavors! My husband had their steak and eggs... great seasonings, steak cooked perfectly and their potatoes were super delicious with a good onion and peppers ratio.

I had flour and corn empanadas, it took me home! We tried the Cuban, jerk chicken with cheese, mambo italiano (all three were good) but the home runners were viagra (seafood) and the traditional corn empanada stuffed with ground beef... men it made me think of my grandma, it was that good specially with the very good cup of coffee.

Very good to note, open 24 hours!!!! I wish I had found this gem earlier in our trip :(

We will be back for sure!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"This was my second time going to Empanada Mama however, I am hesitant to ever go back. My colleagues and I decided to go to Happy Hour based off of their affordable drink menu online. When we arrived, we were seated promptly and had a friendly waiter.

Everything was great until the check came. Instead of $5 margaritas (like what was posted on their happy hour menu), we were charged $13 because it was on the rocks. Understanding that this is the regular price for their margaritas, we spoke with our waiter who said there was nothing he could do. We then proceeded to speak with a manager who stated that the menu said specifically said ""frozen margaritas."" I tried to explain that the menu online states otherwise. She asked to see the menu and responded by saying they were ""trying to update the menu online...""

She said they had ""the right to change their menu without notice at any time"" and that there was ""nothing"" she could do for us. It was very disappointing to know that we couldn't be helped in any way especially knowing that the menu online was not valid. A warning or note on the menu indicating that the menu online was not valid in the restaurant would have been nice.

Honestly, to be charged over $150 more than what was expected was good enough to never have to go back. Second and last time for me.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"There was a large selection of choices on the menu which to some may be a good thing but to me I prefer restaurants with smaller range of menu options that can execute those options very well. The empanadas took some time to come out so I assume they were cooked to order (and can confirm by the temperature) which I do appreciate. The empanadas were fairly sized. I ordered the shredded beef, spicy chicken, and the Brazil. Shredded beef was the best, the spicy chicken was quite spicy but the meat was dry. The Brazil was pretty average.

If you're in the area and are craving empanadas I would maybe give this place a try but there are probably better options in the city if you're willing to commute a bit further.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"FOOD - ok. Empanada's are already good.
SERVICE - HORRIBLE. Host tend to be passive aggressively feisty.
They make you wait for table for 10-15mins, and then tell you exactly the same thing after 10-15mins for 3 or 4 times.

There are specific people who are very caring that works there but no everybody. Night manager acts as if she doesn't care yet try to care.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,Love the Romeo & Juliet dessert empanada. Sounds weird to have mozzarella cheese with guava but it's sooooo good.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Over the years the green sauce is getting pricier and pricier, but if you dine in it's free!

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"This place was good when they only had empanadas.
Now with the additions to their menu the food it's jus mediocre, service and food. I had a few empanadas and picada plate for 2. The empanadas were good but the picada was NASTY. The yuca fries were inedible, and when I mentioned to the nonexistent waitress she asked the manager who was eating outside food at a table next to ours, he replied by saying that the fries were over cooked.

The one start goes to the runner, who was friendly enough to provide sauce for our hard old fries.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"This is my first time at the new Empanada Mama. I actually had no idea the first one had suffered a fire, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the new and *much* improved Empanada Mama - bigger in space and menu, as well as a bar!

The menu was extensive, but I had my heart set on empanadas. So I ordered the Reggaeton and Spinach and Cheese. Both very delicious. The Spinach and Cheese had a beautiful cheese pull that I was not expecting. The Reggaeton was tasty with the rice and pork flavors.

I sat at the bar since I was dining solo, and it was packed - rightfully so for a Friday night. The bartender was attentive and friendly. The food came out promptly.

I'll definitely need to come back to try out the drinks and more items on the menu. For now, I'd say I had a five star experience.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"This place was amazing. I came here for dinner before a show with my wife and another couple. It was only a few blocks from the World Stage Theatre where we were going to a show, so it was conveniently located.  And who can say no to a good empanada?! The place was packed but we only had to wait 10 minutes to get seated. The server was very nice and attentive. For an appetizer we ordered the plantain chips and yucca frites. It came with a delicious guacamole with a nice kick. The yucca frites were amazing. They were cut thinner than usual yucca fries which actually worked. The frites were topped with a sweet and spicy guava sauce. It really worked! The plantain chips were also fresh and delicious.

For dinner, I got four empanadas, the Brazil, the El Toro (with oxtail), the Colombiana (with sausage and egg), and the corn flour beef. I also ordered a side of beans and rice. It was a lot even for me, and I can eat! My wife ordered the Cuban sandwich. The couple ordered the lentil soup and the Sancocho oxtail soup. Everyone loved their meals. The empanadas were definitely the star of the dinner. The Brazil was seasoned perfectly, and the olives and potatoes were unique and tasty additions. The corn flour beef were traditional and so darn good. It was seasoned and fried to perfection. The Brazil and corn flour beef were by far my favorites. The Colombiana was really tasty but seemed more breakfast like. The El Toro had some unique sweet caribbean flavors. It was good but not my favorite.

The rice and beans were delicious. The beans were tasty and the rice was cooked perfectly. The prices were also very reasonable. I cant wait to come here again.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Yummm, this place has good empanadas and food! Came here during happy hour, which had $5 beer and other drink specials. Place is pretty big and contains a good amount of seating so it's good for big parties.

I shared a plate of "" picada"" with my fiance. Its a mixed plate of grilled steak, chicken, yuca, chicharrron(pork belly), plantains and chorizo. Food was pretty good and was filling for both of us. My favorite was the pork belly cuz I love pork belly. It was nice and crispy. The chicken was a bit on the dry side but tastes good with the sauce. The red and green spicy sauce that they serve you is actually what made the food good. Without the sauce, food is decent. The two of us finished the whole plate and we were pretty satisfied. However we still ordered 2 empanadas on the side cuz we weren't sure if we would be full...and come on, place is called ""empanadas mama""... I gotta try empanadas.

I ordered the Pernil empanada since it was one of the waitress' recommendations. - it has pulled pork. It was flavorful and delicious. Empanada was stuffed with meat which was nice. I really enjoyed my empanada. The green sauce just made it better.

Ham and cheese- it was also pretty good, but so very american. It doesn't taste like an authentic empanada lol.. Tasted like the ham and cheese hot pockets which I used to always eat. So... It was good but I'd rather try something else more authentically flavored. (my fiance ordered it). We both agreed that the pernil empanada tasted best out of the 2 tho.

Overall, I would come back again. Food was good, waitress was nice. Food wasn't that expensive. $35 for a filling sit down lunch/dinner for 2 people wasn't bad.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Solid place for Empanadas! Came here around 12PM on a Saturday with my one friend who frequents this place. It was pretty empty around this time, but she said it's generally packed at night. When we say down, I noticed my plate was a bit dirty, and there was something in my water. However, the waiter quickly replace those things and we were good to go again.

We started off with some mimosas - which tasted like they were made from freshly squeezed orange juice. My friend also recommended the sangria, which she explained was ""delicious and super strong"", but we just stuck with mimosas.

We ordered 5 Empanadas to share - which I felt like was more than enough for two people. Of those, my favorite was definitely the Hawaiian. It doesn't really taste like you would think - instead it tastes like a baked apple pie.

The Cuban was also really good, and the viagra was delicious as well. I don't remember the other ones we ordered, but those were the memorable ones.

Overall, I had a great experience. The empanadas were delicious and service was quick. I also ended up ordering a few more empanadas to-go, which only took about an extra 5 minute wait.

I have never seen so many different kinds of empanadas.
We only ordered the empanadas so can review any of their other food, but it was really good. They come in little paper sleeves with labels on them. Freshly cooked and so crispy. Just watch out it's hot.
The viagra (seafood) was the best. The beef one was good too.
I recommend the flour ones more than the corn ones as they have a harder shell and break apart more.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,Best empanadas I've had in NYC. Bursting with flavor. Fresh and juicy and crispy crunchy. The plump beauties are literally bulging with top quality ingredients. Big risk of over-eating. The chicken arepa is also fantastic. While I know it's enough for two I often eat it all myself. Get a salad or some Yucca fries to help pace yourself or you might do what I did today.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"This is one of the very few places I hold dearly. I have been a loyal patron since '07, long before I married and had a kid. No matter how narrow and tight the space was, always found a way to either wait for a table or do a take-out, drunk or sober.

Always been a big fan of the wheat flour empanadas: viagra, spinach and cheese, cheeseburger, pizza, and brasil. For dine-in, we usually had the yuca fries or the plantain chips as a starter and the salpicon to drink. I miss those days when the empanadas were only 2.75 each, now that price has doubled. Understandable though, rent has skyrocketed these past years. I personally haven't gone to this place cos I have been going to the LES location lately which is much closer to me.

But, I still love this location. No matter who I bring here, the food is memorable enough for them that whenever they visit me, they come looking for these empanadas hahah.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Their spicy chicken empanada is one of my favorites, but my absolute must get is their spicy guac and plantain chips. Sometimes, when I'm feeling a liiittle more carby, I go for the yucca fries too. Two empanadas and the guac to share? Perfect for dinner - or a late night drunk snack.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"This is sadly a long overdue review from our trip to NY in March. We got recommendations from my boyfriend's coworkers to give this place a try, so we stopped by before our ferry tour around NY landmarks (so touristy...I know). This place was so bomb that we ended up stopping by again AFTER our tour to grab more to eat in our hotel room!!

I think we tried a couple of different empanadas total: desayuno colombiano, spinach & cheese, brazil, viagra (seafood), mac & cheese. My favorite had to be the Desayuno Colombiano, which is made of sausage and lots of cheese - perfect as a morning snack! Although I didn't feel too hot on the ferry tour, due to some surprise seasickness, I still managed to finish eating the empanadas LOL. That's how amazing they were. They are so fresh and crispy out of the oven, just fills your body with warm and fuzziness. It hit the spot in the freezing NY morning. My boyfriend really liked the Viagra one, since he's a huge fan of seafood and I believe that's one of their few seafood offerings. Honestly, all of them were really delicious, but I think the ones with meat win by MILES. They're all really well-made with the perfectly golden crust and delicious fillings inside - never skimping with what they got!

If we had more days in NY, we would definitely keep coming here for breakfast...even for mid-day/midnight snacks. So delicious and probably one of my favorite light meals while on our trip! :)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"It was not bad at all - let me be clear. I'd simply like to enlighten the wannabe hipsters around the are on what's Colombian food and darling, this is not it. It tastes nothing like authentic or not even what one gets in Queens, N.Y.

It's, however, a descent interpretation of Colombian food. One could say, it's like eating ""Mexican"" food in the U.S vs. Michoacan. Or eating ""Chinese"" food, also in the U.S, versus Sichuan. It's as authentic as the Chinese food takeout box (which was imported from the far and mysterious lands of Chicago!)

Explore, kids! Venture outside your comfort zone and truly discover foreign food

So, what do I recommend? Definitely drink the hot chocolate for it was decently close to the real thing.  Savor tamales and empanadas and while you eat remember, you could be eating the real thing for $70 less.

The drink specials aren't the same as the Happy Hour prices but are still better than the regular prices.  We went on a Tuesday and had the sangria for $7.  The sangria had good flavor and plenty of fruit in it.  It even came with a spoon for the fruit.  The empanadas are only $4 and they have such a huge variety, there's something for everyone.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"I absolutely LOVE their wheat empanada's! Especially the pizza one. It reminds of the hot pockets I used to have back in the day with a mix of pepperoni / mozzarella and marinara oozing out, only 10x better because of the crunchy shell they use here vs the soggy hot pocket I used to microwave.

There was once I ordered and they delivered a seafood empanada instead of pepperoni. -1 star for that.

I was too hungry and scarfed it down anyway but what if I was allergic to seafood? Tasty but not what I ordered.

I also really like their chicken soup other than the price. For $12 I should be getting a larger container, not the small pint sized one. Flavor and tender chicken in the soup are second to none!

I came back to try some more empanadas and this time I tried the reggaeton, Viagra(seafood) , desayuno and shredded chicken. They were all very yummy the reggaeton was my favorite. They sold out of Mac cheese so I will be back to try that I heard it's one of the top ones. Also the only thing I would say the corn empanadas were a bit too hard for my liking maybe it was because it was late at night but it was not soft at all.

Pernil -- a good amount of tasty swine..yesyesyesyes
Viagra -- seafood special when i say the seafood was tender succulent and divine.
Jerk & Cheese -- this was a great idea and you can even make it a bit more spicy add 1 extra habanero !!lls
The shredded chicken -- has good flavor but it was a lil dry to me. not saying I wouldn't get it again:-) lol

It took me a while, but I settled on the Jerk Chicken and the shredded chicken. They were soooooo good that I couldn't even take a picture before I started biting into it!

I love the versatility of the menu at this spot! You're able to come for a small bite, a heavier meal or just drinks.

They offer delivery and pick up service and sit on a first come, first serve basis upon arrival. The staff has always been extremely attentive and friendly.

During Christmas they offered Coquito as a special drink which was great and for warmer weather they have frozen margaritas & believe me they're strong!

I try to order something new every time i go but a must is definitely the guacamole, and if you like steak anything with is is great.

When it comes to the empanadas I really like a simple cheese one, any others I've tried are a hit or miss so I prefer other options :)",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Best food around the area! Highly recommend the Hawaiian and Cuban Empanadas. Their soups are great too. The sancocho especially! Also, their lento soup is great.

The customer is good and very helpful. One thing, the place gets PACKED and busy so try to go on a time when it's not. But even when it's busy, it's not bad at all.

All of them felt spot on and true to their name. My favourite was the Reggaeton while my partner's favourite was the Buffalo Chicken. We went for the wheat option, but they also do cornflour and they have veggie and seafood options too!

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Churros crispy but heavy. Not a flaky inside. Great dipping sauce. Solid cocoa

Brasil
Toro
Taste the wine. Most tender meat

Green sauce

Out of order

So I first had food from here at a work lunch. And after you need to try it I really wanted to visit the actual restaurant so I can choose my own options. I was going to see a show on Broadway and needed something quick to eat. I went to the bar and served very quickly. they took my order and my food came out pretty rapidly. My only complaint was they brought the dessert out before my actual entree. Otherwise the food was really good. So I got three different empanadas. The Brasil, the Toro, and El bandito. When you get an order it comes with two sauces. A red one which is spicier. And a green one that just adds a little more avocado and cilantro flavor. I was definitely a bigger fan of the green sauce. all three of the empanadas I got were unique and had positive things to contribute. The toro was a little bit more expensive probably because of the oxtail but also it was the most tender of all the different meats. You definitely got the flavors from the red wine that it was cooked in. The bandito was made with mole. I didn't quite get the spicy sweet combo that had been pitched to me but it was definitely very good. And the Brasil was probably the closest to a you'd expect in a typical empanada. And it was delicious. A nice mix of flavors and even though it was just a standard with chopped beef meat in there it was seasoned really well cooked wonderfully. None of the items were too greasy and had a perfect amount of crunch. I was going to get one of the dessert churros but the waitress told me that there was a churro special where you get hot chocolate and two churros so I decided to go with that. The churros were pretty good, but not my favorite. They were wonderfully crispy with the perfect amount of cinnamon sugar on them. however the insides were a little bit dense and I prefer a crispy churro all the way through. The caramel dipping sauce was delicious and went very well with the churros. I even had some leftovers that I mixed into my hot cocoa. The hot chocolate was also good. It wasn't her shattering it anyway, but it was a solid cup of hot chocolate. The whipped cream and the chocolate on top are also a nice touch that helps cool off what was served as a very hot cup of chocolate. Don't be confused because it's served with churros. It is not traditional dipping chocolate but the normal hot chocolate we see here in the states.definitely would want to come back to try their other options. The breakfast empanadas, the dessert empanadas and all of the other flavors of meat that they have",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Always a great choice for delivery. I have never been to the actual location but can't get enough of their empanadas.

The jerk and cheese is my favorite. A traditional corn flour empanada with plenty of flavor and a crunch to die for. Each bite has plenty of jerk chicken and cheese. I usually accompany it with the Mac and cheese empanada. It has bits of bacon, which compliments the  cheese very well.

The Story:
I got to enjoy Empanada Mama for National Intern Day at my office - and it was the perfect surprise! They set out a variety of empanada types and flavors, and I could immediately tell that their selections catered to everyone. They had options in pork, chicken, and cheese - on top of this they had a strong selection of gluten-free options. They also provided us with plantain chips, caesar salad, and a tray of black beans and rice.

I chose a chicken empanada and a spicy option, as well as plantain chips, rice, and caesar salad. The meal was definitely flavorful, and the spicy empanada lived up to its name. The salad was delicious as well - not too creamy and balanced out the spiciness of the empanada.

This was a treat to remember and a great way to celebrate our interns. I sincerely hope we have Empanada Mama again to cater a meal, and I highly recommend other offices or parties do the same.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Ordered empanadas for delivery with my coworkers and they were so good! Not to take anything away from the Brasil, which was already delicious in and of itself, but the Cuban was seriously divine. The empanadas come with a green and a red sauce, with the green being similar to Pio Pio's Peruvian green sauce, and the red being your typical hot sauce. Both were amazing and I would definitely buy a whole bottle of each just to drizzle on everything. In addition to their expansive menu of empanadas, they also have other Latin-style foods as well so there's definitely something for everyone. Honestly the only negative is that it's so hard to choose which empanadas to get since they all sound mouthwatering.

Although, the space is bigger  larger now, it seems very busy and the service does not feel the same, it is not bad but it does feel rushed. The empanadas are still very good. The guacamole is still on point. I think you are better off taking your meal to go. I always get the pizza empanada, the beef burger & Philly cheesesteak, & guac & chips. They only offer one set of sauces for the table you have to request extra.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"A review for office lunch delivery in addition to my previous reviews of the actual brick and mortar place itself.

Received the empanadas still warm and fragrant, perfect for a Wednesday lunch. The bewitching aromas were distracting everyone in the office.

Ordered almost everything on the menu. Highlights to try: viagra, pizza, pernil, chorizo, spinach and cheese, cheeseburger.

Viagra (shrimp + crab meat with delicious sauce), chorizo (cornflour empanada with ground pork sausage with herbs and spices), and Pernil (marinated pork slowly roasted to perfection) were my favorites. Very juicy and unique. Definitely try them. Also get the pesto sauce. It's refreshing and well-seasoned, will definitely add to your empanada experience.

A word of caution: after three empanadas, you're stuffed. And that fullness lasts the entire day because you've just consumed the heaviest meal possible--dough with meat/protein. Make sure you don't have major dinner plans after your Empanada Mama feast.

Churros with chocolate and caramel were perfect. Not the typical crunchy churros but soft and delicate. Not too sweet--just right. Really enjoyed them with caramel and thick chocolate for dipping. I'm a fan of churros, and tasted countless options. These are unique--definitely recommend.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

The food was tasty though. You only need one empanada (yes it's small but filling. I got the mushroom. My mom got the reggae one and didnt like it)

The plantains and chips and dips can definitely be shares by two people. At the very least they are generous with the portions for this.

We arrived at 7:30 and were seated immediately (between an awkward couple having a first date and a pair of elderly ladies catching up, if you want to get a sense of the diverse clientele here). The music was a bit loud (so made it a bit difficult to hear), but the atmosphere was fun and the service was really quick. Our waiter helped us pick between the long variety of options.

We each ordered 3 empanadas (they come out in little parchment bags with the name of the empanada on it), and we definitely could have done with 2 each. The green sauce on the table was very spicy (beware!) and the red sauce was great. My favorite was the cuban and the spicy chicken (which I think is one of their best sellers).

I got the viagra, spicy chicken, and reggaeton. All three did have wonderfully light, flaky, delicious exteriors. As for the fillings, the viagra was really good, and well stacked with lots of seafood. It had that wonderful, light, savory shellfish taste and a good level of moisture. The other two I was less crazy about. The reggaeton was a little dry and didn't blow me away flavor-wise. The spicy chicken was nice and spicy, but very one-note in its spiciness and made me regret not getting shredded chicken.

Now that it's back, I try to stop in whenever I'm in the area, really delicious empanadas!

We decided to visit Empanada Mama for a quick bite after a painting activity in the city. We were starving so this was exactly what we needed to hit the spot. The restaurant itself is much nicer and larger than the old one I originally visited. It has a fun, casual and relaxed vibe where you can go for a quick drink and empanadas. The bartender and staff were very friendly and helpful.

Now that I'm vegetarian, the options have certainly decreased significantly since I originally visited but there are still a couple options to choose from. My go to is the Oven-Baked Greek Spinach Pie (Classic Greek Style with Spinach and Feta Cheese) ($3.85). I also tried the new Eggplant Parmasean empanada but that was a bit disappointing. We also ordered the Guacamole with Plaintain Chips (~$12) which was absolutely delicious and one of the best guacamole I have tried.

Tip: The sauce makes the meal--opt/ ask for the Chipotle Mayo. It's delicious and I prefer it over the green and brown sauces!

I honestly can't say which one is my favorite, but my top 3 would have to be the spinach and cheese, the macaroni and cheese and the barbecue 1 in the corn flour coating. Service is fast and friendly, but don't expect any frills.   They also seem to have a very heavy takeout and delivery service because apparently I am not the only one who thinks these are fantastic!

The empanadas were pretty good, just a little bit dry (maybe I am biased having a grandmother who makes homemade Ecuadorian empanadas, I will admit that). They had a lot of flavors so it's almost impossible to not find something that interested you.

The plaintain chips were delicious! Not too salty or oily. The arepa was the perfect amount of sweet.

The only thing I had a problem with was that they told me at the front desk that they could bake the corn empanadas in the oven which are gluten free no problem. When we sat down the server had a different story and refused to even try. My boyfriend who has celiac had to take the risk of dealing with cross contamination since the corn ones went in the same fryer. I understand if they can't do it, but why would the front desk tell me yes? And then the waiter wouldn't even ask the kitchen for us.

We ordered a pitcher of frozen margarita to split between three total people and we each ordered three empanadas. We each got about two servings of margaritas from the pitcher.

I took my wife on Saturday at 9:00pm and ordered different empanadas from Friday. Again, they were SO good. I'm not gonna include which ones I ordered because I'm convinced that they are all delicious.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Each time I travel to NYC, I have the same dilemma: try one of the hundreds of delicious restaurants I have not yet discovered, or return to somewhere I've enjoyed before... and almost every time, I wind up back at Empanada Mama for some delicious, cheap eats. This location has remodeled and expanded since I first discovered it, which has been a great improvement in the physical space with the same tasty empanadas I've come to love. Service was quick and friendly.

Most recently, I had some time to kill in NYC and was absolutely starving, so wandered in to Empanada Mama around 11 AM on a Sunday. I was nervous there would be a long wait, but surprisingly, was able to be seated immediately. I ordered two empanadas, which was the perfect amount to feel relatively full without having to forcefeed myself (though honestly, it'd be 100% worth it to order more). I tried the Desayuna Columbiana (with sausage, egg, and cheese) and ordered an old staple of seasoned chicken. I enjoyed both with the green sauce that automatically comes with any order --- perfection, all for just around $10.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Sunday at 1:30pm this place was packed! We didn't wait very long for 2 people. The service was painfully slow. After being seated I think the waiter had forgotten about us and never gave us the menu. Awkwardly.. we grabbed some from the counter ourselves.

We ordered:
- Empanadas (reggaeton, corn viagra, spicy chicken): These did not disappoint! They came hot and crisp. My favorite was the viagra. The reggaeton and spicy chicken was packed with flavor but too dry. The sauce they provided really complimented them.

- Columbian chicken soup: $9 for a cup size is kind of steep. I also don't understand why it took over an hour to arrive. The soup was good but way too salty for my taste.

- Guacamole with fried plaintains: Good but not the best. I reccomend it if you like your guac really sour and pureed texture. It felt as if they pre-made bulk and left it in the fridge. But I could be wrong.

Overall I thought my meal was good. With the exception that I the amount of sodium was insane. I drank so many cups of water. I'd return to try other empanadas.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,Returned again and once again disappointed! Received a Luke warm cheese steak empanada that was soggy and obviously not freshly fried. Come on empanada stop with your bad quality of serving food and go back to the way it was years ago before the other one burned down. Few months ago I ordered sancocho de cola and the meat was frozen. I keep returning because I love this restaurant and have been a customer for years! Other than that the service is excellent and the staff there is very nice.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Their empanadas are delicious! My favorite is the viagra which has shrimp, scallop, and crab stew inside. I've also tried the Desayuno Columbiano, spicy chicken, and the Cuban which I'd also recommend. The first time I came here was to grab a quick snack to go and the second time was to dine in. This place definitely gets packed during dinner time on a Saturday so be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes to get seated.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"If you love seafood and empanadas, then you MUST try the Viagra Empanadas! I loved the ambiance and the sweet manager, Robert. The only reason I'm giving this joint 4 stars if because of the waiter who worked on Dec 25, 2019 during 1-2am. I don't know his name, and would not want to call him out. Still, he had a passive aggressive, uninviting attitude towards me and my family. Also, he spilled water in the chair next to mine which had my digital camera. All he did was say, ""sorry"" and walked away... didn't even bother to bring a rag or extra napkins to clean the water spilled on my camera.

Empanada Mama is Columbian and the handsome servers (all in black)  made me remember the first and few Columbians that I new as a child in Queens, the Perez family. I don't recall ever sharing a meal along their home but this experience may come close. The food was delicious: Chorizo, ground veef, and veggie empanadas. They were perfectly shaped as half moons (maybe too much sobthat I wondered if they were hand-made).

Service - AMAZING! The guys were super friendly and made sure I was taken care of right away.
Food- BOMB!! so good that I had actually came back and ordered some to take back to Cali.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"The Quick: Loved the old location, and I'm now obsessed with the new location. Delicious empanadas, great sangria, overall fun vibe, and plenty of seating. Great at any time but phenomenal for late night eating when you don't want the party to end!

The Details: sober or drunk this place is great! Everything I've had has always been tasty, and the vibe is always on point. Not sure if people come to start the party or on the party, but either way this place is fun.

The Damage: $3-$4 an empanada plus plenty of entrees and sides available too",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"EVERYTHING about this location was a treat. The margaritas were strong and delicious, the staff was awesome, and the food was AMAZING. We sat at the bar, and enjoyed fantastic service at the bar. We had two separate bartenders named Daniel, and both were awesome. A couple of my friends were a little rowdy when we came in, and both our bartender and the manager did a dynamite job keeping an eye on him but letting us have our fun at the same time.

Now, the most important part - the EMPANADAS!!! I tried a few variations, and found that they were all delicious. The basic, tried-and-true filled with cheese was perfection, the Cuban was a nice twist, and there was a BBQ one that (while not my personal favorite), still delicious. I love that you can mix and match whatever ones sound good that day. I would recommend ordered 2-3 for a full meal per person.

They've redone this space, and it looks a million times better. The bright green walls really liven it up, and the layout is much less cramped/claustrophobic. Highly recommend you stop by and have a drink (or three) and an empanada anytime you're looking for a relatively cheap buzz and meal.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,Got take out here 2 times. Both times it was fast and the food was hot. Tried a few different empanadas with my favorite being the buffalo. Also got a Cuban both times. It was very good but slightly different than a traditional Cuban. They put their own sauce on it which gives it a nice flavor and a little spice. Will order takeout from here again,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,This is a favorite stop when we are in NYC.  It's cheap and fantastic! Fun vibe and the empanadas are to die for!  Our favorites are the Cuban and cheesesteak.

Seems like a locals kind of place.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Food was so good I forgot to take more pictures!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Not a place for salad! My friend and I walked-in and ordered take-out. She ordered three empanadas, and I ordered a coco salad with grilled chicken. We practically ordered at the same time. But I waited at least 10 more minutes. And when I got home and finally tried to enjoy late dinner, I realized that most of the grilled chicken was not fully cooked (see pic), and I found a rubber band in the salad (see pic as well)!

It was my first time eating here, so I cannot say for other things. I tried my friend's empanadas, and they were pretty good. So I can only say that I am very disappointed about the salad. It was not a cheap salad ($18 in total), but I definitely expected more out of this.

Don't go there for salads! Stick with empanadas.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"To start off, this place is opened 24/7 and seems to almost always be busy. Last Saturday was my first time here. Though they were packed, there was no wait for a table, something almost unheard of, especially when it's nice out!

We started our meal off with the Yucca Frita & Plantain Chips and the Mozzarepa. Both dishes were amazing, the Yucca Fries being the favorite! For our main course, of course we had to order some empanadas! We had the Desayuno Colombiano, Hawaiian, Cheeseburger, and the Jerk N' Cheese. Again, all were amazing and were the perfect size.

The overall restaurant is very cute, clean, and the service was great. Wait time for the food wasn't too long either. I can't wait to go back, I'm craving the Fries!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Ok so this is my 1st visit back here since the fire and wow this place looks ten times better than before!!! Way more space and the space is brighter and cheerful. They even have a bar area and a small waiting area for pickup.

Staff was super friendly and attentive!

No lines! WOW! Maybe cuz it was the eve of Christmas Eve. I dunno but it was a good experience!

You can get more than empanadas here but I only come for empanadas because they are that good! There is a large selection of empanadas. It's more of a Puerto Rican type empanada. Not Colombian.
The typical most common beef empanada is called the ""Brazil""for some reason.  But the best empanada here is the Viagra which is a seafood stew and it's amazing. Never had it anywhere else except this place. So delish. The spicy chicken is another favorite. Reggaton is good too.

I didnt have sangria here this time. But I've had in the past and at the other location as well and it's pretty solid.

Each empanada is $3.75 unless you get a viagra and that's $3.95.  Two can fill you up but it depends on your hunger level . I've down 4 before lol

Comes with two sauces on the side - a red hot sauce and a green mild sauce . I love both . I tend to but the red on all of them except the viagra in which I love the green with that one!

If you are in midtown ... near the broadway area or hells kitchen - make a pit stop here .

Empanadas are LIFE :)

Corn flour empanadas are fried, but look and taste like they're baked, and leave you with no greasy after taste. Cheese & broccoli is really good, and can be the best alternative to meat for vegetarians.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Ordered off the new menu of new additions of empanadas. I got the buffalo chicken. For some reason it tasted really bad. So I asked the kind waiter for an exchange for a plain chicken wheat empanada. He asked the manager and the MANAGER KATERINA ! Said no we don't do
EXCHANGES. HAHAHA
KATERINA has some nerve serving me something so gross and not allowing me to exchange a $3.85 empanada.
I have been coming to the Hell's Kitchen location since then were just a small restaurant. And I am so taken back by the bad service.
Because of the MANAGER KATERINA, I will no longer come this to this location.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Online ordering service was not easy or working properly - I had to go through the online order form and call the restaurant twice to confirm the order and give them my credit card info.

The delivery was estimated to take ~30-45 minutes, but ended up being 15-20 minutes late (on top of the 45 mins). The place I'm staying at is literally around the corner. To say the least, they weren't hot or warm anymore.

The empanadas are pretty pricey at $4 a pop, but read all the wonderful reviews so decided I had to try them out while visiting. They are tiny for $4.

I had the Wheat Flour - Korean BBQ, Corn Flour - Shredded Chicken, and the Oven Baked - Greek Sausage Pie. They all tasted alright. None of them stood out. The real winner though was the green salsa.

Overall, it was a disappointment, except the salsa.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Empanadas are like Spanish jiao zi (Chinese dumplings) and I DIG IT. My sister and I dropped in to Empanada Mama on a late summer evening and I was immediately captivated by its fun, colorful, warm atmosphere. We were quickly seated and served with an impressive menu of flour, wheat, and corn empanadas galore. There were a ton of flavors to choose from, including some fusion options like Korean BBQ! I got the Spinach/Cheese and Viagra Empanada (seafood) with a sangria and it was so damn tasty. The empanadas were fried and flavorful but far from being heavy or salty and the drink was quite strong. We ended our meal with one of the dessert empanadas which was also pretty good. Portion-wise, what I got was definitely on the light dinner side. No worries if you're worried about getting enough food because you can always order more and service is super fast!

Overall, def a must if you're heading to Hell's Kitchen. Empanada Mama is a great place to hit up before a night out on the 9th or, if you're a tourist like me, wandering to Times Square to see all the lights at night.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

A seat was available immediately. The place has a relaxed vibe, low key. They have a whole selection of wheat and corn based empanadas as well as other entrees, salads, breakfast dishes, etc. The plantain chips with guac we had as an appetizer was amazing. As for the empanadas, it was so hard for me to pick among the selections, which is saying a lot because I'm a vegetarian! I ended up getting the rice and bean and pizza empanadas. The rice and beans was OK, but the pizza was AMAZING. I can't believe how much food you can get for so cheap. Highly recommend.

Having heard marvelous things, we were determined to get at least two empanadas each... and we also ordered the yuca fries. The fries were warm and loaded with toppings... prbly should have skipped these as we tend to get full really easily, but they were quite good. My husband ordered the spinach & cheese and the spicy chicken- noting, between mouthfuls, that each one was delicious, the chicken more so than the spinach & cheese. I ordered the spicy chicken, and per recommendation of our server, the viagra (yes, I giggled at the name). I'll admit, while viagra is seemingly a fab favorite, it was a little too fishy for me, so I preferred the spicy chicken. The best part of it all was the sauce!!

Waiter never came by to ask if we needed anything.  Flagged down another waiter to ask for another drink - it finally came 20 minutes later, after I had already finished my meal.

I feel like we were in really good hands the entire night, and the yucca chips appetizer with our empanadas were an amazing touch to our first real night in New York. The empanadas here are so flavorful and heavy, well worth the steep price honestly.

As far as ambience, the music they played was very good and the place was packed so we knew this was clearly a popular place in the area. We ended up going to their location the next night out at 5am (they are open 24/7) for drunchies after the club and we're even happier.

The food is absolutely delicious and they have some great choices.  The spicy guacamole & plantain chips is a great way to start the meal.  And their Happy Hour/Daily Specials are a great deal, (on Monday you can get $5 margaritas!)

The empanadas are the centerpiece of this establishment.  They have some amazing choices, and they have something for everyone!

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"When the best thing in the bag was the green sauce......

I mean...since I didn't pay for the meal, and they offer a good size/properly filled/non-greasy empanada for the price, I really wanted to make it 2.5 rounded up.  However, gotta round down, even with not having paid.

Good delivery time.  And I really wanted to like them (who doesn't want to like an empanada?!).  But I worked through (all wheat) Viagra, El Bandito, and Desayuno...and the only one I'd be down to eat again is Desayuno...and that even had some chewy meat in it.  El Bandito wouldn't pair well with the AWESOME creamy green sauce, since the spice profile is really heavy on cloves (overpowered the entire thing).

I also ordered a side of rice and beans.  Asked for yellow rice; got white...really overcooked, soggy white rice.  And, again, one flavoring thing overpowered the dish (bay leaves left in way too long in the cooking of the beans - had a co-worker try...she agreed).  $7 for a pint of rice & beans neither of us wanted to finish?

I got 2 chicken empanadas in corn flour.  They were huge!  And incredibly delicious.  Also got a side of plantain chips and yucca fries, which awesomely came with guacamole.  They were sooooo good.  The yucca fries actually tasted like yucca fries -- not perfect, but pretty good.  I'm aware how difficult it is to make yucca fries and most places fail miserably, but these were legit good.

Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"I've been holding off on writing this review until my empanada kick ended, but I've literally had empanadas 17 times in the last 30 business days so here we go. I've only ordered delivery from Empanada Mama but I've been pretty pleasantly surprised at how hot they arrive to me, even though I know that I'm pretty far away from their store.

I'm a fan of both their chicken/wheat empanadas and they're slightly spicy mostly savory green sauce. I'm not a huge fan of the mozzarella empanadas because I find that half the time the cheese cools too much on the way over so I have a half empty empanada.  I wasn't really into the jerk and cheese empanada, but I can't tell you that the spicy chicken is slap your mother hot-- they are not joking when they say that it's intense.

The only reason that I'm not ordering them for lunch tomorrow is that I'm pretty sure I have to have some kind a variety in my diet or I will actually become an empanada.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"The very first time I went to Empanada Mama was a few months ago and it was at the Astoria location.  The empanadas surprisingly blew me away.  The Astoria location is more of a self serve/no waiter service restaurant, which was fine.  This newly renovated location on 9th Ave is waiter service...with alcohol!  Beautifully decorated; great atmosphere although a little loud when it gets crowded.  BUT...fantastic empanadas!  The variety is mind blowing!  The hard part is which empanada to pick.

During this visit, we decided to order the tostones side dish ($7.75). We were expecting the traditional thick, smashed pieces of green plantain but instead got thin wafer like tostones.  They were pretty good, but just not what we were expecting.

We also shared a bunch of empanadas:
Viagra.....a must have!  Full of seafood goodness!
Cubano....really good but I really didn't taste any pickles or mustard in it.
Greek Spinach Pie....really great....it actually tasted like Greek spinach pie!
Rueben...good but better with a tad bit more sauerkraut.
Polish...good and this one had enough sauerkraut! lol

Next time, I'm going to try their sancocho.....yummm!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants
Empanada Mama - Hell's Kitchen,"Holy Viagra! I'm so happy I tried the empanadas here. Luckily they are open 24 hours so I was able to satisfy my late night empanada cravings.  You can also order alcohol until 4 am so that's a plus.  We stopped by around 3:45 am and was seated promptly. There were several open tables at this point but by the end of our meal the place filled up quickly.

We started with that chicharrones which are not your typical fried pork rinds. These were thick cut pork belly slices fried up and served on top of tostones. Yummy and so good with the green sauce!  We also tried the shredded beef arepas which were a bit dry for my liking but still tasty.

We also ordered several empanadas to start with: The Cuban, spicy chicken, Reggaeton, Mambo Italiano, and the Viagra.  I probably made the mistake of trying the Viagra first, which ruined it for all the other empanadas after it. Wow, the shrimp, scallops, and crabmeat were meaty and juicy and it was like no other empanada I've ever had, and I've had my fair share of empanadas.  It was truly love at first bite. All the other empanadas were delicious, but the Viagra was my absolute favorite! I even ordered two more because I just couldn't get enough. The green sauce was also so yummy I just wanted to drink it up!

Upon until the lockdown, this was our go to place when we wanted a quick pasta fix lol The prices are reasonable, the staff members are friendly, service is quick and the food is really good. They also serve beer and wine. If you order a pasta with a glass of wine, the meal comes out to $16 (I usually order this special lol)

One quick tip, if you're a slow eater like myself and you decide to order an appetizer or a salad before your pasta, make sure you tell the servers not to bring the whole order together. Everything is delicious, but I like to space out my meals lol.

I can't wait to go back once the virus lockdown is over. I've always had a great experience when I go to this restaurant. It's perfect for low key nights when you still want to splurge a little on wine and pasta :)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/empanada-mama-hells-kitchen-new-york?osq=restaurants

Forma Pasta Factory,Ordered tonight for a quarantine pasta fix. So fast and so good! And contactless drop off for those that are worried about that.  Got the seafood linguine and the fettuccine funghj as well as the eggplant parm and arancini (yum!!). Would order it all again. Really good stuff. They threw in some focaccia too which was also delicious.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"In your face!

All the pasta options were quickly prepared in an open kitchen right next to the ordering station.  Pretty much all the cooking is done right in front with nothing to hide.

All the pasta entrees I've tried were fantastic, the Bolognese, Seafood Pasta, Spaghetti with Meatballs and Tagleitelle with Shrimp were all really delicious.  The fresh pasta is definitely the draw as the portions of the accompaniments to the fresh pasta may not be as generous but they are indeed fresh.  They also have specialities on certain days, like for example the Thursday Frutti Di Marie Pasta is awesome and a definite order.  

The appetizers on the whole were ok.  The one bite sized Arancini bites were really good.  The Eggplant appetizer was ok but definitely need a knife to cut up through the tough skin of the eggplant.

The staff here are super friendly and care about your satisfaction.  Forma Pasta Factory presents a good fresh meal at a reasonable cost.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"I ordered tagliatelle scampi,which is pasta with butter lemon and shrimp and garlic breadcrumbs. Not sure where was butter or lemon,but I definitely felt a taste of garlic and lots of oil. Not garlic breadcrumbs,but specifically garlic. Never seen that much garlic in pasta. Corona season is corona season,but I definitely don't need extra ""protection "" with extra garlic. Very disappointed.
Would be 1 star,but at least there was shrimps ‍‍‍

Forma Pasta Factory,"PURCHASED: Spaghetti Pomodoro
TOTAL: $11.00

PROS:
+ Watch them make it: You can watch Mamadi one of the sous chefs whip together fine pastas in a matter of minutes. He recommends the Pappardelle Bolognese or the Spaghetti Pomodoro. I had the Spaghetti Pomodoro (read below).

+ Spaghetti Pomodoro: No joke--I've never been overly excited about Italian cuisines until I arrived here. Growing up, I've made subpar spaghetti w/ pasta and tomato sauce purchased from an aisle of the local supermarket. THIS was entirely different. The noodles were el dente and the red sauce was... just.. I just can't describe it because I've never had spaghetti sauce like this. This is probably the closest I've had to Italian cuisine. No f-ing joke, each bite was to savor.

+ Friendly staff: I was offered a phone charger to call friends.

+ Excellent working W.C.: Clean, clean, clean! And, there are 2 coat hangers! The owner really thought this through. This makes such a huge difference in any place that you may go to. There's a cute little statue of a English Bull Dog in the corner.

+ vegetarian-friendly: There are plenty--I mean like 5+ dishes that were for vegetarian. They all looked good too. (Of note, I am a meat eater--trying to change).

+ pay before: You pay, they cook and serve. You leave without having to deal with the bill or splitting it with your friends. Very efficient.

CONS:
NONE--that's rare for me.

IMPRESSION :
This place deserves a full 5-star rating. I was thoroughly impressed with not only the food, but the dining experience. And, I could not believe it was only $11. I love this place because the Spaghetti Pomodoro is so good and AFFORDABLE! Jesus--I am coming back despite COVID-19 (semi-kidding--please wash your hands for 20 seconds and stay away from people!) This has to be a new favorite in 2020, if we make it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"The ambience slightly reminds me of Xian famous foods or Panera, expect with pasta. You go to the register to  order your food, they bring it to you, you eat and then you dumb the dishes in the cleaning bucket to get cleaned. Not a terrible idea. It's a pretty small establishment, so you better off going with a small group no bigger than 5. That is the only reason I'll give it 4 star because of seating other than that the food is awesome.

Now let's talk about the pasta. My wife and I both ordered the the gem salad and fettuccine funghi. The gem salad was delicious. Baby mixed lettuce, lemon mostarda vinaigrette and shaved pecorino Romano cheese make for an delicious taste. It made an excellent appetizer; after I had the fettuccine fungi, which is basically sautéed wild mushroom sauce, thyme and rosemary and parmigiano reggiano. The creamy mushroom sauce makes the fettuccine divine. It didn't take me long to finish, I literally wiped my plate clean. We both enjoyed the pasta and I will return.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"After hearing from a friend about Forma Pasta Factory, I decided to give it a try for lunch. I ordered the fettuccine funghi and sat at the ""bar"" and had the delight of watching the staff cook right in front of me! The dish was rich and flavorful and I had bread to soak up the remaining sauce with once I finished my meal. And the best part? This extremely filling meal was only $12 after tax!

One of the chefs, Amit, talked to me while I ate and provided great customer service and conversation. I really enjoyed seeing him cook while talking to him. I had a few hours to kill before a commitment that evening and Amit was gracious enough to let me stay at the bar and work on my computer for several hours! I also got a coffee after my meal which really hit the spot.

All in all, Forma has excellent, affordable food with a staff that goes above and beyond to make every customer feel welcome. I would definitely recommend for a date night or just a casual outing with friends.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

One of my favorites in SF was Italian Homemade where I could get a cheap plate of homemade pasta and I did not think I would find a place like that in nyc.  But there is one and it's in Brooklyn.

Forma Pasta Factory,"Forma Pasta Factory is awesome. If you're like me who doesn't eat pasta on a weekly basis because you're not always into the fancy formal dine in or you didn't want to spend $20+ on a pasta dish, you're in luck because Forma Pasta fixes that.

It's like Xian famous foods in that you get fresh noods that's delicious and it's relatively inexpensive.

$5 Arancini were good. Freshly fried and a generous amount to your order.

$5 meatballs were a terrific deal. They were moist and the sauce was excellent.

The pappardelle bolognese was good. Meaty and hearty.

The tagliatelle scampi with shrimp was okay. Smokey shrimp flavor with a hint of lemon and butter. Since we opted for the gluten free pasta on this one, I didn't get the max effect but still good.

Forma Pasta Factory,"A friend and I went in after reading all these raving reviews. We had the Fetuccini Funghi and Tagliatelle Scampi - both were delicious! Very fresh and hella flavorful. I'm already thinking of when I can go back for more. 5/5 for taste.

The interior is nice and neat. The seating areas upfront are mostly bar type or high chairs with two seats per table. Towards the back there are abut 4 tables good for 3-4 people each. The restroom is also in the back. A bit too close to and directly opens to the tables which made me not want to seat there. But I sat there. It was the coziest spot. I see what they did there. huh. 5/5 for interior.

The service is very very quick and friendly. We had our two dishes and an appetizer come out within a few minutes. You order up front, grab a table and the server brings you your food. At the end of your meal, you clear your own table. For these prices and a satisfied tummy, I sure as heck did not mind taking my plates up. 5/5 for service.

P.S. I suggest you don't enter the bathroom when you're almost about to pee your pants - there's something in there as you first enter that may turn the 'almost' to an accident. *wink, wink*",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Forma Pasta Factory,"Forma Pasta Factory is a beautifully designed Italian spot located in the heart of Greenpoint offering delicious appetizers, pasta dishes, and salads. I love the fast casual concept here. Patrons can order their food in the front and grab a seat wherever, no tipping required. All their pastas are also made fresh in-house.

On my visit with my friend, we ordered the pappardelle bolognese, the tagliatelle scampi, the forma salad, and the arancini (yes we can eat). I absolutely loved both the presentation and taste of both pasta dishes. The pappardelle was simply executed with a bold and flavorful meat marinara sauce. The tagliatelle included sautéed shrimp, white wine, and a lemon butter sauce that brought all the flavors together perfectly. The forma salad was a nice lighter dish to pair with our pastas. I liked the arancini but in comparing it to my other arancini experience from Arancini Bros at Smorgasburg, this does not compare, though it was still tasty.

Cauliflowers dressed in lemon juice olive oil with crushed red peppers and chopped green onion garnish. Love it!

Forma Pasta Factory,"Pipette Ragu - 4/5
Spaghetti Pomodoro - 2/5
Cauliflower - 4/5
Hygiene - 1/5

The dishes are small by nyc standards, so don't expect to leave full! I wanted to love the sht out of this place and have been meaning to dine here for months since I grew up and live in an Italian neighborhood, I know what good Italian food tastes like.

The pipette ragu was tasty, I would've preferred my pasta to be a bit more on the softer side though.

The spaghetti pomodoro, reminded me of a slightly tastier version of chef boyardee's sauce, because it had that same level of sweetness, but had more of a flavor depth to it that I can't quite explain. The meatballs are surprisingly, freaking small, but bigger then the chef boyardee version. Personally, I wasn't fond of this dish.

Side of cauliflower that had tasty sauce, HOWEVER, and this is a huge no no and costed stars from me due to unhygienic food handling:

The person who took care of the garnishing, plated the cooked cauliflower with his bare hands, that's right, SANS gloves, and placed the garnishes on top, then served directly to me.

NYS law prohibits bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"Truly a 5 star experience in every way. This was some of the best pasta I've ever had - at at $11 for a filling portion - a complete steal.

They have around 6 or so pastas on the menu for $11 a pop and some daily specials for slightly more. A pasta & glass of wine deal will run you $16. From a value standpoint it couldn't be any better. I opted for the tagliatelle with shrimp and a glass of Albariño. Wine was just a tad sweeter than I would have preferred, but no fault of Forma's.

Place is cute on the inside and has a bunch of seating plus a couple of tables outside. Bathroom is spacious and clean. Staff was super friendly. It's counter service, but they'll bring the pasta to you, which I actually prefer because I find it less intrusive. I was asked how my meal was by the owner (?) on my way out.

All you do is order in the front, you can pick your drink from the open fridge next to the cashier and they will give you a table card with a number on it. You pick your own seat and the staff will bring your food to wherever you sit.   I do admit it gives me a fast food vibe but it does not take away from the quality of the food. The tagliatelle scampi and arancini balls are my absolute favorite. For the side, I would also go with the cauliflower. We also got one of the specials it was a gemelli with beef and bits of wild boar, almost like a ragu and it was ok, probably skip that one next time.

Fettuccine funghi is by far my favorite one! Tagliatelle scampi and pipette ragú were delicious as well. Creamy lemon sauce in the tagliatelle scampi and a rich spicy sauce for the pipette ragú.

Tried the meatball side and it wasn't bad, but I felt like the meatballs were missing something. Eggplant parmigiana side was yummy!

Overall the prices are super affordable for the high quality food that you receive. They have a Wine and Dine special for $16, don't pass up on that!

Forma Pasta Factory,"Rounding up from 3.5. Nice menu. Counter ordering. Lots of bar stools but some regular seating in the back. Vegetarian friendly. Modest size portions. Someone was making ravioli when we left.

We had the gem salad. It was fine. I had the fettuccine with funghi. It seems all white button mushrooms in a light cream sauce. Pasta itself was great, the whole dish was too salty though. As was the gemelli with pesto and blistered cherry tomatoes (that weren't blistered). We compared this to the fresh pasta we had at Misi with pesto that still seemed alive and it seriously paled. The thing I was most struck by in Italy was how tasty the food was despite being somewhat unsalted.

My wife enjoyed the veg with bagna cauda. I enjoyed the roasted cauliflower.

Good - Ravioli, Gemelli
Meh - Trofie, Eggplant parm
Skip - Lasagna (was a little too burnt for my liking, good sauce though, you can roll the dice)

Not the best pasta in the city, but very good for this price point. Depending on the day, it's a rotating pasta special.

Forma Pasta Factory,"Fresh pasta isn't for everyone, especially those who are so used to dry pasta, but if you want to give it a go, this is where you come. Parking is very easy. Just stop by anywhere on the edge of McCarren Park and take a short walk over.

Delicious food and fast service. May seem pricey, but given the area, quality of food, and freshness of ingredients, it's completely worth it. I came in with a friend in the afternoon and ordered an affogato first(weird, I know, but I was craving it), Seafood Fra Diavolo, Spaghetti Pomodoro with meatballs, and Fetuccine Funghi. Everything was cooked al dente, but you can let them know if you prefer overcooked pasta.

The fettuccine was creamy, earthy, and meshed so very well with the parmigiano reggiano. The tomato sauce of the spaghetti pomodoro was herbacious and fresh. The meatballs were good, but optional--they were fairly small in size and not as impactful as the pasta itself. And the Seafood Fra Diavolo, my favourite, didn't have the most seafood flavour, but had the most robust tomato sauce out of what I had tried.

These three entrees were more than enough for the two of us, but we fell compelled to taste even more, so we ordered a pappardelle bolognese as well as a forma salad. The baby artichoke and sweet but sour aged balsamic vinaigrette of the salad were highlights, but the pappardelle was stunning. But of course, this is completely biased, because bolognese sauce occupies a special place in my heart

Give this place a try. If I find myself in the area in queue for Five Leaves, I will 100% make a beeline to come here for appetizer. Squisito!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"Forma Pasta has a very casual ambience, serving some solid pasta dishes. Order at the counter, grab a table, and wait for the food to arrive.

The spaghetti pomodoro with meatballs was solid. It was not my first choice but due to allergies, it was one of the only dishes that I could eat. It was light and had the typical pomodoro flavours. The meatballs, however, were too small and did not add much heartiness to the dish. The cauliflower side was delicious. I just wish that I had more of it. The complimentary focaccia bread was great, and I had to ask for more. Overall, the portion size of every single thing left me wanting more because it tended toward the smaller size.

Would I come back? Probably not. Am I happy I tried it? Indeed.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"Wowsa, is this place good. Incredible! Totally blew me away.

The classic spaghetti pomodoro is the best I've had, and my favorite used to be Malatesta's. The spaghetti is homemade and al dente, but just soft enough to wrap around your fork.

The tomato sauce has the sweet, fresh tang of a top-knot Italian sauce. The pasta is sprinkled with crisp basil and drizzled with olive oil and, if you grab a seat outside, you can eat it on a sunny day. I got to eat it with my dog Gerbert and my friend!

Forma Pasta Factory,"This place is definitely a neighborhood hidden gem and we'll be back for sure. Perhaps because I want to give it a 5 star and so I will be back for a redemption dish. This rating is purely based on my experience with the food and my boyfriend could say otherwise because he seemed like he thoroughly enjoyed everything he ordered. We ordered the arancini balls which were delectable in terms of size (one-bite!), flavor, seasoning, and temperature (piping hot). We liked the chipotle-mayo-based sauce that he came with but I think the arancini balls were tasty without it also.

Bf got the parpadelle bolognese which had a very fresh tomato flavor which we both loved since we get tired of my costco tomato sauce at home sometimes. It was proportioned perfectly and had just right amount of flavorful meat.

My pasta however was slightly disappointing. I got the fettucini funghi in cream sauce and although I appreciate the HUGE proportion that it came in, the sauce was overly salty for me. Maybe it was just a slight miss for my plate but I couldn't stop drinking water with every bite. The cream sauce was packed with mushroom flavor though, don't get me wrong, it's just the high sodium amount that threw me off and kept me from cleaning the dish clean.

Did I mention that they make all their pasta fresh in house? Which is why they still get a 4 star from me - their parpadelle and fettucini had the perfect bite, cooked precisely al dente, and had that slight eggy flavor that just is amazing when coated with sauce.

Writing this review is making me hungry again. Anyways, definitely check this place out when you're in greenpoint/lic/williamsburg area.

Overall a good spot if you're on a budget and don't want cheap food (their beef is organic grass fed..) but not a place to go if you want to have a really good dinner.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,Loved the pasta dishes! Good price and good portion. Will definitely be ordering more food from here!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

i got their pappardelle bolognese & tagliatelle scampi. so so good .. those noodz were so good.

i also got the kale caesar salad & panna cotta which was pretty yummy too!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"I myself don't really like pasta, but this place for sure makes the best one!

Getting to the restaurant is easy. Right along Bedford, a few minutes away from the park. The place is quaint and cosy. The line went by pretty quick, you order, pay upfront, and seat yourself.

Pastas range from $11-14, while their combos (pasta and wine) go for $18. I ordered a side of meatballs (shared), tagliatelle scampi with rosé, and chocolate mousse. My sister tried the pappardelle bolognese with cabernet and cheesecake. Our total was ~$50.

The meatballs were good. It was soft, easy to cut, and the flavors were good. The tomato sauce it came with finished the whole appetizer. The tagliatelle scampi sauce was buttery, and the shrimp portions were enough to get me finished without having to scrap for more shrimp. The taste was very filling, although I don't like the type of pasta it was served with (it felt like never ending pasta), it was still good! Lastly my chocolate mousse was fine. I wouldn't really dig in for more, it was very thick, but  maybe because I enjoyed so much of my appetizer and main, I couldn't fit it in my stomach.

Overall, I like this restaurant. The quality, service, and price would make me come back for more!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Forma Pasta Factory,"This place is FANTASTIC! Stopped by on a whim and the staff was incredibly friendly and helped me choose my menu item since it was my first visit.

Forma Pasta Factory,"If you're looking for the world's best pasta, you won't find that here.  What you will find is very good pasta -- flavorful, nicely portioned, well cooked -- for an almost unbelievably low price given the neighborhood, and really fast, efficient service.  Definitely recommend if you're in the area.  Only concern is it looks kind of ""corporate"", like the owners are just waiting for a big expansion where they can replicate this location - and that sort of thing doesn't go over well in this part of Greenpoint, where mom and pop operations are favored.  But still, the tremendous value offered here I think will win people over.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Forma Pasta Factory,"when it comes to pasta, FORMA knows their stuff. My experience here was amazing from beginning to end. The pasta dishes were $11 each, and was cooked to perfection. They have a variety of pastas (dried and fresh) made on site that you can take home too! I loved watching the lady make the pasta lol im a ""hows stuff made..."" fan ^_^
They also have a special for each day of the week (minus Mondays when shops closed) as well as a Chef Special on the board.
You cannot go wrong with any pasta dish so i dont want to single any one out hahah BUT the Chef Special (garlic, mushroom, asparagus) def tickled my taste buds in a good way.
I cannot wait to go back to try other pasta dishes as well as picking up some fresh pastas for home!

Oh ~ you order the food at the register and then take a number and make yourself comfy at a table. Your food would be brought out to you but make sure you clean up after yourself and dont be a slob!

Forma Pasta Factory,"I would give this place 6 stars if I could. Relaxed, casual, canteen style Italian, with a selection of simple, low-cost but delicious fresh pasta dishes. It's rare to find Italian where simplicity and subtlety of flavour trumps everything else; and even rarer at 11 bucks a dish.

Lovely selection of starters and deserts. Incredibly friendly staff. Beautiful setting. Daily specials. Oh, and you can buy freshly made or dried pasta to take home.

In short, I'm in love with this place. Some of best pasta I've had in NY. I plan to be a regular. I hope they start recognising me. And giving me free nibbles. Which I'll then pay for. Because this place deserves it.

So to everyone who waits for an hour to get a seat at Five Leaves... just pop next door to Forma Pasta Factory instead. Perfection.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Forma Pasta Factory,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a pasta person and yet - Forma still blew my mind. Forma is an adorable pasta shop with a cozy feel from the minute you walk in. The menu is on the wall with daily specials. The kitchen is out in the open with a huge  island that made me feel like I was sitting at home waiting for my mom to serve me lunch. The menu offers sides and salads and even a gluten free pasta option. I spent at least an hour watching a lady make pasta behind the counter. It was truly amazing and it all looked so fresh, light, and tasty. What a concept!

I ordered the kale salad, meatballs, and brussels sprouts and by the time I found a place to sit - the food was delivered to my table. Every bite was beyond delicious. If you are walking in for the pasta - make sure you get a side with it too. And if you aren't  a pasta person (like me), there's a slight chance you'll be turned. I might be :-)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"Cafeteria style restaurant focus on pastas (order, receive number, server brings food). Tables are set up for individual eating or groups of 2, 4 max.

Had the pappardelle Bolognese, pasta was al dente (nice chewy bite) and sauce was seasoned just right. For $11 the portion was right for that price and quality. If you're hungry, better order 2 or add a salad.

I'd come back here for lunch for sure to try the rest of the menu.

Forma Pasta Factory,"Absolutely lovely. Pasta was the best I've had in awhile.

I wanted to try everything but they were making a batch of meatballs that smelled so good I figured I should start there. It was a good call. The spaghetti was cooked to a perfect al dente. I was pleasantly surprised to see smaller meatballs instead of 1 or two huge ones. The sauce was well balanced and not overly salty or acidic. Delicious, and I don't feel like I need a nap afterward.

The service was great and the space is cute. Glad to have them in the neighborhood!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"Really glad this spot opened up on the Williamsburg/ Greenpoint border.

Place is cute and staff is genuine and friendly. The concept is very approachable; the pastas are a great value, simple, fast, and consistent. I've tried the Pork Ragu, Pomodoro, Bolognese, & Fettucine Mushroom and enjoyed them. The pork might be my fave so far. Food comes out realllly quick. Almost too quick?

Surprisingly decent wine list, too - glad to see an approachable Nebbiolo.

Pasta + wine special at $16... can't be beat!

Only suggestions - I once ordered a pasta to-go, and by the time I got to home the pasta had not traveled well. I appreciate the paper container, but they might want to consider how it affects the pasta (some paper was stuck to the bottom). Also would be nice to have a separate bin for used glasses from plates & utensils (I imagine glasses might get broken more frequently in the current way)... or maybe try to find stackable wine glasses?

Brought a friend to try it for the first time last week; will be back with more friends soon!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

We had two pastas and an affogato which totalled up to $28 which we thought was very value-for-money given the quality of pasta. Their pasta is made in-store and boiled to order.

We ordered the meatballs and arancini balls. All the BALLS. And they came out quick, hot, and delicious. Our pasta was on the al dente side so if you don't like that, maybe point that out when you order.

We were in a hurry so we were looking for a quick spot to grub and this was perfect. Because the food was good, we decided to take a gamble on the panna cotta and ended up being pretty good. Just a tad runny but overall still good.

Salads are great and also the appetizers.  
Their system is really cool and fast which brings me to an advice - we order allot of dishes and they can come very fast so perhaps if you are looking to order allot , try to split the order so you can enjoy slowly.
Me and my wife order 4 pastas lol. It is very hard to resist. .  Also comes super hot and Fresh .

This is the best meal you will get in Brooklyn and its beyond reasonable. You might not have a $17 cocktail with 6 kinds of bitters and 1oz of actual jiggered alcohol, or sheik rusty steel beams and imported wood fascia, nor waiters with nose rings and green hair, however, the food is as good as it gets. The portions are filling, delectable, and cheap! $11 for most items with $5 sides and $8 salad that is extraordinary! You can go to Lilia, Misi, etc. and pay $37 for lower quality if you'd like. It may not have the best ambiance, its more of a fast casual... The mushroom Parpadelle is truly extraordinary! The pasta is always aldente and the staff is always pleasant.

Excellent service, modern & fun vibe and delicious food. Can't wait to return to Brooklyn to eat here again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"Bangin'...and I don't go out of my way for pasta.  Had the pork ragu pipette, brussels and arancini.  Amazing wine deal - $16 for wine and pasta.  100% worth breaking keto over ;D",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,Damn this place as good!! It's rare when every dish in a party of 4 was on point! The serving size seems small but at $11 it slows you to get something else that way you have 2 terrific dishes instead of 1 large meal. One thing is I feel like they let themselves down by not just making it table service. Nether less highly recommend!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"This place is exactly what the neighborhood needed. $11 delicious pasta served fast but still made fresh right in front of you. We sat at the bar in front of the kitchen for an even better experience. The star of the show was of course the pasta, which as everyone else said, is perfectly cooked and has all the right flavors. I had the shrimp scampi and eggplant parm, which were both tasty and filling.

The service is great and super fast, so this would be a good spot for lunch too. It has a great vibe, being both modern and also relaxed and inviting. Definitely not trying too hard - with simple design and no millennial pink, so that's cool. It's the kind of place you want to come back to every week, and probably will to try all their daily specials.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Forma Pasta Factory,"We ordered two pastas, the fettuccine fungi and tagliatelle scampi. Both average, not bad, not amazing. Just ok. The pasta was sticking together, which meant that it had been made awhile ago. Our bill was 34$ for two pastas and two sides, which is good from a price point. I've paid a lot more for a lot worse. The arancini was decent. Overall might go back. Might.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Forma Pasta Factory,"Very fresh, flavorful ingredients, nicely cooked pasta... Got take out and it was delicious but I'd suggest they give the pasta a final toss in some olive oil to prevent it from getting so sticky during transport.

Forma Pasta Factory,"Went to Forma on Saturday night with the wife. We got the Saturday special trofie and the pappardelle ragu with a glass of wine. Both plates were excellent, and the wine was a healthy pour (for only $5 extra!). Very good amount of pasta too, not too much, and definitely not too little.

Quick side note: The manager accidentally ranged us up for 2 plates of the pappardelle though, so we were surprised to have 3 plates of pasta come to our table. The staff handled it amazingly well though, as they let us keep the extra plate of pappardelle to go and refunded us for the cost of the plate. We made sure to leave a tip for that. The manager even came by himself to apologize. The people running this restaurant are some of the nicest people, which honestly makes me just want to go back and support them.

Delicious, inexpensive pasta and really wonderful people. Do yourself a favor and come here!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Not the full restaurant experience but honestly I prefer it. In this fast paced world it's ideal. Gentleman in the front whom I image is the owner is super welcoming. Wait staff as well. Homemade past. I got the fettuccine Funghi and it's just so incredible. I'm sad that I don't live in the area. Best random food choice I've made in a long time.

Forma Pasta Factory,"Absolutely incredible--from the pasta, to the sides, to the service, and everything in between. I also love how it's more of a cafeteria style/casual restaurant, versus a sit down.

I've been to Forma three times now, and every time it just gets better and better. The pasta is fresh, the sauces are delicious, and the sides are incredible. So far, the shrimp scampi blew me out of the water more than anything else, but all the other pastas I've tried (papparadelle, pipette, agnolotti), have all been awesome. The texture of the pasta is incredible and you can taste just how fresh it is.

On the salad and side front, don't miss the kale caesar, the asparagus (it was probably the best preparation of asparagus I've ever had), or the cauliflower.

Desserts are also great and come in cute little to-go cups. The panna cotta is delicious with raspberries, and the cheescake and chocolate pudding are awesome too.

Last but not least, the service is probably some of the best that I've had in New York. Everyone is friendly--no smugness or bad attitudes here.

Overall, if you love pasta, Italian food, and great service, you should definitely check out Forma.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

We tried two of their pasta dishes (ask the servers for recommendations, they're very helpful and knowledgeable), split two appetizers, and a bottle of wine. What an amazing night. The quality of food was top-notch, the service fast, and the inside very cozy and inviting. All the ingredients were very fresh and we loved the music and overall ambiance of the place.

Forma Pasta Factory,"Love the decor. Very friendly manager(owner?) and servers. Small and almost fast-food style restaurant. Food was good but portions are extremely small; you end up buying two entrees to compensate for one and after it adds up, it can be a little pricier than other restaurants with similar concept. Also, although you tip, you end up having to clean up after yourself and putting the dishes away (think Panera style).",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Forma Pasta Factory,"I came here with a friend of mine when they opened and when I walked in I was absolutely astounded.  Your first sight is a beautifully decorated restaurant and on the right is someone making fresh pasta right in front of your eyes.  The menu is right above the pasta machine and the cashier is close by.  There are a plethora of options from fresh pasta dishes to salads and delicious sides.  My friend and I decided on the fettuccine with mushrooms and pipette ragu with Italian pork sausage and herb cream sauce.  We also got the arancini to share.  The food was made right in front of us as they have an open bar right next to the kitchen.  It was amazing to see chefs at work cooking our delicious meal right in front of our eyes.  The food was served right to our table and it was absolutely sublime.  I was enjoying my fettucine with mushrooms (divine), but when I tried my friend's pipette ragu I was amazed IT WAS EVEN BETTER.  The arancini was also a great side with a nice spicy Calabrian chili aioli, giving it a nice kick.  We enjoyed our pastas so much, that we ordered one more just before leaving, the spaghetti pomodoro.  The pomodoro sauce was just as good as the other dishes with the same al dente texture and fresh pasta.  All in all, I highly recommend this restaurant to any pasta lovers or to anyone looking for a new experience.  A restaurant that shows you the whole process, from making the fresh dough to cooking it and tossing it with delicious ragus and sauces, is definitely fresh and exciting in a place where the restaurant scene has become so saturated.  Formapasta is no joke, delivering simple and delicious pasta at an incredibly affordable price.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The place was spacious and there was plenty of seating available, even had two tables outside. Also get brownie points for having one of the cleanest and decorated bathrooms I've seen. I jumped when I saw the dog statue next to the toilet seat, thinking it was actually a real dog. But enough about the bathroom... The food was great! We had the bolognese and the scampi and both were really good. Though the sauces were good, the star of the dish was really the pasta - cooked perfectly al dente. What more could you ask for for $11?

Ordered one of the daily specials - pasta with fresh asparagus & mushrooms - truly delicious flavors textures - and yes, I did have the Kale Caesar as a side - which was also great!  Easy to order and the cashier helps explain everything really well.  You then find a seat and the food is brought to you - takes about 5 minutes for it to arrive.

Forma Pasta Factory,"Exquisite!
We purposely chose the Meatpacking classic for our first dining out in 3 months. Looking for a balance between ""everything is still the same, some things never change"" and a new post COVID 19 world. Food was delicious, service was executed perfectly and new steps of service were not intrusive but calming and seemingly natural. Wholesome experience, Pastis once more provided lifelong memories.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Forma Pasta Factory,"I was so excited when they reopened, but I had not made it down there. I recently was able to go with a very good friend of mine and we had a wonderful time! The manager came over immediately after we sat (which is always a nice touch), and our server was amazing. He made excellent recommendations, all of which we took, and we stayed forever and never felt rushed.

Though it's not quite the same as the original location, I felt super nostalgic to my younger days and late nights having mussels frites and a lovely glass of wine at the end of a late night out!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/forma-pasta-factory-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"We thought the food was very tasty. I'm usually the one that has to add a ton of salt in order for me to taste flavors-everything was seasoned perfectly. We started with freshly made lemon drop martinis, the onion soup gratin (not sure in the spelling) which was one of the best tasting onion soups I've had, artichokes with tapenade, and we both had the mussels (pei) which had a broth of white wine and garlic. Loved it! The bread was great for dipping in the broth.

We finished with the crime brûlée which was also delish. The service was very good-the music was jazz which I love. And I think this Pastis is way better than the original. The space is very beautiful and very large. And even with all this Coronavirus hysteria, come 7pm, pretty much every table was taken.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

french onion soup (amazing)
steak tartare (best dish)

great hospitality and def. will be returning (already went 4x in 3 months)",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Another silver lining on the Coronavirus cloud - I was able to snag a reservation at Pastis, something I hadn't been able to do pre pandemic, no matter how hard I tried.  Eating outside was pleasant enough, but the view of the warm, beautiful, empty interior of the restaurant was sad.  Still, the steak tartare and lobster frites were cheering, even if the energy was lacking.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Chose this place for our first dining experience in months specially because they have great outdoor dining space. The tables are spaced a good 6 feet apart and the staff wear masks and gloves at all times. The food was great - we got the lamb steak and hanger steak along with some drinks. The pomegranate spritz was perfect for the weather. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was cause the bathroom wasn't very clean.

Pastis,"Went at 10am on a Saturday and it was so peaceful and quiet. You feel like you're in a quaint Parisian cafe in the morning. So transportive. We ordered the breakfast of champions: their legendary burger and their fruit-and-whipped-cream waffle.

The burger is outstanding - deserves all the acclaim. Perfect! Juicy, crunchy, cheesy. All the flavors of a great burger. Coming back here just for that.

The waffle was good, but not burger-sized good. I would try something else next time, like their baked eggs with butternut squash creme or ham and cheese crepe.

5 stars!!!!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"It was 5pm and a third of the tables were empty but we were told they can't seat us. This was rather obviously because we were with a baby since it didn't seem to be a problem for the couples right after us. Too bad, I used to love this place before they reopened.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"I've been here a few times now and I definitely think it's a must go to spot in the area. Granted, I haven't been prior to their reopening, but the occasions I've dined there the past couple months, my experiences have been pretty positive. The first time was a Sunday brunch during the fall and it was buzzing, but not overflowing with people. Our server (really wish I remembered his name!) was very friendly / funny and accommodating to all our numerous back and forth requests and questions.

The french onion soup is probably one of the best ones I've ever tasted (it arrives piping hot and the cheese is all ooey and gooey without the bread inside being too soggy) and I highly recommend the pastry basket as well (there's only one of each type so be sure to order another one if you don't want to share).

Cheeseburger - it's a bit funny to order that in a French restaurant, but it's one of their more popular items. Both times I've ordered, the burger came out great. You have to ask for lettuce, tomato, onions, etc. though because otherwise, it only comes with pickles. It wasn't well done and both patties were cooked perfectly. It comes with a HUGE pile of fries that could be shared between two people.

The Eggs Benedict Norwegian (?) I believe was the one with the salmon. It tasted fishier than other salmon eggs benedicts I've had in the past, but the portion size was still great.

My most recent time going: I had a 1:45pm reservation. I got there 30 min early because I wanted to make sure the table we got would accommodate one of our guests who suffers from claustrophobia. By 2pm, we still weren't sat and weren't updated as to how many more people were in front of us even though it felt like everyone else was getting seated before us. The place was PACKED (probably due to all the Christmas crowds who come for the food and gorgeous Christmas decor) to the point it was overflowing and people were sitting outside to dine in FREEZING temperatures. I only got an update from the hostesses once we asked multiple times.

We ended up sitting ~2:05pm, which was frustrating because we were on a tight schedule and it was 20 min past our reservation time. I didn't expect them to sit me when I got there a whole half hour early, but the hostess even told me that they were running pretty much on time so it shouldn't be a problem. But as an example of good hospitality (that other restaurants should learn from!), they surprised us by comping the pastry basket we got, which we very much appreciated.

The dessert on the wall by the mirror is the original dessert list so it's outdated. But I highly recommend the chocolate mousse! It's very indulgent and luxurious with a ton of chocolate shavings on top. Their more popular desserts include the sticky toffee pudding (which just came out on the menu?) and the profiteroles with vanilla ice cream.

Our server this time was great as well. They honestly do so much esp with the amount of tables (albeit very low and squished esp if you sit between the bar and side window) and the running around they have to deal with and both times (even though the first Sunday brunch was a LOT more calm than the more recent one), the servers were wonderful.  

You wouldn't think the place is as big until you go in and you'll see there's a whole wraparound room in the back behind the bar with even more tables. But of course, MAKE A RES BEFORE GOING. And even then, mentally prepare yourself for the wait. But it's highly worth it!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"The infamous Pastis is back. One of the biggest restaurant scenes is warmly welcomed back to the MPD. Bustling and friendly and full of Manhattan panache with an updated menu with lots of delicious options.
Ate and drank:
Rose $7
Bread
Artichokes and tapenade
Skate
I scored an outdoor table on opening night.
One of the few places you can get a mini wine- perfect for me . Oh that Balthazar bread and butter.
Delicious French fare and Manhattan is back!
This has become like a semi toxic relationship with disappointment as standard while I love some items- the skate, the escargot and the duck confit the service can be dismissive at times.
Stick to bread and basics here as you may not always get what you want here, except ""the scene.'",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Ok so this place is amazing. The atmosphere is so great- the staff are kind, it's loud, but in the good energetic way, and the place was decorated for christmas- so great.

We started off with a quartino of wine for the table and continued to have a few martinis with a twist- the free bread was helping in not spending TOO much (eek). We ended up sharing dishes- fries, escargot, some lobster frites, and chevre salad.

Truly everything was so well put together and not too heavy. For 4 people, it was perfect to share 4 dishes.

Hard to get a reservation, but totally worth it. Saw someone call it the Cheers of NYC and I have to agree. Warm where all are welcome (although not all can afford the $500 bill)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"This is probably one of my favorite French restaurant in New York City. Came in here with friends on Friday afternoon and it was packed. However we were seated right away when both of my friends came, maybe around a 5-10 minute wait.
The service was exceptional and friendly as well. We always had our waters refilled.

We decided to order the Onion Soup, Escargot, Hanger Steak, and Avocado Tartine. We also got bread as service as well.
Onion Soup: 5/5 stars: It was so good!! The soup itself want salty and the cheese really complimented the soup.
Escargot: 5/5 stars: It was my first time trying Escargots and it was divine. The clams were very well cooked and it was very tasty.
Hanger Steak: 5/5: We got the steak Medium rare and it was very juicy. The was very filling and the fries were a great compliment along with the steak itself.
Avocado Taritine: 3.5/5: It was just like any other avocado toast with poached eggs. The avocado however had a different taste. They added lemon juice within the avocado and I think that was a smart idea to spice it up a bit. The bread however I wasn't a fan of. It was pretty hard and I don't think it was toasted so it wasn't my ideal of liking.

However service wise was pretty attentive. They checked up on us a few times and the environment is friendly. I would go back here again for another round of French food!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Honestly I wasn't impressed. I came here for brunch with my parents while they were in town and was pretty disappointed with the experience.  Our server was not good, disappeared at times, and we kept having to flag down other people for things (our drinks, ketchup, etc).

I got the smoked salmon bagel.  The salmon was pretty fresh, I'll give them that, but the cream cheese was boring and the dish only comes with cucumbers. I would've liked some onions and tomatoes too.

I ordered a side of avocado for my bagel because I was in the mood for it and it was NOT ripe, which defeats the point of enjoying avocado. Other people in our group ordered avocado toast and they had the same issue with the avocado not being ripe, though they thought the brioche bread was good.

I was disappointed based on the amount of hype for this place and likely won't be returning.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Was excited for it to reopen but a little underwhelmed by the brunch (did not do dinner). Portions were small and the bill was not.

Pastis,"Wow!! The best French food in NYC. I have a feeling you can't go wrong with any item on their menu.

Let's start with the impressive wine list - Sancerre white, red, and rose. I had the white, which was chilled, refreshing and went well with my French onion soup and moules frites.

On to the food. Holy moules frites!!! The best I've ever had. The broth was the most delicious blend of white wine, garlic, butter and lemon. And every single mussel had absorbed these delicious flavors. I could've eaten two bowls of this. My French onion soup was so good I will likely not order it anywhere else. It's either at Pastis or not at all. Profiteroles for dessert - light with just the right amount of sweetness with the chocolate and ice cream. Delicious, get it!

And last but not least, service. Our server Joseph was delightful. Such a professional and great personality! It does get a bit loud in the restaurant but you'll be too busy enjoying your food to care. Every other sentence in our conversation was ""OMG, this is so good!"" I spied some seriously good looking steaks at the table next to us - can't wait to come back and try that next.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

It was about 3/4 full and we were able to walk in and get a good table without a reservation. We had a great waiter and terrific service. We selected a bottle of white wine from their varied wine list and each had chicken pillared. It was served just the way it should be pounded flat, drizzled with olive oil along with lots of vegetables along with tons of lettuce.
They had lots of other things to choose from along with a choice of three different steaks. We will be back, maybe for dinner to try other selections.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

The appetizers though are what brought me here to Yelp. The ricotta raviolis were light and full of flavor and the sardines.... OMG....they were served in a can with oil and lemon juice and came with baguette and butter ( I could write a whole review on the butter ).

Pastis is a Keith McNally French Brasserie that has found a perfect home in the trendy Meatpacking area (dress accordingly).

We had a somewhat early reservation for dinner that ended up working well considering we were there for nearly 3 hours. Pastis is a breathtaking must experience restaurant that allows one to feel transported to France.

Our waiter Ahn was fantastic!--knowledgeable, extremely friendly/likeable and offered top notch. attentive service and suggestions. We were lucky.

We started off with champagne. I enjoyed the not so dry Tattinger's (and we were able to taste before ordering) and the other selection was a Rose style.
To accompany the champagne, we shared some appetizers:
*half dozen of delicious, ocean fresh raw oysters with two simple mignonette.
*crabmeat and avocado salad. Chunks of avocado integrated with shredded crabmeat. Refreshingly delicious and executed very well.
*small cheese plate. A soft cheese paired with a hard one accompanied by cherry preserves and roasted fennel as well as toasted baguette. I absolutely loved this mini plate. Each cheese was accompanied by a different side: either preserves. honey, almonds, etc

Now as far as the main, our entrees were the Trout Amandine with haricots verde (my selection) and the plat du jour which was an entire lobster with an amazing garlic butter sauce topped with a generous portion of pomme frites.
Both entrees had the definite wow factor.
I loved how the trout was perfectly cooked, flakey and topped with roasted, brown sugar infused almonds. Prepared exquisitely.

Saving some room for dessert, we opted for the ice cream profiteroles. Four perfectly shaped ice cream filled pastries drizzled with a chocolate sauce. A must try dessert!

Overall, Pastis is the kind  of restaurant where one can be assured of wonderful food, service and atmosphere. There was no better place to dine on a beautiful Saturday evening.

Highly recommend.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Authentic French atmosphere with NY sophistication.  Zinc tables with ring marks lends it the rustic ambiance of the French cafe.  Lamb shanks were authentically Moroccan but not overpowering the taste of the dish.  French onion soup was  delicious when paired with the chicken paillard.   Loved the warm herring and potato salad.   The frisse salad is never wrong and the filet of beef was lovely.

Beet salad was an ample portion in a horseradish sauce which was deliciously nostril-opening.  Osiel, our server, was graciously attentive and knowledgeable. Retro-hip music recalled Don Draper's wife singing Zou Bisou Biosu. Conversational level boisterous but not too loud - as the martinis flowed.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"So while I've lived in Manhattan for 15 years, I'm a huge SATC fan, somehow my first visit to Pastis was just this year round the holidays! Man, I've been missing out! Holy heck, this place is fantastic. First tip:make a reservation as it's kinda the hottest spot these days. Second one: share your way through the menu so you can try as much excellence as possible! The cheese plate, steak tartare, beet salad, green beans, and foie gras, are all magical. The wine sommelier is fantastic. He got us a delectable bottle of white Bourgogne to go perfectly with our meal. Service is delightful and you walk away feeling like you had a special evening. Can't wait to go back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Pastis,"Happy to eat once again in Pastis after all these years...

Atmosphere of the spot is (kind of) preserved, food is better than it used to be, however both service and price disappointed... maybe the 2019 meatpacking effect.

Pastis,"Pastis is back at last, in the former depressing Gansevoort Market space, which has been transformed to an excellent replica of the former dining room.

It's already packed with people on the first day from the moment they opened at 4pm. And the food is already all excellent (definitely try the new Herring appetizer).",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"The newly resurrected Pastis is already so much better than the old Pastis (different location & menu & management) ever was. It's the same concept, extensively authentic & obsessively detailed, but it's so much more spacious & comfortable, while also being much more relevant when it comes to seasonal ingredients and beautiful preparations.

Don't get me wrong, I ""grew up"" in Pastis (as well as Spice Market & Florent, Lotus & APT) in the early 2000s. Some of my most fond(led) memories were created down the street at The Lure & Hell, or around the corner at J's Hangout, and nothing ever ended a wild evening quite as lovingly as their legendary peppery 'burger; but, honestly, every single aspect of the new Pastis blows the old Pastis out of the water, and this is the only restaurant in this tourist-congested neighborhood (oh how it has changed! no more grit or grime; now there's an Hermes & Loro Piana right next door!) that I can see myself enthusiastically wanting to frequent.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"So happy to have found a place where I would come back again!

We came by on a Friday night around 7:30, hoping to get a table for 2.
It would have been a 1 hour wait to get seated inside, or there were seats available on their well-heated patio.  We settled on the patio, and it was surprisingly warm and cozy out there considering it was a chilly December night.  My husband and I really came here to try the burger, but decided to try a few other items along the way: onion soup, goat cheese & fig salad, and grilled lamb steak.  

Burger, $22 - double patty, cheese, onions, pickle, seeded bun and a mountain of fries.  We love a good burger, and while this is simple, it was so deliciously filling and juicy, the bun was nice and soft - I'd totally come back here just for that!  I was a bit disappointed at first in the 2 thin patties (I'm used to a thick medium rare patty), but they were cooked just perfectly, not dry... so good :)

The onion soup was super beefy and nicely scorched with burnt cheese on top .  One of the better soups I've had!  The grilled lamb steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare, super tender, and doused in a herby garlic oil drizzle.  

This was one of the better meals I've had in a long time, so I was really happy to have finally tried this place out!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"{Overall: 5, Food: 5} Service: 5, Atmosphere: 4.5
Pastis is one of my new New York loves. This might be the best French brasserie food I've had in NYC so far, which I wasn't sure would be the case since a lot of the emphasis is on trendiness.

I was SO impressed by the food and service and so glad I chose it for my birthday dinner. After going a second time for brunch, I've hit most of the menu highlights; here are the standouts:
*Moroccan Lamb Shank (Saturday Special)
*Artichokes
*Sardines
*Escargots
*Moules Frites
*Beef Bourguignon
*Ham and cheese crepe (brunch)

The atmosphere is so chic and lively. Because it's Meatpacking, everyone is stylish. The service is extremely friendly and attentive. Not at all pretentious. Reminds me of some brasseries in Paris.

The food is also very fresh and delightful. Everything we ordered tasted great. Between the filet mignon, the burger and the fries with garlic aioli I can't complain about a single thing. Loved the steak tartar, and the crab salad was refreshing and light. We were too full for dessert but will definitely be back to try the rest of what Pastis has to offer.

My husband ordered the filet and I the lamb which we weren't blown away by either. We'd 100% order the same apps but would try something different for the entree, or even order just a bunch of apps to share because they were so good!

Just loved the wonderful chèvre and fig salad with walnuts and creamy goat cheese. The mussels were par for the course, but we wolfed down a basket of french fries with a dijon mustard dip, just like I remembered it in Paris.

We arrived and there was a little crowd outside the door, it seems they do not let you inside if you do not have a reservation. Once in, we were promptly seated and tended to. The service was impeccable, I was truly impressed.

We ordered Mac and cheese to start which was the perfect amount of cheesy and baked. I ordered the mussels, my mom ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the cheeseburger. Everything was delicious, the mussels were in lots of white win and garlic and some of the best I've had ever. The fries were also a staple and I highly recommend having them on your table.

Pastis,"When Keith McNally first opened in Meatpacking, the area was rather crusty and just about to gentrify. Pastis was the magnet that brought celebs and other media types to the area. Very sexy and counterculture at the time, over the years Pastis became as mainstream as the neighborhood. With the High Line and the Whitney, and Hudson Yards not too far away, the epicenter of Manhattan life has clearly moved south and west. What started as a temporary closing because of reconstruction became a five year hiatus. The ""new"" Pastis is certainly worth the wait. The food, service, crowd and cocktails are all great in what is essentially a carbon copy of the original.

Pastis,"While I honestly can't remember if I ever came to the old Pastis, my dinner at the new Pastis last night was definitely memorable!

Despite the restaurant being packed (even on a Tuesday night!), my boyfriend and I were seated right around the time of our reservation. The crowd is super trendy (no surprise in Meatpacking), and noise levels were high - this is a place to see and be seen! My only minor complaint was that the chairs could be a bit more comfortable, as they're low and wooden, as are the tables, which could be more of an issue depending on your height.

The real highlight, however, was the food! Everything was delicious - we started with the crab and avocado, which was perfectly seasoned and the perfect fresh, cool dish for a warm summer night. For my entree, I had the sea scallops; now, I eat a lot of scallops, but not only were these some of the largest scallops I'd had in a while, but they were also some of the best cooked! Loved the sauce and asparagus accompaniment, as well! Finally, the dessert - I had the tarte sable à la myrtille, which is essentially a blueberry tart. As a huge blueberry lover (since who isn't?), this was absolutely amazing! A huge helping of blueberries with a sweet glaze on a bed of fresh cream encompassed in a crisp tart base - what else could you ask for? Amazing meal all around, and our server was very nice and quick, as well! Prices are in line with other restaurants in the area, but well worth it for the high quality.

But this isn't a ""new"" restaurant exactly per se. Haha

This is so many great memories that I jumped on the chance to go ASAP.

Excellent warm service, great food, and ambiance. Same as it ever was... just in a slightly different location... and little bigger.

Wine list was very very reasonable. Including (as it turns out) the same Burgundy we ended up having w our meal, also available by the glass (and some options by the carafe).

Pate and mussels and onion soup were all excellent (as always). If I had to nitpick I would say the broth on the mussels was a little bland/mild.

Hanger steak was completely on point. Fries were a bit on the salty side to be honest but it was day one and they have earned the right to get a pass.

Had a bite of my girlfriend's omelette and it was awesome too!

This classic French bistro is known more for the environment and decor rather than food but I had a wonderful time during their opening week.

We probably shouldn't have dipped our buttered bread into more escargot butter but we couldn't resist! ⁣ The hanger steak and frites were a bit of a disappointment since that's their signature dish.

Pastis,"My friends and I wanted some where different to have lunch. Her son suggested this restaurant. Getting there was half the fun. Such a great walk from 23rd St. I worked up quite an appetite. And it was worth it. The food was excellent! The half roasted chicken was tender and flavorful. My friends loved their pork and beef dishes also. Our server was attentive and  patiently answered all our questions.
The atmosphere was pleasant and the place filled up quickly with the lunchtime customers.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"I'm shook there are bad reviews. This restaurant is in my top 3 in NYC. Unbelievable food and excellent service. I've been back several times already.
The steak sandwich is out of this world. The escargo was buttery garlic salty goodness omg. And don't even get me started about the onion soup. Can't wait to be back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Pastis,"Pastis 2.0 is quickly becoming the ""cheers"" of NYC.

Their brunch menu is perfect and made delicious.  Service there is warm and welcoming with a touch of New York City; and their food you know they will deliver and be consistent.

Great job.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,A great reputation well deserved... every dish is exquisite. Good service and vibe. A quintessential new york experience.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"My sister and I went to Meat Packing to do some shopping and we popped into Pastis for a late lunch. The decor inside was modern with a rustic twist with an intimate vibe. They had music playing and the crowd was buzzing. I was shocked to see such a good crowd since Pastis is fairly new. It was a pleasant surprise to see life back in the MPD! To be honest I haven't seen a restaurant this busy down there since 2013.

To start, we ordered half a dozen oysters and escargot with a glass of rosé. The escargot was buttery with a little bit of garlic. I haven't eaten escargot since I was in Paris, but Pastis absolutely perfected this dish! Escargot is delicious when it's done right.

I had the steak sandwich and my sister had the Croque Monsieur. We shared with each other - the portions are decently sized. As a die hard carnivore, the steak sandwich is a MUST.

Our server, Clark, was knowledgeable and kind. He knew the menu inside and out and was able to provide honest and thorough answers to all of our questions. He was also very attentive; the service was on point. We will definitely be returning!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,Went looking for the best croque madame in the city.  I was not disappointed!  Thoroughly enjoyed my espresso while I waited for my food and the ambiance of this place.  I understand they only recently reopen this summer and hand peeled tiles off the wall and tin ceiling from their old location to do up the new space.  It looks like they have been there for 20 years!  Fun French bistro in Chelsea to stop in while shopping or as a destination itself!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Nope.
This place is a tourist trap. Over priced, underwhelming French bistro food. My burger looked so sad and thin. My friend's eggs looked diner plated and for the price should at least have looked better.

It's packed with tourists looking for their Sex in The City moment... But even that will not save this place once tourist season dies down.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"I was concerned that Pastis 2.0 would be little more than warmed-up Pastis rehash. When you walk in the door, however, the hostess's greeting, the subdued lighting, and the eclectic playlist provide a welcoming feeling that one doesn't get in many restaurants any more. My lovely bride and I had a stellar lunch on the day before Thanksgiving. We started with the salad verte, with haricot verts and watermelon radishes. As always, I ordered the steak tartare. If your server asks whether you want bread and butter, you should say yes because the bread is from the bakery at Balthazar. My bride ordered the steak sandwich on ciabatta and I had the best trout amandine ever. Desserts were divine:  profiteroles and the sticky toffee pudding. Service is prompt and attentive -- you sense that the staff really like working there. Highly recommended!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Pastis is back and as good as ever. I hadn't been in over a decade. But had a great iconically French meal. The French onion soup is rich and cheesy. The heirloom tomato soup with red wine vinegar was refreshing. I had the moules frites and chicken for entrees. Both quite good. Dessert was fine. The chocolate mousse was a bit too sweet, would have preferred dark, though the chocolate shavings helped. The hot chocolate was not good at all. Service was solid.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"It's back!  And the same! (Roughly, as it was in the late 90's, back in its prior incarnation down the block).  Even the cold bathroom remains cold, ha. We had a great evening here, nostalgia notwithstanding.  The wine menu is pleasantly priced, the food is solid French bistro fare, and the wait staff is fine-dining-level attentive (in the best, friendliest way).  The one knock is that it is loud af,  but shouting at your friends is one of the charms of new-old Pastis.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"My cousin who is a New York native took me here, not before he made me read the New York Times review on this fine eatablishment-worth a read for the interested. Everything was great-the ambience was amazing, dim lights, walking through the wine vault to get to the bathroom, Parisian bistro like outdoor seating, strong cocktails and awesome food. I am not super into French food but this place literally blew me away. Lots of pescetarian options, everything we tried was so fresh and incredible. Highly recommend the tuna crudo and the branzino!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Look, the atmosphere is pretty cool, the food is pretty good and the hostesses are pretty nice. But is it so much better than the average restaurant that it's worth the price? Probably not.

The Duck A L'Orange was very good, I'll admit. But a side of glazed carrots for $9? They better be paying their farmers real good.

A bite of the Steak Sandwich indicated that it's awesome as I'd heard. They've got that going for them. But the Trout Amandine and the Ricotta Ravioli Double were unmemorable.

Moreover, the space is very cramped and incredibly loud so if you're not into that, it's probably not the place for you. Also, to the owners - please remove that giant mirror in the back room - it's downward angle is a surefire way to induce headaches in patrons.

So will I stop you if you're interested in trying this restaurant? No. But will I call it a must-try? Not really.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Pastis is one of my favorite new NYC restaurant openings of the year. The interior perfectly captures the mood of the old Pastis, but with fresh new design updates for 2019. The food and service were amazing and totally on point.

Special thanks to **Cortney** who took my reservation and Darrel for taking care of us once we arrived.  Was really nice to one of the hottest restaurants in NYC be so gracious and hospitable to a new guest. Can't wait to go back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"What'a place. The service and cuisine is trill the best since way back when. Love this place. The service and food is always incredible and the atmosphere is just like it used to be from way back when. 5 star. Steak au poivre is the truth here. No better in the area. Dinner, and brunch are my things and they are never disappoint. Thanks for coming back for us Pastis. We missed you.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Pastis,"The simple  French Onion Soup was one quarter thick of Gruyre cheese with large thick clumsy  pieces of bread under these cheese.  Four of us had it thinking a place like Pastis  wouks surely make an awesome French Onion soup but were very disappointed.  As hungry as we were it was unedible.
Artichoke appetizer pretty lackluster.  

The brunch menu is better.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Ah Pastis. You are like that old high school friend that was oh so cool. Everyone wanted to hang out with you when you showed up in your spiffy clothes. But the years past and the clothes became wrinkled and eventually you sort of disappeared. We went to college, got jobs and... there you were back... in a new spiffy suit. And girls seem to like you again, but you are... well... just OK, especially for what you want.

Anyway. Yes, it is back. Yes, it is better than it was. It is barely OK for the money. In fact, it is pretty much a rip off. Its only saving grace is that it is definitely a Starr restaurant ( not Keith McNally ) which means it runs better than 90% of the restaurant groups in NYC. I will give it 4/5 for service as the runners still don't understand that there's a seat number assigned to every single seat. Every. Single. One. This means that there's no need to auction food.

Food is OK. For the price it is definitely just OK. When I pay $32 for steak frites, I expect it to be perfect, which means no burned tips at all, which, surprise you could not deliver. Fries are much improved compared to what they were but it seems that repeating Parc's (also Starr's restaurant) nailed fries is just too difficult.

Crab and avocado salad was solid but that's should be given for $23.

And finally we get to sardines. From a can. Standard can be bought in NYC without a sweat for a few dollars sardines (yes, that specific one) . They are $19  here.

So yeah, it is meh.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"This place opens at 7:30AM or something. If you're less of a bruncher and more of a full-on breakfaster, this is an excellent option and a welcome addition to the neighborhood.

even though there is literally *nothing* on the menu for vegans (I mean not even a side dish, it's fairly unprecedented) I'll go with 4 stars.

Our waiter was impeccable and kind ... and attractive. My breakfast date was hopelessly ensnared by his charm. Major flirting ensued. The waiter deflected in the most gentlemanly way. It was an impressive show of customer handling I can tell you.

We lingered over our breakfasts... or more like me pushing food around on my plate and not eating it. But my point is that no one rushed us. Then we walked around the block to Restoration Hardware and inspected gigantic chandeliers. It was a lovely morning.

It just seems odd that in this day and age, in the west village with all of us picky eaters, there wouldn't even be a bowl of oatmeal or a fruit plate available upon request.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Wow -- What an experience! This is the place to be for good looking people to eat good food (what was i doing there then, right? ha ha ha). I can't screw around with my whimsical prose too much on this review, because I just want to tell you about the food. The french onion soup - oh sweet lord have mercy on my sinning soul - it was simply unbelievable! It is an absolute MUST. The ricotta raviolis were another great appetizer, a light fluffy ricotta with a sharp and fresh tomato sauce on top. Feeling a little saucy, I decided to get the rabbit pappardelle. One of the best decisions I have made in a while. I had not tried rabbit before - and this was certainly a good introduction. The flavor of rabbit (cliche alert) truly is similar to chicken, maybe slightly more game-y. The pappardelle was amazing, the sauce was something I could see myself bathing in, and the presentation was beautiful. I also had the immense pleasure of trying a bite of the croque monsieur. It was so fluffy and delicious that I actually shed a few tears. The restaurant itself has a great ambiance, just the kind of place where you say, ""Credit score be damned - I am going to rack up one hell of a bill and eat incredible food."" You will certainly need a reservation because I cannot imagine this place wont be packed to the brim for some time to come.
I forgot to mention: As if this meal couldn't get any better, they played Gangsta's Paradise by Coolio out of nowhere. A M A Z I N G",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Great food, great service, great vibes! Glad they reopened after 5 years.  We had a wonderful dinner.  Had  fresh oysters to start & it was melt in your mouth good, the  green salad was very simple yet tasty.  Had the Sunday special which was the  stuffed tomatoes with oxtail & prosciutto over flavorful rice & was just amazing.  Also had the chicken which was moist but crispy outside, and the skate (fish) which were both fantastic.  Oh, and the frittes, it's a must try... we will be going back for sure!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Just when you thought I wouldn't go to Pastis, I did. Pastis feels a lot like The Smith, but more French. The Smith was probably an Americanized version of the old Pastis. So this Pastis is really a new French version of the Americanized old version. Follow?

Anywho, the restaurant is loud, but the food was terrific. On one plate there was almond-crusted trout, on another there was duck a l'orange, and on a third there was hanger steak frites. In a bowl we received French onion soup, topped, as is tradition, with a veil of cheese. In what I would describe as a raised plate containing six mini bowls, there was escargot. Lapping up the garlicky snail juice with the table-side bread loaf made my night.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Amazing French themed restaurant!  Located in meatpacking you walk in the it's obvious a lot of attention was given to the decorations (the bathrooms in the basement are even top notch).  The menu seems a little pricey at first, but that thought disappears once the service begins and the food arrives.  Was with 3 other people and I got the cheeseburger.  Seems simple but I had seen a photo of their cheeseburger before coming and I couldn't resist.  Best cheeseburger I've ever had!  Would highly recommend this place for brunch, lunch, or dinner!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Overall this was a very good experience: the filet au poivre, the trout amandine, and the escargots were all excellent. The burger, not so great.  Service is efficient.  Waiters know how to explain the dishes.

Pastis,"For all the hype I've heard about this place, nothing before the meal suggested that it would be any different from Balthazar or The Smith or something. The maître d seemed a little beleaguered and quoted me an hour wait, which is exactly how long it took.

Got a menu with the usual suspects on it and a waiter with some strong jokes. I ordered king crab and some oysters for the appetizer, the steak au poivr for my main, and my date got a white fish (sole?) with roasted almonds and lemon.

Now, I don't say this lightly -- and I like to think I've had some pretty damn good french food in this town -- Bouley, Daniel, EMP, Frenchette, etc -- and this place blew me away.

The fish was cooked absolutely perfectly, the lemon-soaked roasted almonds were somehow still crispy -- so good we were picking the spare bits off the plate. The steak was so rare a good vet could have saved it, and soaked under the most delicious, peppery sauce.

It's not as gourmet and creative as the EMP-level cuisine but holy hell is the food just *good.*

Absolutely recommended without qualification.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

The scene is also charming, a clubby meeting place for the old guard of city's media and design worlds. But even though it's a scene restaurant, the staff does not give off a snooty vibe. They are welcoming although a bit overwhelmed by the restaurant's success.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Just what you would expect from Starr and McNally collaboration.  Service and atmosphere were spot on but as of day 2 menu is still work in progress.  Prices were fair.  Pate was excellent but French butter was a strange accompaniment, we thought it was cheese at first.  Crab frisée, hanger steak, and salmon were good, not great.  Don't know why hanger steak is on every menu.  It's flavorful but very tough and needed something else (salsa verde?).  Salmon was perfectly cooked but over salted and needed something more satisfying than cucumber and grapefruit salad.  Skate was a big miss.  Very mushy with bones left in and unappetizing appearance.  Don't skip the bread, it's excellent.  We wanted a rose but we tested less expensive rose and it was too light and uninteresting.  Next one was $80 which is steep for rose.  3 for food and wine and 4 for both service and atmosphere.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Thanks to it being 11 got seated right away at a great table in front near the windows and the bar. While looking at the menu my friend started to look up, the ceiling was dripping from the A/C.

The waiter came over and and as we were about to mention the dripping he said ""yes it's dripping."" Um so maybe fix it. I am paying 30+ for a piece of fish I kind of expect to not be dripped on if it is something that is a known problem.

I waited just a few minutes and sat in a charming corner booth seat and it was very comfortable with a great view for people watching.

The steak sandwich that I greedily shoved down my gullet was worth the stomach ache that befell my gluttony. My mother's croque madame which I am going to assume was amazing by the orgasmic sounds coming after every bite she took. Our cocktails were pure perfection. The manager, I didn't catch his name stopped by our table. The way he described some of the dishes and how they picked the best of the best ingredients showed his passion for food and excellence in how the restaurant is ran.

Pastis,"Maybe it deserved 5 stars.

It might just be me in my older age thinking that it has just lost a little something during its reincarnation, but it has tried to replicate as the exact same offering as its predecessor and to that, it then asks to be compared.

If Pastis tried to differentiate itself then maybe I would think still more positively - the food was still great, the service friendly, but somehow the atmosphere had lost some of the sparkle. The veneer has been put back on something that didn't need it.

Pastis has a lot of great dishes to choose from, but hands down, the burger is a winner.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Very good food. Typical French fare, same as the old Pastis and Balthazar. Nothing ground breaking, just reliable. Huge, loud, messy, scene on a Saturday at 11pm. Around midnight the place calmed down and was enjoyable.

The staff was wonderful and really went out of their way to try and make sure we had an enjoyable evening, including moving us to another table when the ""girls night out"" at the table next to us was a little to rowdy. Kudos to all of them.

I would go back, just not on a weekend.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,Went to Pastis for lunch 11/1/19. The Onion soup and tuna Niçoise salad. The food was good. It is the service that is why the low star rating. You would expect your drinks before the soup. We were finished and about to receive the salad when the drinks came. The restaurant was far from crowded. Hopefully it's better IF we go again.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Excellent in every way!  Prior to dining I thought it likely that the reviews were over-hyped, but the food was indeed worthy of 5 stars. The table bread was wonderfully crusty yet soft, and the butter divine - exactly room temperature. The oysters were fresh and briney, the burger perfectly seasoned and salted. The chicken paillard was shockingly good - it had bites of vinegar and mustard and was by far the best ""boring"" chicken I've ever had.  I also loved the trout - it was well done with crispy silvered almonds and crunchy green beans.  From the front of house host to our server, the service was friendly, attentive, and unpretentious. Can't wait to return.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"The ham and cheese crepe was absolutely delicious, but left me wanting more. I would recommend ordering a side  as well. I ended up getting dessert, but left feeling like I needed more savory.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Great space with a real French feel to it. Festive ambience, nice crowd, very friendly staff, especially our waiter Flo. The food was delicious, glad it's back in the area, absolutely will be coming back.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"I wish I could say that it lived up to my memories of the old one. We were seated rather quickly by a lovely hostess next to the bar. Our waiter, originally from Northern France was wonderful. His wine suggestion of the Vouvray was perfect. He was personable and always there at the right time with more wine and a refill of water. Our dessert of Baba Rum was outstanding, served with fresh whipped cream.
I couldn't wait for my favorite meal of steak, gruyere and sautéed onions on ciabatta. Alas, the onions were no longer and the cheese was very salty. This was not my favorite dish that I had every time I went to Pastis during the week, for it wasn't served on the weekends. The community bathroom which was always fun had lost its way to the new Pastis along with my favorite meal.
Some things are best left remembered as they were and those were my memories of the original Pastis.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"I like the new Pastis better than the old for one reason, they try harder in the kitchen to please the customers, at old location you got what they felt like giving you , sometimes avg food sometimes very good food , at times you waited forever, been here to new place only twice but very good both times",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,Yes yes and yes.  So glad Pastis is back. Everything is amazing. Love sitting at the bar. Escargot to die for. Amazing burger and steak.  Desset is fantastic. Mcnally can do no wrong in my book.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Went to Pastis for brunch this AM and was told there was a delay due to a health inspection. No problem. Enjoyed our coffee and the waiter, Julian, treated us to a glass of rose. 20 minutes later, we put our order in for pain du chocolat and croque monsieurs. We had such a lovely time chatting and enjoying our brunch. Managers checked on us regularly and to thank us for our patience, our brunch was on the house.

Can't thank them enough for such a nice time with delicious food and so happy they're back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"I had the great pleasure of a late lunch here. I got in with no reservation. I really loved the old Pastis in the old location and maybe love the new one even more. The hostess was so welcoming and said 'we're happy you're back', our waiter An was wonderful. All of the staff was spot on. It looks the same, just a different configuration. The food was simple and prepared perfectly. The old Pastis was one of my favorite restaurants in the city and the new one is just as good. It was worth the wait! I'm going again this week!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Fans and regulars at the old Pastis, we were afraid it wouldn't live up to our expectations. But it did. My husband and I had the herring salad and pate for appetizers. Both were wonderful. The bread (Balthazar), of course, was terrific. We shared the bouillabaisse and I was worried as people wrote less than enthusiastic reviews, but we loved it. There were mussels, shrimp and fish in a tasty, zesty broth. With the rouille, it was absolutely delicious.

Inside was busy and noisy, but we were outdoors and totally happy. We can't wait to go back. Oh, and did I say we had to get the fries as a last minute addition. They were all around us and made us long to taste them. They may have been a tad less spectacular than I remember, but still plenty good. I have no idea why anyone was less enthused.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Good bistro food, well prepared and attentive service.
The second version of Pastis is a good choice if you want to have good food in a lively ambience in meatpacking. Main dishes (salmon and branzino) and daily special (lamb shank) were tasty. Salad appetizers over-dressed. One stand-out: the side of sauteed spinach was tasty, not oily, seasoned perfectly. The red wine selection was served at the proper temperature.
It's quite a noisy but fun ambience.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,Absurd have a res at 6 and it's almost 7 and still have not been seated plus on top of that they're not friendly.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Pastis,"Last night I went to Pastis, it reopened a few days ago and I used to go there often before it closed down, can it recreate itself, a BIG yes. The atmosphere was in full party mode. I knew many people, sat next to Stephen Sondheim, which was a thrill but let's talk about the food. Most delicious, my friend had a mouthwatering salad, then trout, I had escargot then moulles frittes, everything sooooo delicious, not over the top expensive but not cheap either. Such a great night out, can't wait to go back, Ab Fab",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"I have heard a lot people talking about this spot recently so I decided to check it out after working late one night. I was able to grab a seat at the bar which is perfect. The drinks are very well crafted but the food is overpriced and semi decent. The General Manager ""Tina"" is not the most kind person in the world either. I overheard and saw her disrespectfully talking to her staff which I do not advocate. If you are looking to go out with a group of friends this may.m be your spot. It is not how the old Pastis was. Such a shame Steven Starr.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Our dinner started out a bit rocky. We had a reservation and were told that it would be 15 more minutes if we wanted to sit outside. After waiting 35 minutes we still were not seated and opted to sit inside. The waiter was rather inattentive and pretentious in removing the stemmed wine glasses that were already on our table only to bring us cheap, low class tumblers when we opted for a carafe of wine instead of bottle. With that said, the food was absolutely incredible. My steak could not have been more tender and juicy and the desserts were equally as delicious.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"So happy to return to Pastis!! It's pretty amazing how they have recreated the space to look almost exactly the same. All the  food was delicious (Lobster Frittes, Roast Chicken, Steak Tartare, escargot) and it continues to be a great scene for people watching.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"I'm typically not a fan of the meatpacking district but Pastis is fun when at the bar with Chris. The food is good, cocktails are even better, and the people watching is always on point. Order the tuna crudo to start, the mon amer to drink, and any of the desserts. See you bar side with Chris on Tuesday and Wednesday nights!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"The newly reopened Pastis kept some of the charm from the original with French bistro decor and similar menu.
Food is excellent and very fresh but portions are on the smaller side.
We ordered the crab and avocado salad for a starter and then my husband had the calf liver and i had the steamed branzino. The liver was soft, not chewey and well marinated. The branzino was nicely prepared and meaty with nice veggies as garnish. This is hard to do for a steamed fish! For sides we got spinach and fries (more on that below). Profiteroles for desert were just OK.
The reasons for the star off is that our waiter kept disappearing and was hard to get a hold of AND their famous ""frites"" fries were really over-salted as if someone dumped a whole bag of salt so were really inedible. It took us 30 minutes to get our waiter to change the fries but it was too late, we were done with the food.
Otherwise service was good, in terms of waiter assistants and the host was very pleasant.
Would surely return again if I am in meatpacking area.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,It's back!!!!!  I only drank at the bar but it was like dejavu. It looks exactly like the same old Pastis right down to the furniture   Always a fun place!!!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"We haven't even been to the new location yet, but I already am compelled to write a review. Hallie, the Assistant Maitre D' was warm, friendly and professional. She helped me with reservations that were a bit last-minute and during a very busy time for the restaurant. Given how busy she was, she could have easily brushed me off and feigned that there were no tables available. Instead, she made me feel welcome, listened to what I was hoping to accomplish and expertly/quickly figured out a solution. We are now locked in for reservations and even more looking forward to revisiting Pastis from when we lived in the city. She sets a great standard, and any establishment or company would be lucky to have her.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"If I travel to New York I never miss Pastis!! It's an all time favorite. We love the breakfast, just like being in France. The staff is pleasant, efficient and provide for all requests. The onion soup is one of a kind. Make a reservation and don't miss it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Disappointing overall. I used to love the tuna Niçoise salad at the original Pastis. Sadly they are using fully cooked shredded tuna at the new location, instead of the nice rare tuna that is supposed to be served with Niçoise at an upscale French restaurant with discerning clientele. Just cheap and tacky on their part.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"So glad Pastis reopened! Have been twice now for food & drinks. The steak tartare, Mac & Cheese and the Cheeseburger were all really good! Also the dirty martini was made perfectly!  I can't wait to go back!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Pastis,"Just came back from brunch  for a birthday celebration at Pastis. From the door we felt very welcomed. Our waiter Fuad was amazing, prompt service and very considerate we asked him for gluten-free options and he was knowledgeable. The food smelled and tasted delicious ordered  Tuna Tartare, Herring wow, the steak and eggs, baked eggs and asparagus gluten free. When it came to dessert we were too full so he served us gluten-free ice cream for free. Just the perfect ending to a delicious brunch.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Pastis,"I used to eat at original Pastis every other week, and I have been waiting for the hype to die down so I can stop by and eat at reasonable hour.  I almost wish I haven't.  Gone is the delicious frisee lardon salad.  The steak tartare used to be the best in town, the new version I had to force myself to finish.  It's basically an bootleg version of the Pastis I loved and remembered.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Pastis,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!! I went for a date night meal my girlfriend was able to get a reservation at 5:15pm. We called to let them know we were running 10 minutes late due to traffic. We arrived at 5:25 and were not seated till 6:05. In that time I witnessed people with NO reservations walk in and get a table. There were open tables around the restaurant and we had to remind them that we had a 5:15 reservation. Finally after speaking to everyone who was there seating people we got a table. My girlfriend ordered a soup which they forgot and the excuse was she did not hear her order, yet everything else she heard. It was at that point my girlfriend spoke to Sara who was the only positive thing about this place. She was so sorry that our experience so far has been terrible. She offered numerous times to start the meal from scratch. If you want to be treated like you are not good enough for a place, then this is the place to go. I prefer a place that respects my time and knows when you have a 5:15 reservation you don't wait till 6:05 to sit.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Pastis,"I was a regular at the old Pastis and was eager to try the new incarnation. After two bad experiences, I decided to leave a review. My friend and I tried to get in on a Wednesday night 2 weeks ago and were told it was an hour and a half wait at the bar and three hours for a table. She offered to put our name
down for a table and suggested we go to The Standard for drinks and then come back! I said if we go someplace else to drink, we're not coming back. I tried for lunch on Tuesday and walked right in. Sat at the bar and it went downhill from there. There were only three other people at the bar and the bartender couldn't handle it. My coffee sat for 5 minutes before he brought it to me and he rushed me to order lunch even though it was empty and I had to tell him I wanted to relax with my coffee before ordering. I got the steak sandwich, which was awful.  Very salty (and I like salty food). It was more bread than anything else and for $29, I expected a decent amount of steak. For some reason, another bartender arrived about 10 mnts before I left. The bar was STILL mostly empty - maybe they realized the one already there was in over his head. When I was at a July 4th party yesterday, someone else mentioned they had gone to Pastis recently and also had a bad meal - very salt - and had a totally different dish. The old Pastis was never all about the food, but they need to get their act together. I live here and have an endless selection of restaurants to choose from. Pastis is definitely off my list.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Chris M is the. best. bartender. this place ROCKS. we absolutely love the bartenders and make a point to come here for a boozy lunch. they're all so kind and entertaining--we especially love Chris M!! not to mention, he's easy on the eyes ;) we love this place!!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"While the Balthazar bread and lively atmosphere  are still nice, little else is. Terrible wine list by the glass--little excuse for that -- over sauced salmon tartare that obliterated salmon taste, trout with a surfeit of brown butter obscuring the fish, and a literally bitter blueberry tart with an overly cold pastry crust.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Before entering the restaurant, the host said it would be until 930 for the next available table - when most were empty; and if we wanted to hang by the bar, it would be ""at least"" an hour wait for a COCKTAIL. I don't think I need to say more. Im sure the food is decent enough.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,Food was amazing. Service was great. Thanks to Megan (hostess) who couldnt have been kinder. Great night!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Very overhyped and definitely not worth the prices that are charged. I ordered the scallops that were recommended by the waitress. The dish was not an appetizer, but listed as a main dish. When the food arrived, there were just 4 small scallops on the plate. Nothing else on the plate like rice, potatoes, or even a vegetable. They charge $34 for this. I think that it took me 34 seconds to eat the entire entree. I would have walked out hungry if it wasn't for the salad that we had beforehand. It was almost like a bad joke and certainly a rip-off. Service was good. Overall very disappointing.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,Visited for a lovely outdoor brunch in the summer. Came early at 10am and snagged the last outdoor seats. My mussels and fries were on point. The apricot bostock was too sweet however. I love that the brunch menu is extensive and not just eggs and French toast. The place reminds me of Balthazar. Would like to return to try dinner.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Great service for my birthday. The new space is bigger than the original. Hangar steak was a bit tough and not very flavorful. Beware the nicoise salad is not a fresh cut of tuna seared on outside, it was tuna fish out of a can! That was a big disappointment. Frites were delish, as were the escargot, and the raviolis. Wish the duck was on the daily menu instead of once a week. Overall ok food, waitstaff great.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,The food was really delicious and the ambiance was fun. There were a lot of women dressed a la sex and the city. Our waiter was very sullen and didn't make eye contact or smile. He seemed to hate his job or be really tired or both. I'd go back but not for a celebratory meal (which this one was) because the waiter was a bummer.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Came to eat here with my wife and infant daughter. The white young male who attended me racially profiled me and asked to move my daughters stroller after I placed it next to another one that was near me. He wanted to remove mine and not the other stroller that was there because it belonged to a white couple. I told him If he wasn't going to move both then not to move mine. He rolled his eyes and said ok. We ordered our food, finished eating and left. Shortly after me and my wife became very nauseous and still have not felt any better since we left the restaurant. That was 8 hours ago. They also don't have changing tables for infants which makes it harder to change the diapers of your infant. I will never go here again.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"the excitement was in the air as we haven't been at pastis, one of our go-to spots, for years since it closed and recently moved here. we were after lunch looking for cover from the pouring rain and few drinks. the hostess cold demeanor made it clear that we wont get a table -non non- our expected consumption wouldn't grant it. the bar was teaming with people, those seated and those double parked near them where the ruling jersey dialect made it clear we wouldn't stand a chance. we sat at the foyer waiting for the rain to stop and watching mid-westerners carefully folding their umbrellas with broadway playbill mags popping out of their cargo shorts side pockets. the attire of the newcomers was casual to very casual marking the end of an era. we just sat there smelling the rain nostalgic for a pastis that will probably never return.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"The mussels were the best I have ever had.  Great beet salad, salmon tartare, amazing steak sandwich.  Overall, very good food.

Pastis,"Wow, Just tried make a reservation as we love love dining here.  We come all the time and usually can get in within 20 minutes.  Moved here from London and apologise if we expect social etiquette.  We spoke to someone calling herself Candice with such an attitude that was actually shocking.  They had no reservations this weekend and I had ask about the potential of a walk- in and she literally said you can try and just hung upon me.   I rang her back and asked did you literally hang up on me and Candice said she was done with me!   Seriously, Candice you are a poor representation of this amazing restaurant and I question if you have actually been out of the US let alone France as you miss the entire point of dining in an European / French restaurant.  Please let your Parent know they failed to teach you social graces, etiquette and I won't even touch  Class .  Your behavior was shocking!   Pastis, she does nothing for you and harms your business.  Too many other amazing restaurants in NY where staff actually focuses on a nice experience from beginning to end rather rather than an Interaction that creates a review like this.  Embarrassed and shocked!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Pastis,We enjoyed the pork Milanés was very good and the services was good however there are several things that I did not like about this restaurant. First of all it's extremely loud you could hardly hear yourself think. We ordered a drink of bourbon on the rocks and both my wife and I felt that the bourbon was water down. Why does such a successful place have to play with their alcohol?,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Husband is obsessed with their burger. Also, their ravioli is delicious!! I highly recommend it as a starter.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Almost as it used to be!  Good solid food, great wine list, efficient service, delightful management, and a fabulous scene to watch unfold.  I enjoyed the wine list and loved the bottle of champagne we got, the lobster frites were out of this world, as was the tuna crudo.  The steak tartar was solid, although the salad was over dressed and the salmon tartar had far too much onion, over powering the salmon and my palate.  The timing could have been better, the lobster came while we still were enjoying the steak tartar.  None the less, the people watching was great, our server was decent, although such a low talker it was Seinfeld level comical.  What!? Huh, I can't hear you!?  A manager stopped by to ask how things were, nice touch and the hostess gave me a different table when I asked for the duce on the corner and not in the middle.  Can't wait to Pastis again soon.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants

Everything was fresh and excellent! What made my experience even more worth my while was the service. I will come here again and again.

Pastis,Sat at the bar for dinner and service was not great. Steak frites were just okay. Next time will try a table and will try the hamburger.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"So happy this restaurant is back! I didn't have a reservation but had the BEST time at the bar. William was great!! He gave the best recommendations and made my friend and I feel right at home as if we were regulars that had been coming here for years! I would totally come again and again! Also, Karen the manager was wonderful as well! 5 stars for Pastis!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"The place looks wonderful and very similar to the original, with the exception of the layout. The food is no where near what it was at the original Pastis! The fries ought to be called salt sticks because all you taste is the salt, and I love salt! The prices are ridiculously high for what you are served. A cheese omelet for $17 with a few leaves of lettuce on the side? And no added choices for extra ingredients? They must be kidding. I think Keith McNally let Stephen Starr have too much power over the menu. I've never experienced a rude server at a McNally establishment until I frequented the new Pastis. It's always packed but I don't know why. Boucherie on Seventh Avenue in the Village is far superior, and they will have my business! Boucherie has the original chef from Pastis, if I'm not mistaken! Had a cheeseburger there for $13 that was superb rather than spending $22 for a sickly one at Pastis which was loaded with some nasty sauce. The stars are for the atmosphere ONLY... NOT THE FOOD!!!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"The tacos start at $3.50 each. I've tried the pork (but sweet for me), rice (coconut) bowls start at $9 with no protein (I like fish). These are my go to things to get here.  My coworker likes their shrimp for protein. Happy hour tacos on Tuesdays. Tuesday nights are packed.
Eat in has option of alcoholic beverages that can't go out the door.
Friendly service and convenient stools while you wait.
There's a wait since they make it fresh. Food is all tasty.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"Good tacos, nothing to write home about.

There's often a line down the block, and they don't answer the phone when you call to order in advance.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
Pastis,"**** COVID review***

- long ass lines ALWAYS (They only llow one person at a time)
- They don't answer the phones all the time
- It gets difficult to order online, while waiting in line
- the shrimp burrito makes the line worth it!
* I'd have to go back, exactly when they open
* There might be a line then too
- Drinks are tasty, they are not so tasty when they settle. They should be drank immediately. I know people who can stick it in the fridge and have no problem drinking later. That's not me.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Listen, the food was finger licking good or perhaps I was starving. I've had tacos, quesadillas and a burrito from here and all three were amazing. So worth the wait!! As for the drinks, they're good. A bit overpriced but you're paying for ""the hype"". They have 2 sizes, $8 and $16 + $8 for a shot for either henny or tequila. The line is always down the block but the workers work super fast! I've gone to this location 3x so I would totally recommend it to all.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,Amazing tacos and service...best in the whole city!! Def try the shrimp and jerk pork. Highly recommend,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,dont normaly do mexican but my girl likes it so we did it.  this place is da bombed.  we ordered from here and we liked it.  been wondering why we was waiting for the food to be delivered and then we git it it was late byt we ate it and it was good.   the tacos and the salad taested good.  i recommend this place to anybody cuz its really good.  onky thing is do that they late with it.  but if you git time then ordre from here.  you like it.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,I come here way to often but the food is THAT good! And the margaritas with passion fruit is everything. I don't mind the long line.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Still on point!

El Jeffe was busier than I expected, but rightfully so. The flavors with the food never fail to make me happy. If I lived any closer, it would be difficult to stay away. I've introduced this little gem to a number of people, and get jealous when they tell the picked up food without me lol.

The service is also great.  You will have to wait for your food, because each order is freshly made but absolutely worth it.

The frozen drinks are a treat and great to sip on while you wait.  Don't pass by without snatching up some really good tacos!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,It was good Mexican fusion food! It was great too see a black owned restaurant where they cooked something else besides soul food. It's kind of small inside so be prepared to wait. I loved the shrimp tacos!,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,We ordered here for lunch at work. What a nice addition to the area. I ordered the grilled chicken salad and my coworkers have the rice bowl. The food was fresh and I look forward to going one day to check out the establishment instead of having it delivered.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"To start off, business is crazy during quarantine. Their jerk pork taco, and jerk pork quesadillas were amazing! Not too spicy, a lot of crunch and that beautiful char grill taste. Very decently priced as well as their drinks which were just the right amount of alcohol, served to go of course. This establishment would have received 4 stars but I had to deduct for the security guard who wasn't pleasant. I understand we're in a time of crisis but you don't have to speak to people condescendingly or with a rude manner.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Good drinks and good food, the jerk quesadilla and fried shrimp taco are my fav along with the nachos",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,I ordered from this restaurant using Uber eats yesterday . I got the pork tacos and the pork bowl with pico de Gallo and chips . Everything in my order was fresh and felt like I was eating healthy . I would definitely order from this restaurant again . Plus I found this restaurant on black owned Brooklyn so I was happy to patronize a restaurant in my community .,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Visited today for a solo lunch after getting my wax across the street and the food is still bomb! The best part today was the amazing service I received from Shanice (spelling subjective). She was so pleasant from start to finish. Even after receiving my order and sitting down to eat, she later came by to see if everything was going well and addressed me by name. I saw her give other patrons equally great and personal service! Was highly disappointed with myself that I didn't have cash to tip her as she deserved!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"First suggestion. If you are starving, don't come here expecting an immediate order and delivery of food to fill your aching belly. This is one of those take our time to deliver some really good food, kind of spots. You've been warned. I got a steak, chicken and jerk pork taco with chips and salsa and my spouse got steak quesadilla.

The wait time... Oh that wait time... I was told that it takes a while but geez it really does. I'm speaking about that starving suggestion because that was me. I am the person that had an aching belly. I was so happy when they finally called my name. We took it to go and had a nice picnic style meal in the cool of our home ( this was one of the hottest nights of the summer, we usually eat in the living room but with no ac, that room was an automatic no.) The chicken and the steak are good but that Jerk Pork... I don't even have the words but it's all positive. I wanted to go back out and get more. They have a pineapple ( optional) in it and it is my new jam.

Really looking forward to craving tacos. Really going to call and order ahead instead.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I've been here a few times, because the Tacos are awesome! I also like quesadillas and burritos. It's a West Indian run Mexican taco spot done right. There's bar seating inside. You can order by phone as well for take out. There's no parking lot, but El Jeffe is easily accessible by by mass transit however.

My favorites are the shrimp tacos and the steak quesadillas. I'm definitely a frequent customer as long as the food stays fresh and scrumptious like it is right now!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I went here on a recommendation. I was told the food was good so I decided to give it a try after stalling. We arrived and the line was long. Nothing but a lot of young ratchet chicks and loud hood dudes. I dont know what it is about that area but when its Friday night omg! They come out their hiding place for food with their friends and make the most noise. Well as expected due to this pandemic you have to wait on a line outside to order, the floor is marked with blue take to allow for social distancing. Unfortunately they allow one person in at a time even if you came with others. I suggest groups of 2 or more designate for a person to place one collective order and you can cashapp, Venmo or quick pay that person the cost of your meal so all people in your party get food at the same time since its all made to order or else every one will be waiting for each other's meal. The guy manning the door was letting folks in one at a time, keeping the line moving quickly, in between that he was flirting with the young half naked ratchets on line. Then what I found to be annoying was some short dark skin dude poppin in and out the restaurant, talking loudly, interacting with the young ratchets yelling about how he ""out in these streets everyday"" - He need Ritalin. Desperately. I though he was a hobo but then the person I was with
Corrected me and said ""Oh no, he works there""

Anyway enough of the ""ambiance"" and on to the food. The food was good, I ordered the shrimp taco just to taste it and that's all that could be done - taste. It's very delish but twice as tiny. For $4.50 that was a bit of a scam. I also order the jerk pork burrito that was out of this world! It was so flavorful I was angry I didn't get two of them. I also tried the chips with the boss cheese and the works which was tasty as well. I really enjoyed the food

I was told this place was family owned and ran and that the grandmother seasons the food. I should have known it was nana back there with the seasoning in her good purse cause that burrito touched my soul!! I would go back but it will be a while. Idk how soon I want to deal with the crowd and workers. Especially lil Ritalin. Ole girl that bought this joint and decided to employe her uncle plus her cousin en em need to get them in line, because they are a tad ghetto and will be her undoing. Like my uncle always said as a business owner himself family and business DO NOT MIX. Hopefully she learn that soon. Because the food is good just the atmosphere is really ghetto and a turn off. Lord knows I was about to say lets skip this B.S. So in summary it was truly five stars but just the sour impression it left on me I take a star away. First impressions in business is everything to me. Groom the fam and it can easily be certified 5 stars.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,Came here when I saw the sign for lunch deal. They had $5 tortas that day and I got the beef and shrimp. The portions were perfect for lunch size and were really different and delicious. Service was a little slow and I would say they don't have a huge variety of options. But whatever they have they do well and it tastes great. Service is super friendly too and the place looks cute with the multi colored bar stools and wood interiors. I definitely recommend checking it out.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I've been here more than a few times, and the food is fresh and excellent each and every time.  I've read a lot about wait times, but I have never waited longer than ten minutes for any of my orders.  The first time, I though I'd be waiting a long time, especially since the place was full of waiting customers, so I ordered a frozen margarita for the wait.

I barely got three sips in, and my order was ready.  Was kinda annoyed that I had to leave my drink there (it was raining, the restaurant was packed, and I had someplace to go), but the food made up for all that.

My favorites:  Grilled shrimp tacos, fish tacos, fried chicken rice bowls, and grilled shrimp rice bowls, all made with coconut rice.

The staff is cool as hell, but I try not to call ahead, because the restaurant tends to be crowded all the time.  Since it's walking distance from me, it's really not an issue.  Because it's Black-owned, I'm absolutely going to continue to support them.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"This is my second time at this BLACK owned Mexican spot(!!!)and let me tell ya the tacos are freakin good AF! It's something about the shell (I think--or is it what's inside!?). I don't knowwww but after a night of libations they hit the spot! It's always a little crowded, in my opinion this is due to the fact that it is small inside; however the cashier and the cooks do a good job at keeping the food coming out fast and getting the orders right the first time! Also, try the drink that they offer called ""El Jeffe!"" It's mixture of frozen margarita, frozen sangria and wait for itttt...a shot of patron on top! Brooklyn. Black owned. Mexican food and Dranks!! It's a win win man! Go here!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,Whew Chile !so first let me start by saying I think these are the best tacos I've ever had. I got the I believe it was the fish taco the chicken taco the steak taco the shrimp taco and everything was good I went with my boyfriend and my friend so we kind of traded food because she bought nachos I think it was the shrimp nachos and the drinks were amazing to the only downside is that it's really small and it gets really packed and you might have to wait a little bit for your food but I mean it's it's a good vibe in there so it wasn't a bad wait the only downside like I said was that it's too small I don't think they thought they would get as much business as they do but yeah otherwise amazing,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Beautiful establishment and the food tastes great! I got a rice bowl this time with chips, guacamole and asked for some hot sauce. The rice was delicious topped with black beans, grilled chicken and shrimp! If your looking for a taco spot in BK, El Jeffe would come recommended!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Best teeny tiny almost $5 steak taco I've ever had. These tacos are amazing all by their lonesome without the influence of alcohol after late night bar hopping and I didn't need a beer to convince myself that I enjoyed it. In fact, if they were open past midnight I think they'd be in trouble, but handsomely profitable because it would be so packed on weekends after late night fun. Or, maybe us local taco lovers would be the ones in trouble. Please, I'd put my kitchen on 'time-out' and come here ALL the time without even thinking!

I ordered takeout from here a couple years ago and the only reason why I forgot to return again is because it cost $55 for my friend and I to attempt to get full off one meal here from takeout, not even dining in with tip. After our shrimp and chicken tacos, chips and guacamole, and splitting a quesadilla, we were still hungry (no, we didn't have the munchies!). I personally feel the (taco) portions are small but it won't stop me from coming back after this second go 'round.

The taco but was only one layer of soft shell tortilla that actually stayed put till the last bite. I will tell you, this is not your usual 'struggle' taco. On one end I was thinking the taco was so small and I finished it so fast that maybe it didn't have time to fall apart, but after complete evaluation, this taco is solid and champion status, if you ask me. There was NOT a ridiculous amount of greasy steak juice and there was no soggy tortilla letting the steak escape anywhere except to my tastebuds. I have a sister who used to cry when her tacos fell apart and I know if I brought her here, she wouldn't have any complaints! The flavor, oh boy, was memorable and I love that the taco already comes with a sliver of avocado! They know what they're doing in that kitchen.

The service was great too. The lady at the register saw me struggling on what to order as I looked thru the giant menu on the wall and asked me if I needed help while offering me my very own paper menu. I thought that was pretty nice. Most places you walk in and you can't get a hello unless you're the first to open your mouth and all they wanna do is collect your cash and get to the next customer.

I dig this spot and it's got a nice setup with great music and casual seating in front of the open kitchen. Next time, I'm going to dine in, hang out in front of their kitchen on a bar stool, watch them cook while I enjoy my tacos with a margarita and sangria or somethin'!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,This review is for the staff. When I came here years ago when they opened they were very friendly. The food is good. The place is always crowded. The last time I went back the guy working the front was not friendly at all. He practically threw down my food almost rudely. The woman was nice. But I got a bad vibe. Wouldn't be back. Food is good but I wouldn't be spending my money in place where I am not treated right.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,The food is amazing the drinks are amazing the customer service is amazing as will. Don't change anything about this place. Everything is great down to customer service. It's clean and a friendly environment...,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"El Jeffe is my go to spot when I don't feel like cooking and I just want to grab a quick bite. El Jeffe hasn't been open for years but they certainly have developed a very loyal following that includes me. As a result of their follow, during peak hours, you will probably wait a bit but it's worth it. The staff is always so welcoming and you always get service with a smile. They even have on adult beverages that are awesome. So much of what they offer is good but I especially like the jerk pork tacos with grilled pineapple. If you have two of those and some loaded nachos, you can't go wrong. So, if your in the neighborhood and your looking for a quick bite, I'd recommend you try El Jeffe.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

El Jeffe,"To begin  .. the young lady who answers the phone is completely RUDE as in person. The food is not the same as it was when this place first opened, I feel like the quality is not as great. I ordered the chicken salad which was very watered down because they use iceberg lettuce for a salad and the fish tacos was not pleasing at all! When this place first opened their food was GREAT now
idk what happen .",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"This place was extremely dissapointing, especially given that we had to watch out food being made over the course of about 50 minutes for a simple order. 30 minutes was spent melting the cheese on the quesadillas themselves. Their system was extremely inefficient in terms of how they used both the staff and equipment. People were served in seemingly random order, and the food preparation itself left a lot to be desired in terms of cleanliness and safety

I would happily have given 3+ stars of the food was tasrty, but that couldnt have been further from the truth. The jerk pork was dry, which makes since given it had been sitting out for at least the hour we waited for our food. The chips were stale. The tortillas were greasy.

I was really hoping this could be my local spot, but I won't be returning after this experience.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

This is my biweekly cheat place.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Ordered fish and fried shrimp tacos which were absolutely delicious. The fried shrimp tacos have a slight barbecued taste. The fish taco could have used a bit more fish --I thought it was a veggie taco at first!

Definitely interested in the full El Jeffe experience including margaritas and onsite customer service.

Stay tuned",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I   have never been disappointed and I've tried just about everything on the menu besides drinks (not sure why !).
Fried Chicken tacos are amazing, I  was a bit hesitant at first because I   wasn't sure how good the fried chicken would actually be but I'm so glad I   tried it, its one of my go to orders.
Ive ordered from El Jefe both for dine in, take out and through UberEats and I've never been let down, my food has always come out cooked fresh and hot.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Ok so I am giving 5 stars because it is a small business and I want this place to prosper and make a great mark in this BedStuy  neighborhood which needs more establishment like El Jeffe and I am not a big fan of people bashing independent businesses with low stars.

So,
Good things first.

Their service is pretty quick, and since it is no-tip (unless voluntary) with no table service,
I like the fact you get your food quick and chow down and leave immediately.

Jerk Pork Taco
Fried Shrimp Taco
And Fish Taco

These are seriously good and I would not bother going other place for these tacos.
They are top-notch.
Come here and order these tacos without hesitation!!

Having said that,

I am not the biggest fan of their
Boss Nachos (yeah the portions are good, but not the flavor balance)

I gave three chances for Boss Nachos before I leave any comment about it
I ordered it with Jerk Pork, Friend Chicken and maybe one time with Grilled chicken . Not at the same time. Maybe 2 months apart from each instances, and they were all through recommendation from the staff

But it is overall too salty and for some reason the cheese that they use on Nachos just does not feel right, half way through finishing it, it becomes a little nauseating to finish it, while you are not that full... and after finishing it you are indeed full (""boss"" nachos) but the cheese for some reason have negative residual impact on you.

Anyway, if they do something about the saltiness (maybe ppl eating this with beer might like it more...but not for ppl who just want to eat Nachos) and change the cheese-whiz type of melted cheese. I might give another try.
Otherwise, I recommend against the Nachos

Quesadilla and Burrito
I only had them once, so I will reserve my comment until later.

Anyway, I still love the fact that they exist in our neighborhood and I will continue to be their patrons , because their fried Shrimp and jerk Pork tacos make it worthwhile",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

El Jeffe,"El Jeffe is a great spot for a quick meal. This place blows Chipotle out of the frame. Its Mexican with a bit of a Caribbean twist if you ask me. You can order anything from your traditional tacos to a Mexican style bowl. I myself ordered the jerk pork bowl and absolutely loved it. The food was fresh and very flavorful. Another great thing about this place is that they have frozen drinks! I had a frozen margarita and it was so good and so strong! One of those drinks and you'll definitely have your moneys worth. Good affordable food, great drinks and fast service it really doesn't get any better than that!! I definitely recommend you skip right past Chipotle and make your way to El Jeffe!

FYI: definitely try the chips and melted cheese you wont regret it!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Excellent food. Great atmosphere. I found this place using Yelp. The service was efficient and my food was available in a timely manner. The place is small, but the patrons were all accommodating and the excellent service made the experience even better. They were able to accommodate a vegan diet. I will definitely eat hear again.   Oh, and the drinks were excellent.

See you soon El Jeffe!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,Now as much as I frequent El Jeffe I really thought I did a review already. I am literally here a lot. I always get the boss nacho with grilled chicken or fried chicken but I did have the steak nacho before. It is always good when I crave tex-mex with a lil twist. It is always poppin in here with a live crowd of some of everyone and good music to vibe to kinda like a club that serves mexican caribbean food. I heard the drinks are strong with a flavor kick of liquor overpowering the rest of the mix and I think you can get a complimentary drink while you wait.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,The frozen margarita is really good! Quesadilla was a little salty but for the most part good. They are very clean and organized. Will come back.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,Just had the steak quesadilla and strawberry margarita del..icioussssss omg the seasoning is excellent I also had sum.of my cuz chicken bowl it was sooooo good the food has really gotten beta from since the first time I came,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"For this to be a local American Mexican restaurant there food is AMAZING !! The customer service is exceptional.  Glad to have a place of business thats being run the right way in the heart of the stuy & ( BLACK OWNED)! Now if your not into big crowds you may wanna go during the afternoon or during the week.

Its kinda small but they do have dining area in the back where you can sit snd eat as well as  tv's where they may have the latest game or movie being played. Its a very chill vibe. You may stumble into someone you know there too. The pink lemonade is so refreshing kinda on the sweet side but its worth it  lol what pink lemonade isn't?!?

Now a little more into the food menu so they sell taco's, quesadillas, and burritos. I have yet to try the burrito
But the taco's pretty good you may need at least 2-3 to be content.  Now the quesadilla are HEAVEN SENT they essentially come with a side of sour cream and pico de gallo. The flour tortilla is lightly crispy and buttery which adds a great burst of flavor and excitement when eating that I love!  Bite after bite is like a explosion of the vibrant flavors combined into the shrimp quesadilla which is my fave !

If your in the area check them out. You wont regret it.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Solid takeout spot that feels like tex-mex with west indian flare.

I usually order the jerk pork bowl which comes with coconut rice, black beans, chips and guac. I like the portions they offer, it always seems just right.

Service is usually pretty quick and efficient. The prices seem a little high for what you get (there is a charge for anything with meat) but overall I have no complaints:)",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I love the fact that it's owned by a Woman and she's African American! Decent prices and everything is made right in front of you.
This place forever has my heart and my belly!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I came here recently for lunch with my Beau and it was crowded. We had to squeeze through the door in order to fit inside of the restaurant. They offer a limited amount of seats and it is first come first serve on the seating. After you purchase your meal/beverage you are given a number and they will bring your good to the table. The set up of this  establishment to me is more of an eat and go. It is a latin/Caribbean theme and it is black owned. They do open on time unlike some places.

You have to get the Frozen Margarita/Sangria with the extra shot of patron or Hennessey. It is delicious and so what you need to lift your spirits. It cost about $13 for one which is not bad at all. I had the Grilled Shrimp Quesdillas which was nothing special and the shrimp were more like salad shrimp in size. My beau told me the Steak Quesdillas were very tasty and he appreciates that the Steak was well done.

Overall, I will come back here for the great mix of dancehall music being played and the delicious drinks. I will try another dish on my next visit.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"The food was fine, but preparation lacks reasoning. When you prepare a salad with lettuce it would be reasonable able to put room temperature chicken on it. Nope, hot grilled chicken it is. So, while the salad was pretty good and deserves a higher rating, I cant warrant a higher rating. The fact that I had wilted lettuce and a soup of liquid on the bottom midway durring my meal,  leaves me no other choice by to rate this place as an OKAY 3 stars. A friend ordered nachos and according to her they were really good. I'll order from here in a month, and change my rating if this this hot chicken issue is resolved.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Super tasty taco shop with soul !! I really enjoyed the Fried Shrimp, jerk Chicken, fried chicken , and fish taco!! Gets crazy for Tuesday happy hour, but they are well priced and hit the spot !!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Amazing , shared the jerk pork quesadilla and steak quesadilla and both were amazing. The margarita slushy was also tasty and strong! The flavor in that meat exceeded my expectations. Mouth watering writing this review right now",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,The shrimp taco was delicious just like the sweet girl from VA at the counter said. The jerk pork taco was more loaded with meat that's distinctly jerk flavored topped with slaw and cream. Also pretty good. The Mexican corn was grilled and topped w cojita and a bath of that spicy mayo sauce that's yummy but so fatty and so much of it.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Jeffe's is the armpit of the neighborhood. And I mean a stinky, unkempt armpit.

The food is mediocre at best (The extra ""f"" in Jeffe tells you that it's not authentic Mexican, or anywhere close), the prices are a big rip-off, and worst of all, they feed excessive amounts of crappy but strong booze to a very aggressive clientele.

Thanks to Jeffe's there are fights and vandalism year round on the block. Just tonight I watched a guy knock a moped to the ground after a sidewalk fight, then he headed in for a purple margarita or whatever it is they like to give angry drunks...

Here is a video example of a typical Jeffe's sidewalk brawl: youtube.com/watch?v=6RmM…",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,Great Mexican good in BK. I had the shrimp bowl and nachos they were both delicious .,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I gave them another chance but they blew it again. I have been waiting 40 minutes in this store for my tacos while the kitchen produces nothing. Dear El Jeffe, don't believe that the community will support you no matter what in spite of your ineptitude. Hire more staff or stop taking orders. Sincerely, a hangry customer.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,Anybody who knows me well I'm really picky about my tacos. I'm a professional cook too which makes me even more picky.   Gueros in Crown Heights usually satisfies my craving. But these tacos here!  Omg.  I was blown away.  This is the Best taco place on Brooklyn.  The blend of flavors are excellent. They even have homemade hot sauce. I asked for a lid because I wanted to take the remainder home.  I wasn't going to waste if.  The staff is great too!  You guys rock!  And the margaritas had me feeling good.  Will be back. Would love to shake the owners hand.  Heard it's black owned.  Job well done.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"So many things to like about this place - the interior is very colorful and bright. Their menu is pretty extensive. And they do jerk pork tacos!

Tacos range from $3.50 to $3.50 apiece. I got the jerk pork, fried chicken, and fried shrimp. The pork and shrimp were my favorite.

Not exactly traditional tacos (hence ""New Mexican""), but still pretty good.

Only complaint was that their tortillas were pretty rubbery.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,This place is a must! The drinks and food are amazing! I visited last week Sat and I had the chicken and steak quesadilla was amazing. The El Jeffe drink is a must and I don't even like sangria but that drink is freaking good. Space is very limited. Please don't come in groups they don't take reservations. So make sure your ready to do take out or eat your food standing which is a bummer. Other than that food is amazing and drinks are awesome. Definitely will be a regular pregaming place.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"El Jeffe is a fun place to go for delicious tacos. I've yet to try something that I didn't like. The music is always good and the staff is friendly and welcoming. My staple taco is the jerk pork, but I often order the shrimp and steak tacos as well. I tried the queso and it is indeed melty cheesy goodness. I'm hoping to tear myself away from tacos on my next trip so that I can see what the burritos and rice bowls are about. The only downsides are the size and the speed of service. El Jeffe isn't very big, so don't walk in here thinking you're about to snag space for you, your mama, and your cousins. Going alone or at most three people is a solid bet for you to get counter space. Also, you will wait for your food. You will order and it will probably be ten minutes before you have tacos in hand. But! To take the edge off, order a margarita, sangria, or swirl of both to pass the time. And if you want to go on taco Tuesday, go early.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,All I have to say is jerk pork and pineapple quesadillas. Literally the best things I've ever eaten. So much food and flavor from the pineapple juices mixed with the jerk pork.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Place is small, but the food is delicious different. Everything on the menu is worth it ! They serve alcoholic drinks if that's your mood. Also happy hour tuesdays at 4:00 gets you  2$ tacos. Wish I still worked in BK",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,Amazing food! good drinks.  my favorite things are the jerk pork quesadilla with pineapple.  The steak boss nachos are the best.  Good service.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I usually hit up El Jeffe after the gym, and the menu options are healthy and filling, which is key after a workout. It's also a black owned business in the heart of Bed Stuy, which means it's usually busy! The tacos (I've had the grilled chicken, shrimp, and steak) hit the spot, and they are generous with the fillings. The rice bowl is also a smart option, and it comes with coconut rice that adds a nice hint of flavor to your meal. I've also opted for the steak rice bowl and it was enough for two meals! I can't comment on the drinks since I've only ordered to-go, but they look tasty and are well priced. A great fast casual option in the area.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,The jerk pork taco is okay. The fried chicken one was good. The best thing is the drinks. The frozen sangria is really good. I'll go back for the drinks. Tacos maybe if I was really hungry.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,The food is nice and filling & the drinks are nice. Not somewhere to die for but great quick neighborhood spot for tacos & a decent drink. In my opinion it's not a place to hang out due to such tight spacing but people do tend to hang around.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,The food is nasty and oily and the workers are very unprofessional this place is ghetto,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,Decided to stop in for a bite here after just moving into the area and wow.. definitely better than I was expecting. I got the jerk pork tacos and one fried chicken taco which were both delicious. The service was amazing and they have a free water cooler in the back which is always appreciated.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Their fried shrimp tacos are the bomb. They only deliver through UberEats which doesn't always work & is annoying as hell and the only reason I am not giving them 5 stars.
Now back to the food. I don't know who is abuelita's spirit they have locked in that kitchen but I would just like to thank her for that shrimp taco recipe. No salsa needed...pico de gallo...oh why o? It's amazing just as it comes.
Today I decided to venture from the norm and get a chicken taco too. While it was very good it was no shrimp taco and I'm about to go back and get another one because, they are just that good.
Next time, a burrito.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,Not exactly authentic Mexican food but this place is different and has a cool vibe. Jerk pork cooked on the spit was great.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Stumbled across this place after leaving my hair salon which is nearby and was glad I did. The store looks relatively new compared to other businesses nearby on that block, and that's what drew me inside. The decor of the restaurant was something that stood out, so shoutouts to whoever did the finishing touches on this place.

They have a menu that is Caribbean and Mexican infused. The have jerk items and nachos and tacos. I went for the shrimp nachos and the shrimp were seasoned and cooked to perfection. All of the toppings and ingredients went so well together and left me scraping my container hoping for more. I also had a fish taco, which was OK but not great. Stick to the nachos and you won't be disappointed, trust me.

I deducted a star because I did find their menu and options to be pretty expensive for the size of food and neighborhood they serving. Still, I will dish out the extra cash whenever I'm on that side.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I will never spend another dollar here because of something that was so simple to rectify was blatantly ignored ... I called made an order when I arrived the order was wrong (chicken nachos ) guac tomato sour cream all over it I specifically asked Jamal please put all topping on the side as I ordered shrimp quesadilla also and was giving the topping to my sister to eat with her shrimp quesadilla.. I was also told from Jamal ""oh you need to order another one"" that's our policy he was very rude and disgusting over the phone claiming he was the manager and that I didn't tell him everything on the side ( I hate tomatoes & guac ) so I know very well exactly what I ordered as I order from them very often today was the last day I tried to support black own businesses but I'm sorry this can't be overlooked simply because he didn't care enough to satisfy the customer after I spent my money",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Absolutely DELICIOUS!
My hubby and I accidentally ended up finding El Jeffe while running errands in the neighborhood. We were craving tacos and decided to check things out here. Upon walking in, the restaurant was immaculately clean and smelled incredible! We ordered the jerk pork + fish tacos along with some chicken nachos and took everything to go. Service was great, I liked the layout of the whole place and that we were actually able to watch them prepare everything right there in front of us.
WELL when we finally got home and ate, we were both surprised at how AMAZING everything was.
The jerk pork taco was one of the most delicious tacos I've EVER had and the Jeffe cheese on those nachos?! BOMB. If they deliver to us, I'm literally never ordering Mexican food from anywhere else. And that says a lot! Also, definitely looking forward to coming back and trying the margaritas!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Yummy yummy yummyz! It gets crowded but once you get your food it's all worth it, I always order the chicken nachos, they are so so good",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"OOOKKKKKKKKKK!!!!! Where do I begin?!?!?!?  

1. It is always packed- but that's a good thing. The crowd is constantly moving which shows that service is speedy and always on point.
2. The staff is accommodating and friendly.
3. The food is amazing and always consistent (I know because I eat there twice a week- don't judge)  YOU MUST TRY THE NACHOS WITH EVERYTHING ON IT-it won't disappoint!! You know food is amazing when you reheat it then next day and it still tastes great!
4. Beverages are so good refreshing and tasty

I really wish they were closer to my side of Brooklyn.  Hey El Jeffe, if you're reading this can you please set up your next shop in the East Flatbush area. Thanks in advance.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I was told this was a black owned business so by Natural law I had to visit. Walking in you encounter the large visible menu and the pick up/place order counter. I ordered my food and waited about 15 mins before inquiring as to why it was taking longer than expected. I was then told my ticket did not print.

At this point Onishka (not sure I spelt that correct, so let's refer to her as Lady O) told me the ticket had not printed and ask if I was in a rush, before given the chance to respond she immediately apologized for the millionth time and offered me a refund with free tacos and a drink !

The reasoning for the 5 stars we're primarily for the way the whole encounter was handled. She didn't tell me to wait nor did Lady O give me a bull excuse as to why my order haven't been fulfilled. She immediately addressed the issue and promptly fixed it with an added bonus, and plus the food was great!.

Even though I had a very weird first encounter at the restaurant, I will definitely be returning with no hesitation.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"The BEST SHRIMP QUESADILLA EVER! I've only ate from El Jeffe twice, but both times the food was delicious! It is more of a takeout spot due to it being limited seating but if you can order you a sangria + margarita you only need one for a little buzz. I definitely want to try other things on the menu but the shrimp quesadilla stole my heart at the first bite lol.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Let me tell you this place does not disappoint!!  I was hesitant to get the Jerk Pork burrito.  Now that I've had it,  I can say to all.  GET THE JERK PORK BURRITO.   With the pineapple.  These chefs know how to balance flavors!!   The coconut rice is a beautiful, nutty, sweet addition.  Again,  I was skeptical and am so glad I took the risk.  The service is also top knotch.  Efficient and friendly,  especially given the cramped space.  Only thing keeping it from 5-stars is the physical space and the inconsistent hours.  This is my new go-to!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"The best jerk pork tacos I've ever tried, the fried shrimp and fried chicken tacos are also really good !

El Jeffe,"Chipotle who? This place gives them a run for their money, hoping they open more.

Get the shrimp taco! It's everything. The shrimp bowl is amazing too but I lean towards the taco more. I want to try the corn and nachos next. The frozen drinks are great too.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"i actually came in for lunch after getting a wax across the street at blooming brows
I ordered two jerk pork (with comes with grilled pineapple and cole slaw) and one fish taco. needless to say they are pretty good.
it is a narrowly shaped restaurant with bar seating by the front window and across from the kitchen (it is an open kitchen by the way) . there are two tables in the back which may fit between 10 - 16 people.
i bet it gets really crowded for taco tuesday which begins after 5. tacos will be $2 each  
i also purchased a frozen blended margarita to go along with my second jerk pork taco. the jerk pork was very tender and light. the margarita contained enough alcohol to give a slight buzz without being overbearing. oh the cashier provided me with a sample of the frozen sangria which I did not care for at all. it tasted very fake and reminded me of cherry cough syrup.
i may be back to el jeffe if i am in the neighborhood again.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

El Jeffe,My honey and I decided to try this restaurant today and we were not disappointed. When we got there it was crowded which was a great sign. It has a great vibe and very clean. I ordered the shrimp grilled and fried (the fried was more delicious) and fish tacos which was yummylicious. My honey ordered the Veggie tacos it was so delicious that we ordered another round of tacos The customer service was excellent and we received our order in a timely fashion. I would highly recommend this location. Everything is fresh and cooked to perfection. Would I go back there? HELL YES!!!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I had ordered the veggie rice bowl without crema with chips and guacamole on the side. The food came in about 7 mins which wasn't that bad because they had a connect four game there that me and my girlfriend played while we waited (I won all the games) they brought the food to us we packed up then left. Portions great and they have more options than the average Mexican restaurant (chipotle). I'm vegan so I don't eat out much but this was a great add to the area you'll definitely be seeing me again!

Viva Panama,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Had the jerk chicken taco and grilled shrimp taco. It was average quality for average overpriced NYC tacos. Didn't like the cole slaw on top of the jerk chicken with minimal pineapple. The place was packed on a Wednesday night and it took 30 minutes to wait for take out.

Unfortunately I ordered the fish bow, and it is literally something I can make in my kitchen - fish was seasoned well.  THERE was NO coconut flavor to the rice, which is the only reason I tried the restaurant, and the salad was similar to the dole bag salads at your local grocery store along with the beans inside.  

Chef/Owner please work on your guacamole recipe, I seen others review the guac as something to pass on however decided to try, but yes very bland.

I'd like to give 5 stars but the shrimp quesadilla was awful, which was very surprising. I could smell the shrimp was not fresh before it came to the table, and the cheese was sparse. I would not recommend, I fact I almost gave El Jefe just 2 stars, that is how bad it was.

El Jeffe,Worst tacos I've ever had. The grilled chicken was dry. Under seasoned and too large for taco shells. The toppings came with one sliver of red onion. A tiny wedge of lime and nothing else. The taco shells were only one. Anyone who knows anything about tacos knows that tacos are always served in 2 soft shells bc the first one always breaks. I am more than happy to support businesses in my neighborhood but I must say tepache tacos are a million times better.,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Dope local spot tacos really hit the spot for me anytime I'm in the neighborhood, also the drinks are a go to as well",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I almost gave a 4 star because the wait for your food is nuts, however, it's worth it . My favorite is the fish taco. They also have a liquor license . A great neighborhood spot with friendly staff.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"While visiting family in Brooklyn my sister in law suggested I try this restaurant. Now I'm not a big fan of Spanish food because for me spicy in means spicy out. She assured me that this restaurant wasn't like that. Once pulled up the store front had an ominous appearance. Nothing outside or even inside said you're gonna like this. Fortunately, I ordered the shrimp tacos...then ordered 2 more and chased it down with a Hennessy margarita.

Stuffed and lit at the same time.

Highly recommend if you're in the area",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,NEVER & I repeat NEVER a disappointment. This is the ONLY place in Brooklyn I go to for my tacos. Real authentic tacos! Not to mention their rice bowl? OMG. I highly recommend this spot to my friends & others. The drinks? Don't get me started please. Go try it ! I'll never make reviews this long on trash food (waste of time),5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"The food is average. Somehow it's become a neighborhood staple. I stopped going because of the service. Everyone, with the exception of the guy who occasionally opens the front door for customers, has an attitude. I feel like you can't have average food and bad customer service. You have to chose one.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Loved it! Ate their Shrimp Quesadilla. In love. Absolutely worth the trip. Service was on point A tiny local spot. A twist of Mexican and Caribbean cuisine. The shrimp is seasoned well, melt cheese, crisp tortilla... it comes with tomato salsa and sour cream but it really does not need the extra sauce. Loved it so much went a 2nd time to try the Jerk Pork Quesadilla......",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,Recently went here and the food was great! My only complaint is that they charge $7 for a tiny little thing of queso and chips. It was more money then my actual meal. Other then that though great experience !,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,I came here with a group of friends for a gm fun night and I was disappointed to see that it was closed but on google it says they are suppose to be open iam confused as to what is happening,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Love, love, love this place  their mango patron margaritas are everrrrything & I don't know what's In the shrimp taco's sauce but it's amazing‼‼‼‼ I recommend this spot to every and anyone near by.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I got the rice bowl with chicken, pico de gallo, and guacamole and it was sooooo good. I got the pico and guac to mix into the rest of the rice bowl, and it worked so perfectly. The serving size is so filling and definitely a great price for all you get. The chicken was seasoned perfectly, and all the flavors of the rice, beans, pico, and guac complement red each other nicely. I would definitely recommend going here, as all the staff were so nice, the prices were right, and the food comes up pretty quickly! They have a nice place to sit and eat, or to just wait and grab food to go. There's enough on the menu to go back many times and try so many different things!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"3.75 stars (so far).

Went to El Jeffe for lunch. My first time here. So upon my arrival, I was excited that the AC worked! Lots of times you walk into a restaurant during the summer and the AC is broken, or nonexistent (a win for El Jeffe). When it was my turn to order, I decided that I wanted to try a grilled shrimp quesadilla with a side order of chips, and a soda (which come in glass bottles).

I ordered at 1:22pm and the place was pretty packed, so I expected to wait a little. A few people who ordered after me got their food before me, but no biggie. I waited patiently to indulge. And once my food arrived almost 30 mins later, I did just that. The quesadilla was nice and cheesy, I added hot sauce (my fave), and scarfed it down like no one was watching.

The chips I ordered I am enjoying as I type this review. The red salsa is delicious and a little spicy, which I love. Everyone was friendly and happy. They're waiting for their liquor license. Once they get it, I will be there for margaritas -cheers-.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I want to love this place, I really do! There are some pros and major cons.

Pros first:
- Bedstuy needs more Mexican food. We all want it, now it's here!
- Staff is super friendly. I love that.
- Restaurant is clean!
- Stays open later than most spots on Fulton (10pm!)
- Food is tasty in a savory salty sort of way. Good for an after work craving because lots of things on the menu are smothered in chipotle sauce

Cons next:
- Wait time is always long. Since they added alcohol to the menu it's longer. Whenever I stop by for a quick pick up, I have to wait 30 minutes. By then I could have been home and made my own taco!
- The biggie: Portions are SMALL for the price and ingredients don't seem to justify it.

Some backstory, I'm a fool for tiny little modern ""artisanal"" tacos at places like Calaca on Franklin BUT Calaca makes their own tortillas and the food is just perfect for goodness sake!

El Jeffe just doesn't quite cut it in terms of ingredients, but their prices are the same. It seems like they are cutting some corners with portions. I get it, they are a new business, but...

I'm not a big person nor do I have a big appetite. I can eat three of their tacos in three minutes or less. My take out bag always *feels* too light in my hand after the 30 minute wait.

Their tortillas are the same ones you buy across the street at Food town, single layered when most Mexican places double them up. Okay, I've tried handmade tortillas so I'm a little picky, I know, but if they are going to skimp on fillings I wish they'd at least double up on tortillas so I can be a little full after three tacos. And maybe add some fillers like beans in the veggie tacos so us veggie heads can have our protein.

Don't get me wrong, that big chain Chipotle's portions are way TOO large. But El Jeffe is on the opposite end of the spectrum.

Fish taco is good, veggie taco isn't worth getting so skip that one, everything is smothered in Chipotle sauce, so if you like that then go for it.

** In conclusion, Bedstuy needed more Mexican food, and Fulton street is a thoroughfare--most places don't stay open till 10 like El Jeffe, so we will probably keep going here.

Tip: If you're not in a rush, and want a filling meal, try Taqueria Milear on Nostrand and Park instead (the BEST! Grandma is rolling those tortillas back in the kitchen! And it's a great bang for your buck), or Tepache on Marcus Garvey (alright Tex mex, much more food for your dollar), or Chavela's and Calaca on Franklin.

If you're in a rush passing by this place, give it a try. It's good for a tasty and quick snack or a margarita on the go.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,This was my 1st time ever going and I ordered the steak quesadilla and a mango margarita. I really enjoyed both. Couldn't finish because of my toothache but the margarita was on point. I will definitely go again. Besides it's walking distance from my house. That jerk pork visual was heavenly!!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Let me start this off by saying I have only been here on Tuesdays. Every Tuesday from 4-7 is happy hour, all tacos (expect shrimp) are $2 and frozen margaritas and sangrias are $5. I love the grilled chicken and steak tacos! All tacos are soft! The staff is friendly. Food is prepared to order and usually ready within 15 minutes expect for Mexican corn which takes a little longer. This place is small but has a decent amount of seating. They usually have good music and or TV playing.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

El Jeffe,"LOVE EL JEFFE. Should I stop there lol. This restaurant is very close to my church (shout-out to Epiphany). My best friend and I come here sometimes on Sundays after church. So far I have had the Jerk Pork Quesadilla (AMAZING) it has little bits of pineapple in it (insert tears), I also had the veggie quesadilla which is just as Amazing it has little bits of zucchini inside. I also tried the jerk pork taco again AMAZING.  We really love the food here and the service is good as well. Definitely a gem in the neighborhood. Just some tips walk with cash if your intention is to spend under 10 dollars if it's not then your fine with your debit card. You can dine in or out it's fairly empty when we go on Sundays. They have a restroom and the staff is really chill. Please come eat here and support them !",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I have been on a taco quest for awhile. Where there is a whisper of tacos that deserve to be eaten, I'm there. The road has lead me to El Jeffe. As tacos have gotten a bit pricey these days, expectations have risen. El Jeffe tacos are in the $3-4 range which is on the high end of my taste range. I got a couple of their tacos. While the protein were flavorful, the salsa made it so much better. I essentially used the salsa on all the food. In addition, I ordered the guac w. chips, but it was a bit bland so that is something you can skip for future trips. Overall, it's a good taco, but the not the best. The journey continues...",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,Great service. Ordered one steak & 1 shrimp. 1 small mango margarita. Quick. It was about 20 bucks not cheap but good and clean & hot. I'd come once in a while if I was craving a taco.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

El Jeffe,"I've been meaning to try this place but finally was able to stumble in hungry, hot and irritated. I was warmly greeted by a young man who promptly and kindly offered me a menu. Now I love Mexican food but I have never understood people's fascination with tacos. I get chips and guac, I get quesadilas, I even get burritos but tacos????/ Meh.  From other Yelp reviews I was curious about the fried chicken taco and let me tell you I am still swooning! So simple yet so good. I want to kick myself for not ordering more than one but how could I have known? I forgive my ignorance. I also ordered a steak rice bowl which tasted fresh, chock full of steak but for me was very underwhelming in flavor as well as expensive.  My friend swears by the Margarita so I will have to stumble in here again one day after work perhaps.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Ok I'm so happy I stepped into this place. I'm new to the neighborhood and didn't know what to expect.  LITerally everything I ate was amazing.

Food
Steak Nachos, the steak was juicy and tender. It is large enough to  share or eat as an entree.

Fried chicken taco, the fried chicken was fried to perfection.  I love the sauce, I believe it was a jalapeño crema.

Grilled Shrimp taco, everything that I love - pickled onions, cotija cheese, spicy mayo

Drinks
El Jeffe!

Service
Lewis was so helpful and entertained all of our questions about the menu - That truly wasn't needed, we should have listened to him at the beginning, everything is really that good.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

El Jeffe,"I love this place.. This has to be one of my favorite Go-To food spots in the neighborhood.. The food is a tad pricey but real estate in bed stuy isnt cheap so its expected. A big plus is that the food is VERY consistent. No matter what day of the week or how many times i order, it always taste the same which is important for me.. The jerk pork quesadilla (which is very creative) and fried shrimp taco are my two favorite items. The staff is super friendly which is also a plus.

Like other customers have stated, the wait can be long and on the weekends the place can get very crowded. In all fairness you cant blame it on the business for having good food / service and attracting customers.. The simple solution? Call and order your food 10-15 minutes in advance and go pick it up. Their phone number is available on google & yelp. They'll usually have your food bagged and ready by the time you get there. All you have to do is pay and be on your way.. Keep up the good work guys..",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I said one day when I'm in the mood for it I'll try it so as I was on Uber eats I saw their restaurant pop up so I said I'll give it a try! I ordered the steak rice bowl , a fried chicken taco, and chicken quesadilla! I must say I don't usually order steak from just anywhere and it was well seasoned just wonderful!

I mostly order the steak boss nachos which have so much steak and aren't shy on any of the ingredients. They also have in traditional protein options like fried chicken and jerk pork!!!

El Jeffe,"Wow. I was working in the area, and was recommended to this spot by a coworker. WHAT? Insanely tasty. Tried several of the tacos. The fish taco was very tasty. The grilled chicken was almost as good. But the jerk pork- blew me away. Just the right amount of heat for a burn and the cool sweetness of the pineapple to balance it out. I've gotta come back if only to try the quesadillas as well as the other offerings from the menu.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I ordered fish and shrimp tacos, chips and guacamole, along with an El Jeffe-their signature drink of frozen margarita and sangria mixed. The tacos were so good, I almost bit my freaking finger trying to devour it. That sauce on the shrimp taco is perfection, get it!

To me it just tasted so bland & unflavorful. The chicken tacos were also not a hit, it was literally grilled chicken & a little bit of crumbled cheese & a couple of onions. I only liked the fried shrimp & the fish taco, those were very delicious. I'd only go back for the shrimp & fish tacos.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

El Jeffe,"Tonight my family and I visited El Jefe it was the best Mexican meal I had. My 5 year old is hard to please and not a fan of spicy food. The Chef overheard me talking my daughter about the food and asked if she had allergies. She gave my daughter a serving of chips and cheese. My daughter Loved it. I had the jerk pork, steak and chicken tacos are the bomb. The jerk pork was tender and the pineapple gives the taco an awesome taste. The chicken quesadilla taste good and my daughter enjoyed her shrimp burrito. The lemonade is just right and the service is OUTSTANDING. This place is the spot it was busy the entire time we were there we got lucky and were able to sit in the back. Heads up it's a tight squeeze. I wish they had more space for sitting. I almost didn't order as much food because I didn't want to eat standing up. Most definitely returning I want to try the nachos next time. I plan to visit again and I already know what I am ordering.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

El Jeffe,So damn good. I've eaten the fish/shrimp tacos and the quesadilla. Their seasoning is on point. Also something about it feels very community-like; like they're all family or friends.

I am a dipping sauce junkie so I wish there was a salsa verde on the side, but overall it was a great experience. I ordered for pick-up and it was ready when I got there (which was 15 mins after I called). The portion size was more than enough, which is perfect for me because small portions aren't cool to me.

El Jeffe,"I must say this is a spin on Mexican food. Its flavor is definitely not authentic Mexican. So if you're looking for  traditional Mexican flavor this is not the place . I enjoyed some of the items such as the nachos and the chicken bowl, I may return. The crowd that assembles here is Young 20s to about 30 years of age. I think there should be older more responsible people working with the younger people who I've noticed tend to have little patience with the customers. I think if the owner wants to keep his business afloat he really should consider more responsible young adults who understand the importance of customer service. The prices are a little steep for certain items such as the small tacos. It is a good contribution to the neighborhood when it comes to getting something quick and simple kudos. I really hope that customer service can be improved as soon as possible.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,The food is amazing and the service is friendly. It is a bit cramped in there but that's because it's always bustling with customers. I love how flavorful everything is.

El Jeffe,"New Mexican-Riffed joint. You can't go wrong with fresh ingredients. The Cheese and Steak Quesadillas are heftier portions than most with tons of cheese OOZing from the crusted seams. Not cheap cheese either. Comes with side of Pico de Gallo (tomatoes are really vibrant with right amount of cilantro and onions that don't overwhelm) and watered down sour cream. Not a good look!
The Grilled Chicken Rice Bowl was hearty with a ton of short-grained rice (flavorful, not overcooked), fresh cooked black beans and minutae chopped chicken. Chicken has good flavor but if they chopped it any further it would look like flecks of arroz amarillo! It's all topped with crisp iceberg lettuce and that thinned out sour cream sauce. They could & should do MUCH BETTER on that sauce. The bowls also come with Pico de Gallo and fresh Guacamole (simple).
Try the Mundet (apple soda) for solid apple flavor.
Clean, so far, and nice bathroom. Overall, worth the money and will be back. Get there early or call order ahead. They're still a little on the slower, getting adjusted side.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

El Jeffe,"This pace is great. The people who work here are very friendly, how nice! I got a chicken bowl and it was really good. The coconut rice is a great touch. The pico was ok but on the other hand, the guacamole was not only good but plentiful. It's more than what you pay for at Chipotle and this comes with the meal. To top it all off, they gave me a complimentary side of nachos. They were terrific. I would certainly come back next time I am in town and recommend it to my daughter and her friends who live nearby.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"I moved to Bed-Stuy from Crown Heights a few months ago and was wondering if I would ever eat nachos like Gueros nachos again... Little did I know that El Jeffe would pop up just down the road, like a beacon from heaven, filled with nacho goodness! I would go so far to call it Gueros 2.0 (you heard me)! I honestly can't rave enough about this spot- the food is the delicious, the owners and people working here are incredibly warm and friendly, and there's soon to be a really cool backyard and margaritas/frozen sangria. My favorite so far are the ""boss nachos,"" loaded with quest, crema and guacamole.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

El Jeffe,"Happy to see a new addition to the neighborhood. We stopped in late one night after being turned away at a few places that were closing up. while there was lots of staff working and they were extremely friendly, the food still took a long time to come out. it seemed pretty inefficient. I ordered a bowl with steak and was excited to eat it when I got home until I realized it was pretty light on the meat side. That was pretty disappointing. It didn't taste bad though, but nothing amazing. Not sure I would go back, but if passing by it's not the worst choice. Just skip the bowl unless you love extra rice.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Everything is made to order and made with Fresh ingredients!

El Jeffe,The fried shrimp tacos are good. I have had better. The wait can be insane some nights so be prepared to wait. A bit pricey.

El Jeffe,"Unfortunately, I had coney shack and there's no comparison. I had the fish and chicken tacos which were ok. First of all, the fish was seasoned with too much sazon. Too salty for anyone who needs to keep their salt intake at a norm. The chicken was ok nothing to die over. I gave it a 3 due to the fact that it's great drunken food.

El Jeffe,"It is a relatively cute place on the long and busy Fulton St. I've been passing by this place for a while now and super curious what it was about but never bothered to go in. I got the steak nachos (12$), a jerk pork taco ($3.50) and a drink. The service was just ok but definitely could be better/faster as the place was nearly empty but took forever for such simple food. The nachos were of a huge portion, so definitely worth the price (share with two people perhaps) and extremely tasty. The steak was well seasoned and the rest of the toppings were fresh and delicious. The pork taco was just okay/kind of fell flat as a cohesive taco. The meat was very tasty but the rest of the ingredients made it a very mediocre/bland taco. Jerk pork with coleslaw on a bland flour tortilla? I think I'll pass. I also had the small margarita ($8), which was just okay. Not strong and not overly sweet. Overall I would certainly go back and try other things and would certainly recommend for others to give it a try.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

El Jeffe,"I love Southern comfort cuisine, so I knew I had to try this place out. I stopped by a few weeks ago to order take out and enjoyed meeting and conversing with Mark, the person who took my order. It was really nice to just be able to talk to someone in the outside world and I felt a genuine camaraderie from Mark's friendliness and welcoming nature.

For my meal, I ordered the herb-marinated steak with green beans and roasted potatoes. With the Yelp check in, I was able to also get free cornbread. I give the restaurant props for still honoring the Yelp check in offer. Everything was packed carefully, with the cornbread in a separate container.

The steak was cooked medium well, perfectly to my liking with nice char marks all over. It was tender, juicy and bursting with flavor with all the seasonings. The green beans were pretty tasty, with plenty of garlic and had a nice crunch to it. The potatoes were not as good as I was expecting, but I was nevertheless, quite satisfied with the food.

I really liked the cornbread, which was moist, crumbly, buttery and slightly sweet.

On the way out, I promised Mark that I would return at some point. Entrees that look like they are worth trying are Molasses Braised Short Ribs, Pecan Crusted Pork, and Blackened Salmon. Thankfully, this establishment is walking distance from where I live!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
El Jeffe,"Went here for a birthday celebration brunch back in March. All the food was delicious. I had the shrimp and grits and my friend had the red velvet chicken and waffles. We shared an order of Mac and cheese which was off the chain! Waitress was nice. Drinks are strong. Tables are a bit too packed in there though, it's like you're sharing a meal with the ppl to your left and right as well and they'll hear everything you talk about. I imagine after covid the tables will probably be more spread out when things open back up so that solves that problem.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-jeffe-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Soco,"I ordered the gumbo and F-que wings in uber eats! It looked like was packed well but as I lifted the wings bag, It was too light. Well no wonder, I saw the wings left in the bottom of the paper bag... I tried the one on top that didn't touch the bag but it was not very warm. The bag looked like it would have kept the wings quite warm if it was working fine, and the sauce was great! But what a shame ... I just could not take a chance of eating the rest, that could have possibly in contact with the bottom of the bag while it was on the floor ....

Gumbo was fantastic and filling. I almost wanted to move to the nearby the restaurant to eat it very often lolol.

Other things on the menu looks fantastic as well! Can't wait to visit the store some day ...",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

She had us seated in a cozy outside/inside kind of area with real flowers. It was about 30 degrees outside but the inside was quite comfortable.

Our waitress was a hip young lady named Ronis who knew how to wait on her tables. She was attentive, confident and a breath of fresh air. Soco seems to have their things down when it comes to music selection as well. I will most definitely return there whenever I am in Brooklyn.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Food is definitely worth a visit. I got the fish and chips and it was really good. My friends and I went on a Saturday at 1pm (made reservations a few days prior to arrival). They also had a DJ playing music which I enjoyed.

Only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because their ""mimosa special"" is $40 per carafe which in my opinion is over priced especially when so many places have bottomless mimosas for the same price.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I tried to support SoCo twice during this epidemic only to be let down twice. My bill was $165 for two people. The dasher received tip and of course there was a hefty service fee BUT I wanted to support and figured the last time was just an unfortunate occurrence. Well it wasn't.

I ordered the Herb Marinated Steak (Medium Rare) that was supposed to come with collard greens and roasted potatoes. Hmmm I received a serious well done steak with potatoes and string beans. I wasn't told there would be no collards and I wish I was told the cooks couldn't properly make a medium rare steak.  See photo below.

We also ordered gumbo but it was more rice with okra and a few shrimp. The rice soaked up all the liquid so kudos! This was it for me. I tried. I really did. $25 plate, given a $7.55 credit from Door Dash.

However I just ordered a salad ($20 total paid) and as you can see in the picture this particular salad comes only with lettuce (not kale as shown on menu) shaved cheese and 4 shrimp (not jumbo). I could of actually went to a deli and received more from a salad for half the cost. I am very disappointed. I asked them to do more with the salad because picture 1 clearly has two pieces of cheese and just al lettuce. Once I received the 2nd revised salad all that was added was more cheese. No kale, no extra shrimp to ful fill the portion of lettuce in bowl. Horrible experience and $20 later.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Came here for a birthday party on a Sunday.  Sunday brunch is all day.  I had the F-Que Wings and the Mac & Cheese which everyone seems to rave about.  I also got a free order of cornbread with honey butter with my Yelp check-in.  Everything was good but my only critiques would be the dry cornbread which I'm glad was free and the tzatiki dipping sauce for the wings.  The sauce was good it just doesn't seem an ideal dipping sauce for the wings. I appreciate the fact that it's a Black owned establishment and that the servers were so eager to please.  The manager is also buzzing around constantly making sure everything is running smoothly.  
P.S. get the red sangria it's delish",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I came with a group of 5 for dinner around 8 PM on a Saturday night. Most of our group was already there before I arrived so they were waiting at the bar. However, even after we arrived we still had to wait for quite a while and saw other groups that came after us being seated before us. Additionally, while sitting at the bar we were actively ignored by the bartenders for around 5-10 minutes before they came over to ask us for our drink orders.

After we were finally seated at our table, service improved and everyone was very friendly all the way till we left.

For the food portion we ordered :

--CREOLE GUMBO : So delicious! Perfect portion of soup and rice and the flavor was so great as well! Definitely something you need to get!  

--DEVILED EGG: Very disappointing definitely skip this. Not very flavorful and pretty average.

--509 CAESAR SALAD: Average salad. I was very excited to try the cornbread croutons but they were just ok, not that fresh crunch that I expect from a good crouton.

--SEAFOOD PASTA: Pasta was so delicious though! A great amount and variety of seafood and the flavor of the sauce was great as well!

All in all food was a toss up, some were absolutely delicious and others were just average as was service. However, if I am ever in the neighborhood I would definitely be willing to give it another chance since it seemed like it had great potential.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I hope my mom never reads this butttt Soco has the best Mac and Cheese Ive ever had. I'm not sure who Aunt Cruz is but bless her soul.

Ive been to this location twice and have yet to be disappointed, I just wish they were closer to my home. The service is amazing, staff very friendly and hip. They have an awesome music selection that'd have you ready to buss a wine one second and ready to sing your heart out the next.

My first time here, I had the F-Que Wings and a side of collard greens. The wings were alright but nothing to get excited for. The greens were great and packing flavor but they were even better on my most recent visit.

I'm not sure how much I can stress it but if you ever come to Soco, the Mac and Cheese is a MUST. It was so good I took some to go but nothing is as good as it coming out fresh and hot in the little cast iron skillet. The collard green have delicious as well with a little sweet kick to them. If you think the Popeyes Chicken sandwich is good, YOU HAVE TO TRY Soco's Soul Fried Chicken Sandwich.

I can go on and on about my experience here but you have to try it for yourself.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I have no complaints.

I have been dying to try this place, and finally. Made it happen. I know this place is a staple in the neighborhood and finally got to try their famous Mac and cheese recommend by the waitress.

We ordered: jalapeños hush puppies, Mac and cheese, shrimp and grits, and jambalaya.

I CANT EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH I LOVE THE SEASONING OF THE DISHES. Shrimps were so freaking good. I should also say this is my first time having grits, and you know what? It's popping. Everything was perfectly made and just hearty. I think my fave was the jambalaya though. The shrimp was def more type of flavor than the lobster and shrimp and grits entree. The lobster needed a touch of lemon or something. But great dish nonetheless. My boyfriend inhaled it...

Where have I been?!

Oh, and the music.... R&B ALL DAY. Damn. I was dancing the entire evening in my booth.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The Mac and cheese, collard greens and cornbread was amazing! The bbq chicken dish was just okay...

But, I find that when I do go back I fall in love with their food. Everything is just so good!

The chicken & waffles are delish. & the Mac and cheese is heavenly.

Again, service sucks. The food is awesome.

I had the jambalaya with chicken, sausage, and shrimp. It was very tasty but the shrimp was a tad bit salty.

My gilfriend got the chicken and waffles. The chicken was delicious and came with a red velvet waffle. The stand out here would have to be the chicken.

Soco,"As much as I love Soco right now I am PISSED with them. I eat at Soco often. The lobster shrimp and grits and mac and cheese are my favorites. The last three times I've had soco food I ordered take out, always ordering just a mac and cheese.  Today was no different.  However when I arrived to pick up my order I realized the size of the Mac and cheese was SIGNIFICANTLY smaller. Of course for $15 I wasn't going to accept a dish that appeared to be more than half the size of the normal order. I complained to the host and he went into the back and got a manager. All he had to say was ""that's what we're offering right now"". Really at a time like this. I guess their price gouging on more than just Lysol. SOCO I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!

Of course I didn't purchase the Mac and cheese. I've included picture of containers. The black is the normal order.  The white is what they're offering now for THE SAME PRICE.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Not a lot of places make good grits lol. Would definitely be trying again, not sure about delivery because it took over an hour.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"The service in this restaurant needs HELP. I've been to Soco twice, the first time I went for brunch with a reservation and had to wait for almost 20 minutes to be seated despite the fact that the full party was there. The second time I came to Soco with a dinner reservation for a party of two, we had to wait for almost 30 minutes to be seated because the host forgot that our table was ready & he was no where to be found.

It takes over an hour to get your food whether the restaurant is 3/4 full or completely filled up. Once you're seated and you put your order in, good luck seeing your waitress again so make sure you put in ALL food and drink orders for the night at once.

I have never dined at a restaurant with service this bad, it's a shame because the food and drinks are pretty good, plus it's a black owned business so I want to support, but I gave Soco two chances and both were disappointing so Soco just isn't worth it for me.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The food was alright. The red velvet waffle breaks apart too easily it's more cakey texture. Pretty sad about that.

The side of little cornbread they give are pretty good.

Second all the servers and greeters were kind and made the experience for my date and I. Lastly the drinks once watered down were full of flavor as well as the gumbo. At this point I had high expectations for the food but the catfish just didn't do it for me. It had zero flavor with and without hot sauce it couldn't be saved. My dates jambalaya was amazing overly seasoned but what did he expect lol. The Mac was on the sweeter side but I enjoyed it a lot.

Pros:
- The food tastes amazing! The red velvet waffles were thick and rich and the chicken was well seasoned. The Mac was great as well!
- Great tunes! The DJ played a variety of music
- Our waiter was very personable and accommodating.

Cons:
- There was a lot of unnecessary waiting: we waited an hour to be seated. Even after our table was prepared, we waited an additional ten minutes to be seated. We waited 20 minutes for our mimosas (The mimosas came out at the same time as the food).
- The Pre Fixe Brunch menu doesn't include alcohol

Well obviously I've returned as here I am revising my original review. I was bamboozled into visiting SoCo late last year and I came in with my guard up ready for the horrible service I'd received in the past only to be taken aback by awesome service. I didn't know if it was a fluke so I went back earlier this year and again just this past weekend to make sure that the service, drinks and food were all consistent and guess what. THEY WERE *insert slow clap*

My Husband is obsessed with the gumbo, salmon burger and lobster shrimp and grits. I enjoyed the cornbread which is a MUST, veggie flatbread and a SoCo Bellini. The food is very tasty and they have amazing service these days so I'm a fan again. I want to try brunch and see how that goes.

They opened a lounge next door with live music. The night we had dinner which was a Thursday night the hostess came around giving out coupons for 20% your first round at the lounge.

Soco,"I couldn't try the food because they were not open even though we entered about 20-30 minutes after the posted hours. The workers were sitting at the bar chatting & simply told us they were not open, goodbye, end of conversation.

If you are not open when the hours say you are open, why is the door unlocked? Also, change the posted hours if that is not when you are open.

Why not tell us when the restaurant will open instead of just turning us away with ""we are not open."" If we were given some type of idea of when they would be open, we might've waited. However the employees were not interested in letting us know these secret hours since we clearly cannot go by the hours posted on the website.

Soco,"I had an absolutely amazing time at SoCo. My friends and I were celebrating our birthdays and decided to go for the all Sunday Brunch. The place was packed of course, but even though we were late for our reservation the hostess was able to give us a table. The waitress promptly came to our table with menus and water. She was polite and friendly. Since I had checked in on Yelp I got free con bread which was amazingly soft and warm. I ordered the chicken wings for appetizer along with the chicken and red velvet waffle. The chicken was tender and succulent. The red velvet waffle was made to perfection. One friend had the cheeseburger with French fries and the other had the shrimp with grits. Everything was so delicious  and fresh. For drinks we had the $40 mimosas carafe which is enough for more than 4 people.

During the end of our brunch the owner of the restaurant sent us complimentary cocktails drinks as a thank you for patronizing SoCo. The drinks were strong, great and refreshing.

We will definitely visit again in the future.
Would definitely",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"So! I took my lady here for some good Brunch. Made reservations for 12. Then got there late :(. They were gracious though, and we were seated in the outdoor area in the back. I was apprehensive at first but the entire area is covered so even during this cold weather we were protected.

Ambiance- Soco is very lively with a DJ playing music and even the people working there were feeling the music. It is very astounding how music makes people connect in ways they could not imagine.

Service- This is where it got a little choppy. We had a very enthusiastic server, but the people delivering our food often times went to the wrong table. They almost gave away our Mimosa drinks! Having said that, the food came very quick... speaking of.

Food- Very tantalizing. I loved the taste of my Chicken. As did my wife. She had her Lobster Shrimp and Grits. I had my allergies so she got to eat two meals (Grumbles) Red velvet was definitely a mouthful but it is just enough not to make your mouth dry. I Really enjoyed it. Such a great concept of Chicken & Red velvet waffles.

Price- This is also a chippy thing. I cannot possibly justify spending what we spent on a regular occurrence. You would have to be at a special event ( Like... a birthday ;D) to feel good about some of the pricing. You can just as easily enjoy the meals at other establishments for half of what we paid.

All in All, We had a decent experience. The factor of the Price is something you should keep in mind, but the food is really good and I would be quite upset if the meal wasn't as good as it was.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,Came here for brunch this past weekend and sat in their outside area which is heated. Everybody wins! Got rum punch by the pitcher. Ordered mac and cheese with the fried Catfish and cajun fries. Mac and cheese came in a skillet with a cheesy crust but still creamy once you dug in. Delish! Catfish was a bit on the salty side so I had to use the lemon wedge that came with it to so that helped. Other than that I'd definitely swing by here again. Waitstaff is friendly and they let us sit and talk for hours without telling us to buzz off so A+ for that.,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Soco,"This was one of the best meals I ever had! Came here for brunch with some friends. Loved sitting  in the back with the glass roof. The food was phenomenal I had the chicken sandwich and the strawberry short cake and Oreo cheesecake deserts. Everything was perfectly seasoned the sandwich was a perfect combination of salty and spicy,  the chicken was perfectly crispy. My friends had the chicken and  waffles and it was delicious as well. The deserts were also perfectly balanced not overly sweet. We also had the chicken wing as appetizer and the were some of the best wings I ever had. Been here before and will be back for dinner.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"My family, friends and I loved this place! We came here a lot! Unfortunately we will never come back. Marc's attitude towards his wife on RHOA is absolutely disgusting and disturbing. The way he speaks to women.. not just women.. his WIFE was absurd. If you weren't in love be a man and handle it accordingly. You don't embarrass your wife whom YOU asked to marry you. It was just a complete shock and I will not be giving my business to a ""man"" who doesn't respect women. My family and friends won't be bringing their business here as well. Grow up Marc, you pussy.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Came here during Sunday brunch. I was shocked to realize that the Sunday Brunch menu is different than the Saturday brunch menu. I was really looking forward to trying a particular dish.

For an appetizer, we had the cornbread and mussels. The cornbread, did not taste fresh to me. It had good flavor but was a little stale. The sweet butter that was served with the cornbeard was really good.

The mussels were a good serving. The sauce was good but I felt it was missing flavor. The creaminess over powered any seasoning that was in the mussels.

For my entree I had the steak and eggs and my spouse had the sweet potato pancakes. I ordered my steak medium well and it came as much but the steak was tough. The au jour that came with the steak had such good flavor and complimented the steak and eggs.

The sweet potato pancakes WERE THE BOMB. They were fluffy but had a nice little crisp on the outside. The blueberries and whipped cream complimented the pancakes so well.

For drinks we had the Brooklyn Bellini, Bourbon Street Mango Juice, the Brooklyn Brown, and a Singapore Sling. My favorite drink was the Brooklyn Bellini. It was the perfect Brunch cocktail.

Overall, I would come back here. The music was good, the service was great, and I would like to come back to try different dishes in their menu",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Had a 2pm reservation for two on Sunday 8/18th.  The entrance was a little crowded, but my friend proceeded quickly to the front to inform the hostess of our reservation.  The hostess couldn't find our reservation, but quickly accommodated us (we later found out my friend accidentally booked the wrong date); this was my friend's error, not Soco's.

Our waitress Essence was really friendly, professional and knowledgeable.  She helped us with our drink selections.  I went with the Mardi Gras (their take on a rum punch).  It was delicious!  I was hesitant at first concerned about the cinnamon and nutmeg overpowering the drink, but it was truly just the right balance.

My friend and I both ordered the Lobster, Shrimp and Grits (tomato broth, country creamy white cheddar).  My initial reaction when it was served, it seemed like a small serving compared to what I'm used to for Brunch servings and the price.  I felt they could've given us more grits and at least 1-2 more shrimp.  After the initial disappointment of the serving size, I went in...and while the serving size was lacking, the taste made up for it.  I didn't taste any spice at all (the tomato broth was listed as spicy) but I have a high tolerance and love spice, and I did find it to be a little salty.  It had just the right amount of cheese.  

Overall I'm fan and I'd be back if in the area but wouldn't drive out of my way for it.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Where do I start...so today I decided to wear my favorite FDNY cap & planned to grab a bite later.

So after work I decided to grab a bite to eat with my friend & we got to Soco around 7ish & the security guard states ""Hello, after 6pm the owner doesn't allow hats inside"". I immediately start to chuckle & ask ""are you kidding me, your joking right"" he than said ""no, after 6pm & it's 7pm now, no hats"". I than laugh again & think to myself ""Ashton Kutcher is doing ""Punk"" again, because this can't be real! I than said ""you really can't come in here with a hat on after 6"" & the security guard said yes, it's the owners rule. I than asked if I could speak to a manger, & the guard stated ""there's no exceptions to the rule"". F.Y.I I WAS WEARING A F.D.N.Y CAP & AFTER 9/11 I WEAR THAT CAP IN SUPPORT OF THE F.D.N.Y

This is not a 5 star restaurant, this is not a club, this is not in the meat packing district...NONE OF THAT & YOUR SAYING AFTER 6PM YOU CANT COME IN HERE WITH A HAT?!?!?!?! EVEN CLUBS HAVE RULES LIKE THAT FOR MEN, NEVER WOMEN! EVEN PUTTING THAT ASIDE FOR A MOMENT, ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!?!

Soco,"On 1/3/2020, we went to this restaurant due to the rave reviews, we were in for a big disappointment, we were a party of 3 I order Blackened Salmon I explained to the waiter I would like my Salmon medium with a warm middle, he stated ""I got you"" my Salmon was dry and bland?!? My friend order the Red Velvet Waffles and Chicken, his chicken was burnt and dry?!?! My other friend order the Steak she asked to make sure it's medium, it was rare in the middle and tough?!?! The drinks were weak!?!?! The owner stood near the kitchen never did he approach us to check on his guests ""How's everything"" Nothing!?!? But what he did was he had the waitress approach my friend to say ""Remove your hat because it's dinner time"" but he was wearing a beanie on his head!?!
Terrible Customer Service!!! Never will we return!!!!! And no, we didn't ask for replacements I DON'T TRUST THAT!! But let me give credit where credits due, the Mac N Cheese was delicious",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"SoCo is quickly becoming my go-to brunch spot in Brooklyn. The food is delicious, service is excellent and the ambiance is pretty chill and relaxed courtesy of the DJ spinning good tracks.

Food - (5/5)
The southern inspired menu with great options. My staple is the Southern Friend Chicken and Red Velvet waffles. So f'n delicious. The hardest thing is trying to decide what to get. The white wine sangria is amazing too.

Ambiance - (5/5)
Chill and casual. Great spot for a date or brunching with friends. I've only been here for brunch and it's been a great experience. Last time I went there was a DJ and she was putting in some work. Great songs and good vibes.

Location - (4/5)
Pretty conveniently located in Clinton Hill. Don't think there's a subway line near by but the bus runs down Marcy Ave. Parking hasn't been an issue the times I've driven here.

Value - (5/5)
Exceptional food and service at a fair price. It is NYC so entrees will run between $15-$25 but the portions are good.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Wings
Mac and cheese",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"We went on a Wednesday to grab a quick bite to eat. We have been craving some seafood and the waiter took our order only to come back and say they don't have any of the appitizers we ordered.
It's a Wednesday, they ran out of seafood? I'm sure the other food was great but when your craving something you want that.
We left to go somewhere else.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"We were a party of 8 and while we made reservations we were provided a table right by the door entrance on a cold rainy Sunday evening which meant through our dining evening we felt every draft and wind come right in. This area and seating should not be an option during the cold weather months.
 While the food we order was just average (order the salmon w/ sweet potato. Wings, ribs,) the rum punch was the only item which left me with an impression.

Additionally, we spoke to the waiter since one of our party members entree came out after we had finished dining. She order pasta/lasagna.

When we asked if this can be waived, because after all a dining experience is to dine as a party,
the manager blatantly said ""we don't give out free food"". And we must give back the food if we wished it to be waived off the bill due to it tardiness.

I found the manager this Sunday evening not be well versed in her vernacular, professionalism  and hence could not properly and adequately address our party without sounding not too educated. We felt sorry for her.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I ordered the grilled salmon was good, moist, well season. The lobster shrimp grits was great and I'm not a fan of grits.

Soco,"I have been coming to SoCo for years. I am now pescatarian and had stopped dining there because I felt like the menu contained more meat options. I was pleased to revisit and see they had updated their menu. The weather was nice so we asked to be seated outside, unfortunately because their plants are real, there were ants. Brunch used to be bottomless but now they offer just pitchers that was a tad bit disappointing. My friend and I started with the cornbread which was scrumptious! For our meals my friend ordered the steak and eggs, I ordered fish and chips, and we had the Mac and cheese to share. The food was good no complaints. Service was fine too. Overall experience was pleasant however the restaurant will need to do something about the ants for the outdoor seating.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Let me start by saying the food here is delicious. I've been before and loved it which is why I brought my mom, who is visiting from out of town, here for Mother's Day dinner. It will also be the last time I visit. The stars are for the food and our replacement waiter that did the best he could. But even he couldn't make up for the owner's poor service.

1. The owner stood off to the side of our table the entire time overseeing the dining room but never once came over and asked how the meal was and ask how we're doing. Basic service I get even at Applebee's but fine. I'll move on.

2. After receiving our appetizer it was almost 20 minutes before anyone came to check in us. Why? Our waitress left mid shift and no one bothered to send anyone over to our table to fill in. And yes the owner is still standing there unapologetic saying nothing. Not checking up on his guests. Not apologizing for the oversight. Not comping an iced tea for the wait nothing. But again, moving on.

3. The kicker: I spilled my iced tea on the table. It spills all on me, the table, the floor. There is a puddle on the floor and I'm scrambling to soak up the tea on the table with my 2 napkins and still he does nothing. Servers step over the puddle on the floor. I see him look at me as I'm trying to blot my pants and nothing. Finally he comes over. (Yay). He picks up the lemon that fell on the floor from my glass, hands it off to a server and returns to his post to watch the dining room. WTF!!! Didn't grab extra napkins for me. Didn't even ask a waiter to grab me napkins. Nothing. Worthless. He has a customer trying to dry herself in front of him and the only thing he cares about was a damn lemon on the floor. Pork chop,while delicious, wasn't worth the money paid for crap service. I'll take my money elsewhere.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Nice place for brunch, to preface, I would give this place a 3.5 stars, not a 3. Ambiance here is great and it fits all party sizes. I had no idea how popular it was until my friends and I saw the line already forming before it opened. Luckily, we made reservations beforehand for our party of 6, so we didn't need to wait.

We started off with the mimosa carafe and redeemed our corn bread offer from Yelp. Cuz yaaaaaas, cornbread!! The service is a little lackluster honestly. The waitress that brought the mimosa carafe was filling glasses on one end of the table and just left all the glasses at one end after filling it. I'm fine if we have to pass the glasses to the rest of the table, but maybe say something so we know? A ""do you mind passing this down?"" is all the indication that we needed. Cornbread was pretty delicious though and they did offer a pretty big portion of it.

For our entrees, I ordered the chicken & waffles and my friends ordered the bbq chicken, burgers, veggie lasagna and chicken sandwich. I had high hopes for my dish since it was a whopping $20 and it fell short of those expectations. The chicken itself was delicious - I normally don't like white meat, but this was so juicy and flavorful, I couldn't stop eating it. The skin is perfectly crispy and had a slight kick to it, which is nice. Where the dish fell flat is with the waffle. Red velvet waffle sounds cool and intriguing. I admit I was very curious as to what it would taste like, so I thought why not? The waffle was a little more on the cakey side, it is very dense and not at all what a waffle should be. The flavor was there, but without a rich buttercream or cream cheese filling, it lacks the richness factor. My other friends enjoyed their dishes it seems.

Overall, ambiance is very nice, service is eh and food is pretty good. I would come back again to try more of the food.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,The location was perfect. A quick walk to the subway on a really nice block. I notices a parking garage across the street. So we made a reservation and due to the subway system we were 9 mins late. The gentleman who greeted up who I believe was the owner said the gave out table away out ready but if we wanted to seat right away they had space in the front. If we wanted to sit anywhere else it would be a 35 or more minute wait. I was disappointed as I really didn't wanna seat by the door and wanted to see the back part of the location but I was also hungry so we took the seat up front. They do a mimosas by carafe rather than bottomless. 40 was a little to expensive for just the two so us so be passed on drinks. I decided on the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with the red velvet waffles and Mac a cheese. I wanted all dark meat but the four dollar up charge talked me out of it. I was glad I didnt. Normally white meat is too dry for me but this chicken was amazing! Perfectly seasoned and so juicy. And the waffle was just right. The Mac and Cheese was to die for! The people next to use shared their mimosa with us so that was a win. Brooklyn isn't a place to a travel to often but I would def check this place out again and make sure to be on time get better seating. January In nyc and sitting by the door can ruin a dining experience. There service was okay for the most part. The waitress did seems to have a lot of tables .,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

They were beautiful and sooooo flavorful. The cheese grits and bacon were also  delicious and the portions were very generous. My friend had the steak and eggs and he also tried the mac and cheese.

The kitchen closes between 3:30 and 5- so I had my mother arrive a little early (3:15, so we would be able to order) the staff was really cool about it, and as I included that it was my mother's birthday treated her great prior to my arrival.

I ordered the blackened Salmon-- accompanied by some sweet potatoes and green beans was excellent. I also wanted grits which were excellent as well. My daughter had the macaroni and cheese. All three of us were very pleased with the food, but I thought the service was excellent. While it was relatively empty because of the time-- the entire staff went out of their way to make sure we all were good and all members of the staff wished her a happy birthday and offered to sing for her.

Lastly, while the women were away and I was settling the bill, I inquired about a birthday cake, but I was reminded the kitchen had closed. However, the server returned and said the chef would provide me with the strawberry shortcake, if I so desired. I accepted; they cake came out almost immediately and everyone was thrilled.

The food here is phenomenal the customer service is always up to par. On this specific night, however, although the waiter was very attentive and courteous the food took an hour or more to come out. I would say the only thing that makes a major difference would be the waiter giving us updates on our order, and offering more in the entrees' absence. He wasn't doing that. You're letting the diner know you care and aware the food is taking long. In addition to the wait, my order was very bland. I would never expect something so tasteless to come out of Soco's kitchen EVER! I got the chicken sausage and shrimp Alfredo on the dinner menu. Not a go. It was very tasteless and the cheese ""sauce"" very watery. My partner went with the classic chicken and waffles and it was great. That's what i get for trying something new lol. Nonetheless, the food was great. Mac & cheese is never a let down and the red sangria was definitely a good choice.

My friend ordered the smoked chicken wings and said they were unexpectedly delicious with the tzatziki sauce. I got the fried chicken and red velvet waffle.

For the main course I had cat fish and chip. Which consisted of one fish and frozen fries . For 23 dollars they could have gave me  two fishes and fresh cut fries.

Aside from that, love the section we were in because it's like the cut. Crystal was our server. Order was taken within reasonable time. Drinks...simple....how do you mess it up. Virgin pina colada came out looking like pineapple juice. 3 men came over to check it out and then brought out what looks like a pina colada....on the rocks...that's different....no cherry, no pineapple. Lol...my mom requested a cherry at least and the manager brought out like 5. That was comical. What turned her completely off was when she said ""what happened that y'all don't know how to make a pina colada?"" He basically said you should come work for me....whew Chile was she offended lmao. I had a sweet tea, no issues. We ordered Cajun pasta, fried catfish, and marinated steak...all of our plates were cleaned. Food was good! Strawberry shortcake was a no for me, my aunt seemed to enjoy it. It's a busy night in Brooklyn, my expectations for amazing service wasn't high to begin with. My mom was annoyed, I was chill, my aunt enjoyed it all! It's was a decent night. I've been here a few times before with other people. Chill spot...worth checking out.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Decided to come here with a friend one Friday afternoon for lunch. She kept raving about their delicious mac n' cheese and said it was a must try. When we arrived, we were seated immediately because the restaurant was not super crowded.

They have a separate menu for lunch and so I decided to order the lobster, shrimp & grits...my meal was DELICIOUS and FLAVORFUL. My friend got their hamburger but wasn't super impressed because of the ""caramelized onions"" that were not so caramelized. Thanks to me checking in on the Yelp app, we got complimentary cornbread for the table with a purchase of any entree. And just because she loved their macaroni, we ordered some on the side to share. I guess it's safe to safe I see why she loves their mac n' cheese.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Crystal was a great server. We checked in and got the free corn bread as a starter, was good.
The wait here is a little wild, on the Sundays at least.
Dj is playing all morning which is relaxing. Great vibes in here for people with a young soul and like talkative environments.
I had the chicken and waffle.. waffle was ehh but I'm not a super waffle fan, chicken was amazing.
Also had the lasagna, it was eh i guess it's a dish you get if you really love veggies and can tolerate all the egg plant.
Always had the shrimp and grits at the table and they were tore up.
Would love to try everything, we had the 35$ Mardi Gras craft it was a little sweet and thick from all the syrup.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,I tried again on 3/1. A friend insisted that I give this place a 2nd chance. The food is ok. Nothing stellar but passable. The service is SLOW. For such a small restaurant I just don't get it.,1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"TO BE FAIR I AM A VEGETARIAN...

I came here for a date and it was a perfect atmosphere for it; nice ambiance, good music, and decent space. I see lots of people talking about the brunch here and I definitely want to give that a try.

I came here and the service was okay at best; I am not sure whether or not it was an off day for the waitress but it was hard to get her attention.

The food was cooked well but nothing that was so delicious it overly pleased me - I didnt take photos and I barely remember what I ordered. Decent prices for everything.

They are opening a lounge next door that we were invited to for a soft opening and if the music was better they may be on to something...cool lounge and drinks, little small.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"We came here for Friday night dinner.

Place:
- Service was great. Our waiter was helpful and suggested delicious apps
- it is dimly lit and louder in the back. Luckily we were asked if we wanted to sit in the back or in front. The front made it easier for us to hear each other.

Food:
- mussels - yum. It was flavorful with the coconut milk sauce. Wish we had more bread to soak up the sauce. The chicken sausage was not needed and didn't really do anything for the dish...
- chicken wings- bf enjoyed.
- pecan crusted pork chop - disappointing. the pork chop was really hard, and kinda dry... you can't tell it is pecan crusted
- chicken and waffles - fried chicken didn't really have any seasoning. The waffles tasted like red velvet cake.

The appetizers were so much better than the apps. If we go back, we won't bother with entrees since they were such disappointments.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I frequent this establishment , but tonight the service was so terrible I had to actually leave a review, we sat for a full hour and 15 minutes before we got so much as a drink , I asked to speak to a manager regarding the service or lack there of and even that had to be requested twice , once the manager came over he was very nonchalant about everything . The food finally comes and the Mac and cheese was cold the skillet wasn't even warm , I request a new one and they bring out a new one just as cold and dried out as the last one ..... PISSED !!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,I can't believe I waited all this time to go here!! Food was great. We had the smoked wings and mussels for apps and they were both pretty amazing. I had the chicken and waffles which was good but next time I'm going with the shrimp and grits. My husband had the jambalaya and the flavors in this dish were so intense and delicious!! We didn't get to taste the Mac and cheese because they were having kitchen issues but we took it home and had it for lunch the next day. We were not disappointed. We will be back soon for sure!!,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Caesar salad had spoiled romaine lettuce in it, gumbo was supposed to come with sausage and they didn't put any so we sent it back. French fries with chicken sandwich were supposed to be Cajun dusted but had one speck of spice on them. The chicken and waffles looked good so recommend sticking with that.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Took a quick trip to NY for my close friends' birthday and she had brunch reservations here. We couldn't be seated until the entire party arrived so I had a mimosa and she had a White Sangria while waiting. When the party arrived, we still had to wait about 30 mins to be seated so others enjoyed drinks as well. If you're an out-of-towner like myself, plan ahead for parking or take an Uber/Lyft.

When finally seated, the brunch menu is primarily southern style dishes. I was torn between many dishes but checked out my trusty Yelp and shared with the table pictures to help others decide as well. I went with my gut and ordered the red velvet waffle with chicken. I was beyond happy I could choose my selection of chicken for an extra $4. Some of us shared a carafe of what I believe is their rum punch and it was really good. When the food came out after 40 mins, OMG it was worth the wait. The chicken was to die for the mac and cheese was the best I ever had!! I'm not a big waffle eater so I ended up sharing most of it with the party. Service was great, you can use up to 4 method of payments and the staff was nice. I'm going to have to do Uber Eats next time I come up.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Soco,"Even though it was a rainy Tuesday I made my way out to SoCo in Brooklyn because I was craving some real Creole food. I ordered the jambalaya, which was soupy dirty rice with chicken, shrimp and andouille sausage. It came steaming hot and fresh off the skillet, only a bit spicy. My friend got the Lobster Shrimp and Grits, which came in a tomato base, Cajun sauce and cheesy cheddar grits. There is a no hat policy in the restaurant, so I had to remove mine upon entry. There is a full bar, with beautiful lights and a couple flat screens. The ambiance was complete with late 2000s RnB bumping softly in the background. Def a chill spot and crowd friendly, spacious, venue. The only thing is that the food was a bit pricey. For my food, an appetizer and one drink, along with time I ended up paying about $70. While the restaurant is nice, that's out of my budget for a regular Tuesday night dinner. They also overcharged my party by $30 for a drink we never had... so yeah.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Soco,"I came here last night for the first time and I was not too impressed with my experience. I'm giving Soco 2 stars because the food was delicious, however the service was not so good. First I made a 8:30pm reservation for a party of 5. Upon arrival we were seated at a crammed table that was clearly for 4 not 5 people. We were elbow to elbow and the table set up was 2 of their small tables put together. When we looked to the right side there was a table available for a party of 6. We complained to our waiter and the general manager came over to speak to us. I forgot what his name was but he was very rude and unapologetic about the situation. He stated that he didn't have other options available and that we could wait upfront for 45 mins. I told him that didn't make sense since we had a reservation which we were on time for. He responded with he has a lot of reservations. The table of 6 was then separated into a table for 4 and a table for 2. I could not believe how ridiculous they were about the seating arrangement. We couldn't even comfortably eat because we were crammed. Also parties of 5 and above they automatically add the gratuity into the bill so read your bill carefully. I might try them again for brunch but I was not impressed with their service whatsoever.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"This is my second time having brunch at this place. This place gets 5 stars all around. First off, I was able to walk right in and get seated without a reservation on a Saturday! This place gets packed so I was surprised but this made my day so much better. I sat in the back patio area. It has an enclosed glass roof and plants around the circumference of the room. I really loved the ambiance. Lots of natural light.

I ordered the strawberry shortcake French Toast and the food came out within 10 minutes of me ordering. It was delicious! I did not leave anything on my plate. I wanted to order a side but I was full enough with just the French Toast and water.

The first time I went, I had shrimp & grits as well as the Mac and cheese. You have to try the Mac and cheese!!! It's heavy but it tastes like good ole southern cooking. So great. This place is A1!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"This is THE place for Southern Comfort food!

Two of us went for dinner and we ordered dinner for three because we could not decide which yummy entree to order! Plus two appetizers!

We started with the Mac and cheese and could not put down our spoons! We also had Jalapeno Hush Puppies as the other appetizer which was also great.

For entrees, we had Fried Chicken on Red Velvet waffles, Jambalaya, and BBQ brisket. OMG! Incredible! All three were so delicious I could not say one was better than the others! Get all three! We did!

All the service was top-notch and very attentive. We were here early Wednesday night but they seem like they'd be great any night.

I'm so glad that I have a place to go to for Southern food in New York!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Haven't been here in a few years and decided to come here for brunch during Labor Day weekend. I personally love the ambiance of Soco and the staff here is very friendly!

My boyfriend and I opted to order the rum punch carafe. Wasn't a fan too much of the cinnamon flavor, but it wasn't too bad.

As for our meals, I ordered the steak and eggs which came out in a huge portion. My boyfriend ordered the soul food chicken sandwich which was amazing. Of course, we ordered a side of Mac and cheese which is one of the best I've had!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Today was our first visit at this amazing establishment. We had a reservation & had arrived approximately 20 mins early and they sat us immediately with no hassle. The music playlist was Phenomenal, the service was UNPARALLELED and the food was SUBLIME! We will most certainly be visiting again again.

As someone who grew up in Louisiana, I can attest to the superb taste of their jambalaya and that Mardi Gras drink is incomparable.

Without a doubt, if you are looking for a hearty meal in the wonderful ambience of beautiful black people -- this is the place to be !

I can assure you that I will become a regular here !",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Soco,"I've come here so many times in the past and I don't know WHAT is going on with this restaurant. I literally told a couple of people today that this is my favorite restaurant and I will personally have to retract that statement. Lately I've been noticing it going downhill, but today took the cake. To make a very long story short, multiple items on the menu they do not serve, will not make any substitutions, the cornbread was cold and hard, and I was offered an array of sides to accommodate the fact that they no longer serve what they are still serving on the menu. Any items listed as chicken sausage dishes are now pork, so please ask!! The kitchen even decided, seemingly on their own, that they would not serve salmon during brunch, even though it is on the brunch menu. I was thoroughly confused and disappointed, left hungry, and waited for food that never came for an hour. Even after it seemed like I would be taken care of for the inconvenience, I still ended up with a $25 bill for a small Caesar salad and a drink. Soco will not be seeing me or anyone I speak to for a long time until they can sort out their organizational and managerial issues. The customer should ha e a seamless experience and feel like their time is valuable. I guess this good thing is coming to an end.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Me and my girlfriends came here for Sunday brunch. The wait wasn't too long and the vibe of the restaurant was nice. There was a dj playing all the popular hits and the place had a good turnout of people. We got the Mardi gras special pitcher, which is basically a really delicious rum punch. I tried the blackened salmon, my food was seasoned well and had lots of color. I would definitely return to this place for brunch or dinner.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Soco,"LISTENNNNN...stop playing games and get your life at SOCO!

Location: Located on a trendy street of Brooklyn. Went there for a girlsnightout dinner on a Saturday evening. Parking was very easy to find!

Food: We didn't wait very long for our food to be served. There were so many delicious options on the menu that my girls had a very difficult time ordering.

I love southern cuisine but sometimes it can be greasy for me. This was not the case as SoCO. We ended up ordering 2 appetizers and 2 entrees for 3 people and it was more than enough!  See the pretty pictures. I am a huge foodie and I was very impressed that every single item we ordered was so tasty! Just the right amount of spices and flavor with a little twist on southern cuisine. My favorite was the Creole pasta.

The lemonades were perfect! I had the hibiscus one and my friends had the peach and mango. They were so good that we even got (paid) refills

Service: Our wait time was under 10 min. We were able to snag a table in their indoor patio. The inside is very noisy while the noise level is more manageable on the patio. The waiters/waitresses were prompt, pleasant, and helpful. They frequently checked on us.

Prices: on the higher end with most entrees between $20-30, but worth it IHMO! Our entire bill was $127 for 3 people bc of drinks too.

I can't wait to be back and try more stuff on the menu!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Be sure to order the pitcher of sangria (only $30- what a steal!!) the Mac and cheese (amazing) and the lastly the brisket- the most tender, most amazing piece of meat that I've ever had in....my life! So damn good.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Soco's Food is AMAZING. And honestly, this is what keeps this restaurant afloat.

Myself and my 15 Friends went out for one of their birthdays' & the service was horrendous. I was actually appalled at the level of service we received due to the fact that we were about to spend a lot of money at the establishment.

1 - There was no proper accommodation for our party to be seated, even though someone from the party spoke to a manager the day before concerning being seated in the back area (where we could've been FULLY accommodated). The manager that was present refused, stating that the area was closed and suggested that we sit in two different areas. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD SUGGEST THAT ONE PARTY SPLITS UP IN TWO AREAS. Okay cool, we decided to CRAM into one area, which meant that we had to close up the areas exit space. To use the bathroom, someone had to be interrupted so that we can physically pull one of the tables out.

2 - The hostess adjusted the lighting above us because she saw that we were doing our mini birthday speeches for the birthday girl. The manager then came over and shut the lights back off. At this point, we felt very antagonized. Trust me, I work in Customer Service so I understand that we have bad days, but his attitude was on 1000! We were on the verge of leaving but as stated above, the birthday girl wanted to taste the food that everyone raved about.

----

The other servers saved the day and made us a little more comfortable, but that meant we needed the manager to stay far away. Overall, the experience turned out to be as smooth as possible because we didnt want the birthday girl to feel like her birthday was ruined. She ended the night with the people she loved despite this horrible experience.

I'm not one to say ""NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE"" because I believe in second chances. However, its only right that you brace yourself IN CASE you have a similar encounter.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Everything was going good until my friend saw a roach crawling on the wall next to her, we called a waitress over, she grabbed a napkin and came over and killed it. We were starving & drove all the way from Queens and decided to stay , no manager came over to apologize or to accommodate the situation. Please get an exterminator asap. Then our waitress disappeared on us for 20 mins , I waved my napkin in the air to cause attention , a bus boy saw me and came over and helped us with doggie bags and our check.

Soco,I've been to Soco twice. Once for my cousin's bridal party and second with my boyfriend. So I've seen the hype nightlife atmosphere and the calm lunch atmosphere. I will say that the chicken and waffles and the Mac and cheese are both delicious menu options that I'd continue ordering every time I come to Soco. The night vibes are really cool but it's also a great place to have nice lunch with with someone.

Soco,"This restaurant has been on my list of NY eateries for quite sometime and I was able to check it off today! I am very pleased! It was a very modern and young atmosphere. Very nice on the inside and patio seating. Nice bar area. Staff was nice and accommodating. Went during Saturday brunch. While there were quite a few people there, there wasn't more than a 5 min wait for seating. The food was AMAZING!!! I had the buttermilk fried chicken with a red velvet waffle and the Mac and Cheese!!! Good portions and great flavors! Very cute for a girls day/night out or a date with your sweetie. Will definitely be back again!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"So their policy is entire party must be present in order to be seated and they only hold tables for 15mins. This is what the hostess advised when she called earlier that day to confirm the reservation. That said, imagine my disappointment when despite arriving exactly on the dot, we weren't seated till 30mins later! Then there was the wait for the menus, then the drinks, then for food orders, then 30+mins for the food.

Chicken & waffles was okay (3/5), but unfortunately the red velvet waffle (which was like a cake) couldn't be subbed with a regular one. My friend got the Mac n cheese which was fine (3/5).... but had a strong flavor which I couldn't identify (either roasted garlic or a bit of truffle). The $6 strawberry lemonade was good (4/5), but small which was disappointing (it's not bottomless). Even the small cup of sprite and apple juice which the kids got, weren't bottomless.

I should add for parties of 5+ a 20% tip is automatically added (if 4+ it's 18%).  It's very disappointing when businesses do this, especially when service is lackluster.

Anyway, I wouldnt return nor would I recommend it.

P.S.- On another note some woman changed her childs diaper on the black bench by the window (okay...). When we looked she was gone and the dirty diaper in a plastic bag left behind. Lady, if you read this..... YOU NASTY!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

There was a female DJ & she was amazing. Really set the tone for the brunch & turned It into a whole vibe. She was playing a lot of early 2000s R&B throwbacks & mellow rap. It was nice!

I ordered the lobster grits, & my date had the steak & eggs & we shared the wings appetizer.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals!  We shared a carafe of the red sangria & this too was good!

A- Appearance of the venue was a 5, they had a cultured yet classy dynamic going on; very interesting composition. Perfect for date night.  

F- Food was an outstanding 5. The Chicken & Waffles is a MUST HAVE ! Aunt Cruz's Mac & Cheese was delish !

Soco,"I dropped my mother off for a surprise 80th birthday celebration on a Saturday afternoon (about 2pm). It was PACKED!!! Do you hear me?! PACKED!!! So, I decided to try something.

I ordered the chicken and red velvet waffles (no thank you). And, I also ordered the appetizer wings with Tzatziki sauce (very good).

* Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles: maybe I need to sit in the restaurant and eat this. By the time I drove home, the waffles were so soggy and heavy...no bueno. Also, they charged me $4.00 extra for all dark meat. Ridiculous. The fried chicken pieces were small (one small leg and two tiny thighs...poor chicks). The chicken was also...umm... dry and seemed like it wanted to have flavor but it was so dry that it just couldn't come out. Result: basura (garbage).

* Wings....YUMMO!!! I'd definitely come back but ONLY for the wings. Believe me, these wings are good.

*    The stars are for the wings, packaging, and the Tzatziki sauce.

FYI - my mother said that she ordered the fish and chips and it was good but she wish that they'd give more fish.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

YAY THAT MEANS I CAN FINALLY TRY JAMBALAYA. It was spectacular. It comes in a small skillet with plentiful food with big fat shrinps on top. Oh my. I was blown away. Mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. Everything was great. During the weekend, it's loud with people getting drunk and roudy. I will be back again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I've been to Soco twice this past year, and I love it! My favorite item on the menu is by far the Mac and cheese! It is so well seasoned and very cheesy. Honestly it's probably one of the best Mac and cheese dish I've ever had. Both times I went during brunch, so I had the Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles as my main meal (with a side of Mac and cheese of course). The meal did not disappoint! The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating both times. Lucas was my server for both times and he is so funny, personable, and attentive. The last time I was there, we had a few things happen, and then manager actually took off 20% of our bill! Good customer service goes a long way!

The only thing that is keeping Soco from being 5 stars is that they got rid of their unlimited brunch option. It is now $25/pitcher. You can get about 4-5 glasses a pitcher which isn't terrible, but the unlimited option for an hour is a better deal.

I will definitely be back!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Our waiter, Daniel, was great and attentive. He answered my questions about the jambalaya to the point. He even took pics, when we asked him.

The food took some time to come out, but we figure it meant to be good and fresh.
I wasn't disappointed because it was delicious and the right amount.

We were even able to redeem the yelp offer of free corn bread that my son had no idea we could get.

Delicious food and drinks were good too.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I would have loved for the brisket to carry more moisture however the plate in it's entirety was pretty well balanced. There is a very savory sauce on the brisket.

I don't want to go into every detail, but there are definitely changes in some of the items like the mac n cheese and waffles. At the end of the day, it all depends on what you want, and what you eat. You might have a great experience every time.

The only pro was the burger was really big and filling. I should stuck to my got instinct and had the wings. Everyone was ordering I'll know for next time if I go.

Soco,"I traveled to New York for the first time during the weekend of my birthday. While there, I wanted to have a birthday dinner with my fiancée. After asking a few friends in the area of a good restaurant, preferably black-owned, one colleague suggested Soco.

I called to make a reservation, but I was told that there weren't any reservations available and it's first come, first served. When we finally arrived, as to be expected, it was pretty full. The only seating they had available was at the bar. Other than that, our wait would've been 30-45 minutes. Hungry, the bar was just fine. It was just two of us anyway.

For appetizer, I ordered Creole Gumbo ($12). GOOD! I usually don't get appetizers, but I was glad I got this one. A little spice to it.

For my entree, I ordered Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($20). Deep down, I wanted the Soul Fried Chicken Sandwich, but I never had a red velvet waffle, and I was intrigued. I enjoyed this meal!

Overall, the experience was nice.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,Always have a good experience here. Excellent service as usual. Today is my bday and I decided to come early for brunch and wasn't disappointed. I was there a few weeks ago for a Graduation party and received the same great service! Will def be back!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"The food here was pretty good. Sometimes its a hit or miss. I honestly loved coming here when they first opened but over time it has just changed. The red velvet waffle was  a hit when it dropped but honestly that red velvet waffle is way to sweet. The bbq chicken and mash is one of my favorite dishes and the last time i had it it was a little bland. The Mac and cheese is good it use to be bomb, but I will still order it . Lastly the Presentation is always pretty which I appreciate but I need consistency in my food. I don't hate it but I definitely don't go as often as I use to. The service staff  however is attentive that has never been a issue",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"This place is AMAZING! First off, the customer service in this place is wonderful. The staff are very attentive, they cater to your every need, they stay with a smile on their faces. I went last night, Saturday night soon as their kitchen opened so about 5:30pm, and the place was packed! We started off with appetizers, I had the gumbo and my mom had the mussels. She loved the mussels but let me say that gumbo WOW just WOW! I need the recipe lol... For dinner she had the Chicken and I had the brisket, full of flavor and so tender! I will definitely be returning! Especially for that gumbo,  I need more!!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Have been done to mitigate my bad experience. I had to wait half an hour for a drink ordered another drink it never came. I had the lobster shrimp and grits the lobster taste like ocean and the rest was to salty. They were just to slow.

Feeling very sad and haven't had an appetite for quite sometime...but since the body needs food, and HB reminded me that I'm a Yelp Elite, reviews must go on.  

We had the wings for apps. It was ok!
I ordered BBQ chicken w/ mash potatoes and string beans with some tea for my entree.

Mash potatoes + veggies were good. Chicken was pretty decent. I only wished they would cut it up. The BBQ isn't like a smokey kind of taste FYI. Anyway, I took some home for leftovers.

Our waiter was pretty attentive and pleasant.

If there was a suggestion box, I'd suggest more items on the menu. It just didn't seem like much to me or perhaps it was just me.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

I'm got a burger and my sisters got the chicken and waffles, and the sausage and grits. Everyone really enjoyed their meal. Honestly I have no real complaints but I have to admit I wish it was a little less expensive. But they show the prices on their website and the food is definitely tasty enough so I'm not mad!

Everything",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Had the creole gumbo and the buttermilk fried chicken with the red velvet waffles.

The good - the creole gumbo was just right. Large succulent pieces of shrimp and a decent amount of smoky andouille makes my mouth water even when thinking back to this meal as I write this review 3 days later.

The (only) okay - the fried chicken itself was a bit dry and smallish (not their fault, I saw the organic note on the menu and honestly should have known) and probably erred too much on the side of trying to be highbrow than trying to make it taste good.

The ""not sure how I should feel about this"" - the red velvet waffle is exactly what you'd imagine it to be. Maybe 80% waffle and 20% red velvet cupcake mix. It was certainly striking to look at. To eat however, left some room for improvement. For one, the red velvet cupcake mix part of the waffle made it crumble more easily which means chunks left in the dipping syrup. Maybe skip the mix in the future and just use red food coloring?",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I came here to celebrate my birthday and was seated immediately. Our waiter was extremely friendly and professional and made sure we was taken care of coming back to our table from time to time to make sure we was okay. We ordered drinks which you can pay $2 to upgrade to top shelf alcohol and came fast, our food shortly after.I had ordered the herb marinated steak which was amazing and my girlfriend ordered cajun creole pasta, which she loved. We shared a aide of Mac n cheese which was AMAZING! You have to have it if you come here.

Soco,"Stopped by Soco recently for lunch.  With so many reviews and the idea of 'famous' mac and cheese I was excited to give this place a try...
unfortunately I left feeling a little 'eh.'  Overall the meal was good, but it wasn't outstanding.

Here's some things you'll want to know before you go:

+/- The Mac and Cheese is good. Whatever cheese combo they use is totally yum.  And if you like a crunchy top - you're really going to love this one. The top is sooo golden and crunchy b/c its broiled for a bit before it hits the table.  However, the noodles at the bottom of the cast iron pan are mushy.  Didn't love the extremes in texture here...

+/- There are no refills on any drinks, unless its water. However, the mango iced tea was delish... so delish I wish I had the opportunity to have several more glasses.

+ Lunchtime sandwich options include either fries or a salad.  

- The fries are no good.   Ugh, should have tried the salad.  The fries are so lackluster.  Thin, average and sprinkled w/ parm cheese.  Why?  It's not even shredded cheese - its parm cheese you'd sprinkle on spaghetti.  Toss those fries in some olive oil with garlic rosemary and parm and you may be on to something...

+/- The fried chicken sandwich is pretty good.  It's different than others I've tried... the biggest difference being that its not one thick cut chicken breast - its several thin chicken cutlets, breaded and fried.  My sandwich had 3 pieces of chicken stacked up on the bun.  I didn't mind this...b/c it made sure that each bite of bun had chicken with it.  But those looking for a traditional fried chicken sandwich may want to try something else.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"OK yall... we came here for brunch and I'm a little shook.

I normally don't like grits at all. I orginally ordered the bbq chicken dish, but after looking at the photos on Yelp and seeing how small the portion was (listen, I was hawnnngry), I ordered shrimp and lobster grits instead. Baybayyyyyyy it changed my life. I don't even want to know how much fat and sodium was in that dish. I was living my best life that afternoon and nothing was going to get in the way! Anyway, I would have licked the bowl if I was at home. This was seriously so good and full of chunks of lobster and shrimp. Everyone in our party enjoyed their food. I loved that we walked right in and could get a seat, the music was amazing, and service was good - not great - but good.

This is definitely a must next time I'm in Brooklyn.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,Mac and cheese taste good and I enjoyed my burger the ambience is nice a bit loud kind of hard to have a conversation but that's just because everyone else around us was super loud.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,I came here last night with some of my friends. Parking was relatively easy to find on one of the side streets. Staff was attentive and not a long wait time for food. Nice portion sizes on everything good music early 90s vibe. Pricing was reasonable as well. I will come again for sure. Also when it comes to reservations they won't seat your party until everyone is present.,4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"My first time at soco i went for my birthday i had a great time. As much as i want to remember what i had to eat i can't. I didn't take any pictures of my food(or the entire time i was there) because i was too in the moment and enjoying myself but because i can't remember I'm assuming that it was good because i usually only remember when my food is bad so i don't go there again.
The second time i went is what made me give soco the side eye. My friends and i decided to go out to eat on a Sunday because we all wanted to celebrate our last outing with a friend who was nearing the end of her pregnancy. We knew that it might be a wait because we came on a Sunday and it's a hot brunch spot but we were fine with it. The hostess told us it would be about 45 mins to an hour so we sat in the car for a bit then we went to the Dunkin' Donuts a few doors down because we were that hungry.(literally had to buy food while waiting to eat) When the hour finally went by we went in and the hostess then tells me she thinks it's going to be another hour because people who had reservations are being seated before us. My thing is if you knew this why didn't you tell me this an hour ago we specifically waited because we thought we could fade an hour wait but any longer would be ridiculous. She honestly had an it's a whatever attitude as if we hadn't waited in the winter for almost an hour and a half and i was ready to leave had it not been for my friend who was 9 months pregnant at the time speaking to the manager we probably would've never eaten. I am giving 3 stars because while the food was good ( although it looks dry) we did end up enjoying ourselves. It really is a nice restaurant and a nice vibe but the waiting game pissed me off. I know restaurants don't want to lose customers but playing with my time is a huge issue for me.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"The last time I have been to Soco before this weekend was 3 years ago and I am impressed and pleased to say the quality of food and customer service has remained high. Minus the hostess that attempted to not seat my party stating ""we're not taking any additional walk-ins for brunch"" after I called 10 minutes prior and received confirmation that we WOULD in fact be seated. Thankfully the manager observed the interaction and immediately corrected the poor child. His attentiveness to his customer and staff interactions is what indeed saved this review from 3 to 5 stars. Food is still amazing, server was fantastic, and we were seated outdoors on a gloriously beautiful day!! It was a great afternoon overall. Thank you Soco for living up to the fond memory I held of you! Well done!!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"In love with everything about this place. A nice soul food brunch spot in Brooklyn, with possibly the best cornbread I have ever had. This place has changed my view on cornbread! It was popular on a Saturday morning but we made it right in time before the rush.

The server was nice and the music was poppin. They had an ambient outside greenhouse style patio that was great to look out to and you can even eat out there. They had a special chicken and red velvet waffle. They also had white cheddar grits. All of the above were just delicious and new to my tastebuds! Must stop here when you're in Brooklyn.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"So I used  to be SUCH a fan of  this place. The food, the ambiance and the music. I frequent this pLace at least 4-5 times. This was my ""spot"". But it has gotten a SOOOOOOO BAD. 1st off I reserved for a party of 15...it ended up being 8 ppl plus 2 kids both undder 3. We got there at 1:15 reservations were for 1:30 we were not seated until  almost 2pm. Fine. We were ushered to the outdoor heated patio which was refreshing from all the loud music & young crowd as this was a family brunch. We were ushered by Mark Daly himself the owner of SoCo whom one my friends asked for a picture & he RUDLY replied "" I do not take pictures while I'm working"". Eww.  I see why Kenya & him aren't together.

Anyway, we sat down and was greeted by a very friendly beautiful waitress named RONIS, she gave us our prefixe menu options which is mandatory for a party of more than 8 ppl which is ridiculous....anyway we ordered. The Mac n cheese was delicious. But that was pretty much the only thing. The Cesar salad had KALE in it!! Who puts kale in a Cesar salad?  The chicken wings were burnt!  3 ppl
(Including myself) ordered the sausage & grits. The grits was soggy & eggs were not seasoned at all. The sausage jusT didn't taste good. 4 ppl ordered the red velvet waffles & chicken  I it was mediocre at best. It did the job it was ""filling"". And 1 person ordered the steak & eggs. Again eggs not seasoned & steak was chewy. . The drinks were nothing to call home about. The included strawberry shortcake was spongy. We all felt very dissatisfied with this overpriced food.

The bill came to $700 plus . I and my party were shocked NOT WORTH THE PRICE. Ronis was very apologetic & they charged us $55 instead of $45 so it was adjusted and decreased.  Fine we paid and left.

The BEST part about our meal & experience was our waitress RONIS!! I shall not be returning. They lost a good customer. I used to recc this place to family & friends from out of town but not anymore more. Due to popularity & the rush of the Brunch crowd they just throw food on the plate & tRy to get you out of the door. Not COOL SOCO. DO NOT GO!!!",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I like this spot. I love a good brunch and this place did not disappoint. The food, the vibe, the ambiance, and the service made this experience worth the drive.

I ordered the chicken and waffles. Though I wasn't crazy about it (red velvet waffle a little sweet but very moist, cake moist) I'll pass and I found the fried chicken to be on the greasy side for my preference. I also had wings which were very good. I'd like to return to try other items on the menu, especially the sweet potatoe pancakes.

The only issue I had was I made a reservation on open table and the restaurant claimed I was a no show when I checked in with the host. Go figure.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"This place is out of this world. I don't really agree with how they price their dishes, but whatever. The food is absolutely amazing here. I tried Lobster, Shrimp & Grits and Buttermilk Fried Chicken. If you check in with yelp, you get a free order of corn bread.

Their corn bread was probably the best I have ever had in my life. Their grits were AMAZINGG. Their buttermilk fried chicken was served with a red velvet waffle so it was the perfect mixture of sweet and salty. Ugh, I wish it was not so expensive. If you did not take a look at the menu, a lot of the classic southern dishes are about $23+.

There is a wonderful ambiance inside with occasion live performance, but the performance does make it too loud to hold a conversation.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Decided to visit Soco after the attention this particular owner received from his reality show wife, and the place did not disappoint! Bonus points right off for the great selections of music-Lots of R&B and Afro-Caribbean music to hype the Friday night crowd.

My company dined on a selection of barbecue chicken and blackened salmon, while I couldn't resist ordering the macaroni and cheese. All orders were more than enough, and I would recommend splitting the BBQ chicken platter. The cornbread was also delicious and complimentary, thanks to their check-in offer!

We were, however, disappointed to find that happy hour service was not available at the table, and when I wanted simple clarification from our waitress, she sent over the manager as a show of unnecessary force to reiterate the policy. They also did not have the Banana wontons available for dessert, which was the one item I did want from the dessert menu. All in all, great experience. Will recommend and revisit!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"This was my second time coming to Soco. I brought my mother to brunch here because I remember the food being very good. I made a reservation for 1:30 on a Saturday and we were able to sit shortly after we arrived with no issues. The waitress was a bit inattentive even though it wasn't super busy but I'll chalk it up to her having an ""off"" day. I wanted to order their chicken and red velvet waffles but after the waitress told me about the $4 up-charge to choose dark meat, I settled on the Eggs Benedict. My mother (we came ordered the sausage and grits. We ordered a Mac and cheese to share. The best part of the meal was definitely the Mac and cheese. It was piping hot when it arrived and it was super cheesy. The portion was large enough for two, but I ate some there and had the rest for dinner.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Authentic and delicious, highly recommend!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"On the entrance my husband and I were welcome with a very friendly gentleman. He advised us to sit by the bar to wait for the rest of our party. We were served a fresh made cornbread with an exquisite smell.  The cornbread had a perfect gritty texture on the outside and softer on the inside. However, I wish the sugar was toned down a little bit. Our waiter, Malcom I believe, have an upbeat attitude with great aptitude on describing the menu and helping us decide. We ordered a Jambalaya. They were able to create a deep flavor in the jambalaya (sautéed Pepper and Garlic). AS the true authentic southern jambalaya, you can see in the picture the sausage, rice and shrimp simmered with tomato sauce. This dish was spot on. I would recommend this place.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Soco,I would've given SoCo 5 stars if not for the wait time. I visited this locale for my birthday. It had been a while so I was excited. The bar staff (while I waited) was amazing. I had a lemon drop for the first time and I wasn't disappointed. The food and drinks pretty much made up for it all. The chicken and red velvet waffle is amazing and you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you don't try the Mac and cheese as it's too delicious.

Soco,"Nice atmosphere!  Music at the right level and fairly attentive staff that are friendly.  The food is good, not OMG but good, good decent food that would make you return.  What wasn't good was the wait...  I waited 47 minutes from the time I was seated till I got my chicken...  I was a party of one and I knew exactly what I wanted before I was seated so why did Bbq chicken for one person take 47 minutes...  Then when I was ready to leave it took forever to get the check.  Just go with some friends with good conversation cause you are gonna wait!

Like I said I ordered the bbq chicken which is served with mashed potato and green beans.  The mashed potatoes were average but the green beans were cooked to
Perfection: just the right level of crunch but still appropriately cooked!  I also ordered theJalapeño cornbread.  It was very yummy as well.

As for drinks I had the red sangria.  Nothing to write home about and I didn't manage to finish it.  Anyone that knows me knows I don't leave cocktails or wine on the table, ever but this just wasn't compelling me to drink.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"My brother has been hounding me to take him to this place, and let's just say that fate brought me here!
Came for a friends birthday brunch, loved that they allow bookings on OpenTable app, made it easy to rsvp. I arrived, finding parking wasn't too bad just had to park down the block. Then we had our whole party ready to go, got seated within 30mins which is understandable for a reservation on the weekend.
They lead us to our table which was in the greenhouse/patio portion. I was thinking it was going to be cold ""but wait, there's more"" THE BENCHES ARE HEATED. Talk about convenience and comfort for this comfort food!!
They don't have unlimited mimosas but they do offer pitchers for like $25/30 that serve 5 each which is a great deal either way.
I ordered the sweet potato pancakes (which I'm not a pancake person but I inhaled them), and the Mac and cheese (came in a skillet and is so untraditional with the flavoring, many hints of garlic and creamy cheese create an amazing combo). Do I regret eating it all? No! By the way, the Mac and cheese is enough for 2 people but I'm greedy so don't mind me.

I'll definitely be bringing my mother here soon because she loves great food. This place is definitely money well spent.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Everyone at our table ordered sangria and enjoyed their food!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Honestly this places is very overhyped due to the RHOA. Very overly priced and the food is very mediocre, says it's a southern place but the food is tasteless and very small portions.
I went there twice the first time it was okay and there was live music which was cool. I ordered steak marinated with potatoes and my boyfriend got waffles and chicken. The wait was long as hell, the food was cold and they used cheap meat to make as steak. My boyfriend said his food was okay.
Today we went back due to giving black business second chances. It was a nice welcoming and we were seated, they stay on top of you to order. The server came and was nice then we ordered our food i got steak and eggs and my boyfriend got chicken and velvet waffles. Our food came out wrong four times. They gave us other people's food and kept saying sorry. So after a 45 minute wait our food came, my food was okay but like i said before it was cheap meat (the shirt steak) very chewy and bland had to ask for salt. My boyfriend hated his food and was so upset he waited so long with hunger and food was very disappointing. Says the waffles we're supposed be red velvet but when you cut through it it was regular waffle color. Badly mixed and very soft, no type of butter, only syrup. I told him earlier we should've been to sweet chick but he wanted to give you guys another chance. Server only came to check on us once took forever to get food off the table and took forever to give us check. No tip for her and never going back to this place. No thank you save your coins !!! Not worth it.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Okay, I've been meaning to come to SoCo for a while now. Never got the chance to come here until last night for Labor day weekend with my sister.

We had dinner here. She arrived before I did and when I made my way inside, the doorman opened the door for me. I really liked that. I believe there is a dress code but I had a tank top and shorts on, so I guess it did not apply to me. I had no issue being let in as other patrons had the same outfit on that I did.

So I made reservations for 10 p.m. We arrived earlier than that (around 9 p.m). We were able to sit down and dine with no issue. There was no waiting for a table at all. I say we were lucky for that being a Friday night. I can only imagine what is to come for Labor Day weekend. This place is also pretty loud but you can still have a conversation with whomever you're with.

So, we sit down and are given the drinks menu. Our waiter comes to us and asks us what we would like to drink and eat. We order and we did have to wait a while for our food. The drinks and appetizers came in a decent amount of time. I was also carded I guess I did not look old enough.

1. Cornbread (5/5). It was delicious and I loved the honey butter that accompanied it. I wouldn't call this cornbread, more like a corn muffin with sugar on top. It is free with a Yelp check in.

2. Creole Gumbo (3.5/5). The flavors in this dish were really good. I'm giving it a 3.5 because there were very little pieces of sausage, lots of okra and green peppers and only two pieces of shrimp. There was not a lot of rice in the dish either. I wish there was more since my sister decided to eat out of it as well. I wouldn't order this dish again. Peaches Hot House has a better Gumbo appetizer.

3. Mardi Gras Cocktail (4/5). It was very good but I wish it was stronger. You can taste the rum but its sparce. The mix of the flavors in this was very, very good as a rum punch. Try it, I do recommend it.

4. Aunt Cruz's macaroni and cheese (5/5). I ordered this as a side dish. It was excellent. My sister took the first bite and said she could taste the roasted garlic. I tried it and I loved it. One of the best mac and cheese dishes out there. I recommend this and the price did increase. It's $12. One is more than enough to eat between two people. If not, you WILL have leftovers.

5. Buttermilk Chicken and Waffles (5/5). I see why this is their signature dish. The waffle is soooo good. One of the best red velvet waffles out there. The chicken on the other hand was really good. It was seasoned to perfection. You can taste the spice. My sister and I ordered this. I could barely finish mine so I took the rest home and was given some complimentary maple syrup.

I wrote all of that to say the food is bomb! This is place is WAY better than Woodland (grossly overhyped). I'm glad we chose last night when it was empty. The crowd is really cool. The waiters and waitresses are working very hard. Trust me, they do their job here. It lives up to the hype. Perfect for date night, girls night out eating dinner, after work drinks, birthday party etc.

I'm definitely gonna stop by here during their brunch hours!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The Chicken was fried to perfection!!! The waffles were good. The flavored butter was ok... sweet chicks butter w/ the waffles were more flavorful. Overall the food Great quality. But the star of this experience was those damn wings w/ the Dipping sauce ... OMFG!!! The purple cocktail i had was amazing also... it was their take on a pina colada. Will definitely be back!!! PS.. it's southern Cuisine. Where's the pork belly and bacon on the menu guys lmfaoooo,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I remember how good Soco was when it first opened. Years later, it's even better! The whole place is a vibe, from the food to the decor and music. The chicken and waffles continue to be a favorite of mine. Their mac and cheese though is EVERYTHING. Service was spectacular and the owner was there making sure everything flowed. This place is consistently wonderful to come to.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I was terribly disappointed with my visit here. The atmosphere seemed to have a great vibe, but what's a great vibe without enjoying great food song with it? Service was ok with the exception of the waitress getting lost a couple times... but to start, the cornbread that is received when checking in with yelp we're just a couple of basic corn muffins (served lukewarm) with maple butter...blah but whatever... onto the food, I ordered a Caesar salad with salmon (that came on the side) and I swear it was a bagged salad mix with salmon on the side (it even had those small croutons they you can find for $.99 at the supermarket). I asked for my salmon well done and it came out rare of course... I just sent it back instead of ordering an alternative.
We ordered their ""to die for"" Mac and cheese, and it was very basic with cavatappi noodles (nothing southern  about it).
My friend had the seafood alfredo, which again was bland. Others with me had the house special wings, they were good as well as the jambalaya. For a party of 4, 2 appetizers, & 2  entree's with drinks included was $110.... I'm not sure how but...whatever.
The owner Mark Daly was there to great guests as they left which was nice. I wish I had told him about my bad experience.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Sigh...it's unfortunate that I'm even writing this review. Review #3. We started at 3 stars, climbed to 4 stars, only to drop to 2.

I use to hit up this spot religiously at least 1x a week sometimes 2x's if I was feeling particularly great. However, I began adulting more and cut back coming so frequently and explored other places.

Sadly the last 2 times I've been here (including tonight) left me disappointed. Here are 4 reasons why...

#1 The menus are falling a part. May not seem like a big deal, but it says you dont see the need in giving customers something nice to look at since they always come anyway. If they a ripped or bent up it's time to replace.

#2 The place itself needs a revamp. New decor or needs to be cleaned more frequently. We sat at the bar tonight and it was super sticky. I remember the bar being clean every time I came in or at least being wiped down as soon as I sat down.

#3 The most important thing that is suffering is the service. The last time I came it took longer than normal to get our food and when we did one person got the wrong order. Not to crazy because crap happens.
However, tonight I was not with it. Myself and a friend sat at the bar and it took over 15 mins for the bartenders to even acknowledge us. I'm use to coming in and getting a hey I'll be right with you and so on. We didn't get any of that. When a bartender finally came we asked could the area we were sitting at be wiped down because it was super sticky. The bartender went on to make 3 drinks and then wiped the area down and didnt even ask if we were ready. I finally asked could we order and the other bartender finally looked at us and took our order. I'm not use to the bartenders here being slow and not particularly friendly. No I dont want you to braid my hair, but it would be nice to feel like you like the spot you're working in and enjoy what you do.

#4 The food was okay but the mac and cheese was off. My friend got the mussels and asked for extra bread and that took 20 mins to come out.

So that was my recent experience with this establishment. It's so unfortunate because I really liked this spot. These last 2x's I've been here have left me underwhelmed. It may be time to give it up.",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"My husband and I went to brunch this past Sunday. They have brunch all day, Yaaaaaaay! He had the jambalaya and I had the Lobster, shrimp, and grits. The jambalaya was very good, but the grits....Amazing!!!( Ms. Oprah voice)  Also my new favorite drink is the Hibiscus agave margarita. Mmmmm. The mixologist took great care of us at the bar.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Soco,"Omg!! It was my first time at Soco BK today which was a perfect way to celebrate Easter!! I really wanted to go to support Kenya & her hubby, yes I'm a RHOA superfan!

Being super last minute, like literally this morning, I called the restaurant to try to get a reservation & unfortunately they were booked but LAMAR (who is amazing in all ways) assured me that although I didn't have a reservation, that if I showed up with my party, we would definitely be seated; which is very rare, as most brunch places would just say ""we're booked"" & hang up. So this made me drive from the Bronx to Brooklyn to not only try the food & drinks but just to experience the SocoBK culture. We arrived as early as possible, checked in with Lamar, who sat us within 30 mins. We had an amazing time! Delicious food, tasty drinks & our waitress was awesome as well.

Thank you so much Lamar!! You really made my day as my party & I truly enjoyed ourselves all thanks to you & your kindness, efficiency & resourcefulness!! I will definitely be back to the restaurant because of you!!

Thank you again :)",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,Great service. Delicious food. The jambalaya soup was perfect for a light meal. It happened to be happy hour and who could pass up on margarita?! I could taste the alcohol. Highly recommended!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I've been here about 6-8 times, it's usually always great, food and service. This past Tuesday I went with my mom, she loved her food, blackened salmon and gumbo.
I got my usual, mac and cheese and herb marinated steak, usually the mac is 10 out of 10, I'm not sure what changed but it wasn't good. It just tasted off. My steak is usually great as well, seasoned perfectly and just great. It was medium like I ordered but it was off as well.

I'm not sure what was wrong with the kitchen tonight but food wasn't that great.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

My friends absolutely loved the Fried chicken with RED velvet waffles and strawberry shortcake French toast, and surprisingly the fish and chips were better here then anywhere I've had them in the last few years. The fish was perfectly fried and didn't taste like an oily mess.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Food is good, especially the chicken and red velvet waffles! The wait is pretty decent for a popular brunch spot,  but the customer service could be better.  We had a leak from the ceiling dropping on us and couldn't get anyone to move us to an available table. Music is good too!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I went to Soco for brunch a few weeks ago and had the skillet with eggs andouille sausage the BFF had the French toast and some cocktails, the food was amazing, we returned two weeks later for happy hour and dinner.
We had multiple rounds of white sangria that was strong and delicious
Dinner:
I had the gumbo, with a side of Mac and cheese and she had the chicken and red velvet waffles, and a side of corn bread that was soft, buttery and yummy.
Dinner service was incredible the staff is amazing my only regret is that I don't live closer. I will definitely be returning to Soco as often as possible.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Soco Brooklyn was awesome! We enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was fresh and came out very quick. The service was top notch everyone was polite and attentive. We sat outside and enjoyed the outdoor patio. I recommend SOCO not just for the name, but for the traditional southern food with a modern twist! I recommend you make a reservation because it was packed.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,Came lastnight with my girls since we came to nyc to visit for the weekend. This place is really dope!!! The corn bread and Mac and cheese was to die for omg!!! It was soo bomb. I had a burger because i knew i would be drinking and to soak up the liquor. But all of my friends had a good time. The atmosphere was also great as well,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"For my birthday earlier last week, my friend and I went to Soco for some much needed soul food. With more than 1,500 reviews and 1,700 photos and still able to maintain a solid 4 star rating on Yelp, I admit, I went in with high expectations! We arrived for dinner at 6pm and they had just finished setting up. Outside, restaurant doesn't seem like much, but once inside, the dining area is quite expansive. Nice looking bar at the front of house and large dining area with spaced out tables, as well as, an outdoor seating area out back. Seats were comfortable and tables were well proportioned.

Having looked through the menu beforehand, we already had a good idea of what we were gonna order! We skipped the apps and started off with some sides: an order of their mac n cheese and cornbread and white cheddar grits. For entrees, I had the whole branzino and my friend had the jambalaya. The apps came out in good time; I think we only waited like 15 minutes or so.

Sides: First off, let me start off with the mac n cheese. I LOVE mac n cheese. Whenever I go to a restaurant that has it, I almost always have to order it! Loll That being said, their mac n cheese delicious! Or as Queens CM Jando puts it quite well ""DANGEROUS."" Nice crispy layer on top and gooey cheese throughout. And the grits and cornbread.. You MUST eat them together! Perfect marriage of flavors! Warm, buttery cornbread and the creaminess of the white cheddar grits! Delish! :D

**Keep in mind though, the white cheddar grits, cornbread and the mac n cheese are rather heavy and very filling. Even for a guy like me, with an appetite like Snorlax, I was already feeling sleepy by the time we finished the apps.**

Entrees came out and my friend and I were already feeling the early onset of food coma. So we literally nibbled at our food and took most of it to go. The few bites I had of my food and of my friend's jambalaya, tasted pretty good. The branzino was definitely well prepared. Flesh was flaky and not dry and the rice stuffing was flavorful. My friend's jambalaya was tasty as well. Loved the andouille chicken and the shrimp!

Overall, we had a delicious meal and great experience dining at Soco. Service was very accommodating! Halfway through our meal, I brought to the attention of one of our waitresses that it was quite hot in the dining area and she said their central a/c was down for repairs. She recommended we be re-seated near the door, as there was a nice breeze coming through the front door, and so we did just that. I will definitely be back to try some other dishes from the menu! :D",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Listen...the waiters and employees are so sweet and interactive, very welcoming vibe. The food was amazing, I got the chicken sandwich and it was delicious. Friend got the French toast and it was the best I've had so far. Went on a Sunday and there was LIVE MUSIC and it was SO good, it really made my day and set the tone. Perfect get together spot for friends and a cute spot for a first date or a date night with your significant other. Real cool and calm vibes but it's also buzzing! Def somewhere I would recommend to a friend visiting like I was.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Soco,"Great for eating in but horrible service for takeout. Although this place is primarily an ""eat in"" restaurant, they do allow for pick up orders. I've now ordered the same salmon Caesar salad twice now, and each time there's been an error. The first time I was given way too  little of dressing (not a big deal) but the second time I was given the smallest amount of salad possible even though I specifically asked for a FULL salad rather than the half. I was also charged for a full serving. I attempted to call only to be placed on hold for 14 minutes and then hanged up on. This place also has horrible phone service. My only issue with this error is that if they offer a half and a full, then how can the quantity I was given be logical? What would the half salad even look like at that point?",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,I came here for my mother in law birthday. The food was ok. I haven't been here since they first opened. The wait in this place is ridiculous even with reservations. Sad! The Mac and cheese definitely taste the same. I was very disappointed in the fried oysters. for $15 or was it $17 it was the smallest pieces I've ever had. I had the fried chicken sandwich it was really good. Over all it was a ok experience.,3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"We came here for brunch on a Sunday, and had made reservations prior to it. It was way too dark for a place at brunch/breakfast time, so already wasn't a fan of that. It is a very popular place, and there is a line forming even before the place opens.

The food itself is pretty okay. I order the bbq chicken sandwich and although it was good, it wasn't worth the price I paid for it.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I definitely give this this Restaurant a thumbs up!!!! The atmosphere is awesome and the staff members were  super friendly and professional at all times. The food was absolutely amazing one point my personal favorite was the Red Velvet Waffles and Butter Milk Fried Chicken. I also had to try their famous side of  the Aunt Cruz Mac & Cheese which was extremely delicious. Ohhhhhh I forgot to mention the drinks were definitely on stage as well, I enjoyed a Bellini for the first time and I would definitely order another one if or when I go back. My advice would be to definitely make reservations before you arrive there, especially if you plan on visiting this place on Friday and Saturday",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,I went here yesterday and the chicken was dry. The waffle was flat. And the mac and cheese was bland. I don't know what type of L train crack y'all are smoking but don't lie to me about soul food no more. Stop it. This was pitiful. The lemonade was good tho and the gumbo hit the spot (once you add hot sauce). But don't play in my face with these yelp reviews no more. I spent $60 just for me to leave still hungry. And during Black History Month too?!! Smh. I am offended.,2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"The food and drinks were great.  The service was outstanding.  I was there on December 12, 2019 about 12:45. It was mid day so the restaurant wasn't crowded.  However, there was some older customers there celebrating a birthday.  I was there with a date and appreciated that we were able to have a conversation without blaring background music.  HOWEVER, the music that was playing was filled with inappropriate language. If I was in the privacy of my own home, then fine.  But this is an establishment with different age groups and races.  If I was there with my parens I would have complained about the music.  Again the food, drink and customer service 5 star but choice of music made me drop my rating to 3 stars.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Soco never disappoints. Food is seasoned well, big portions, and the mac and cheese is perfect.

Soco,"Went to Soco for brunch on Sunday and was very disappointed. They sat the two of us at the skinniest table in the bar that I have ever seen. The walkway between the bar and the tables is so small, only one person barely fits by. Bad design.  The menu descriptions were not accurate. I ordered the hash browns, which were cut round browned potatoes. I even asked the server before ordering if they were true hashbrowns and her answer was YES.  I ordered the chicken and dumplings and the dumplings were filled pasta, not dumplings like one might think. My friend ordered the avocado toast. The server asked her if she wanted the salmon with it which comes with it and she said yes.  When I got the bill, we were  charged $18 extra for a few pieces of thin raw salmon.  Ridiculous.  I will not be going back!",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Soco,"Came here on several occasions mother's birthday being the most recent. This place was beautifully designed and almost had the feel of a lounge at the time although it was only a restaurant, the prices might be a little high but given the neighborhood they can be justified.

The drinks and service were perfect and although a waiter spilled our drinks we were compensated for a round at the table because it got in our food.

Overall very satisfied with our food and service and even the attempt to rectify the situation with drinks spilling in our food.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Boyfriend and I came here for dinner. The restaurant itself has a great vibe - loved the interior and the service staff were both friendly and quick. However the food was pretty underwhelming. The menu itself is pretty small, we ordered devil eggs, the catfish, salmon and split a side of Mac n cheese.

My boyfriend described the catfish as disappointing. The salmon itself was pretty good, but the sides it came with were too garlicky. The Mac n cheese had way too much garlic as well. Neither of us were able to finish our plates, and it's not because of the portion size.

We both ended up having stomach aches for the rest of our night after eating here. :(",2,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Made reservations for 6 for mother day during the week, although we wanted the brunch hours (unaware that Mother's Day would be All Day Bruch), we decided for 5:30. Love the fact that someone called to confirm also. We arrived at 5 and it only took a 10 minutes before we were seated, which wasn't bad. The waiter came shortly after. Shout out to her for having the patience to wait for us to decide on what we wanted lol and being so lovely.

3 Chicken & Waffles, 2 BBQ chickens, Pork Chops and a Mac & cheese and we were SOLD! The food tasted amazing, to the point where we made sure to order to go as well. The only downside was that (and this is probably because it's so good) the Mac & Cheese took a while to come out, but it was amazing!

The Manager/Owner was also present on the floor with the staff making sure everything was going well, especially since they were apparently short staffed. It was our first time checking out SoCo and we will definitely be back",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"First you see Soco on a list for the top 50 Black owned restaurants in the U.S. and you then arrive to dine and find 20-25 people outside waiting to get in. The second thing, you are glad you made a reservation because you probably would not get in otherwise. Last you recommended everyone dine at Soco because the food and service is excellent. All 20-25 of us stood outside until exactly 12:00 when the doors opened, our reservations confirmed and we were quickly seated. As we moved through a modern arts decor a live DJ pumped a vibrant Brooklyn vibe opening with the Queen of Hip Hop Mary J. Blige. Without a thought this Philly girl was singing a common Brooklyn hook and beat in her head...GO BROOKLYN, GO BROOKLYN. That's a good start. Within a minute being seated we were offered water and informed the name of our server. When our server arrived he was pleasant and followed our request of moving quickly as we had to get back to Manhattan for the Broadway stage musical 'Donna Summer'. His response as well as the kitchen was PERFECTION!

I sipped on a delicious Spirit called a 'Brooklyn Bellini', again, GO BROOKLYN GO, BROOKLYN. This is a case where I truly wished I had a bigger appetite and more time. The food around me on other tables took my breath away. My Sweet Potato Pancakes were oddly shaped but really good with the most excellent homemade 'whipped cream ' and berries with an ample side of bacon. I really didn't need syrup. My dining buddy ordered the Strawberry Shortcake French Toast, we traded a little. The French Toast was AH- MAY- ZING!!! Not overly stuffed with junk like other places but the ingredients were perfectly imbedded in the mix. We ordered the chicken wing and shrimp appetizers which I didn't get to. Hopefully my dining buddy (Shirlana D)will write about them.

To sum it up, great service, food, ambiance, decor, value and a recommendation to visit Soco sooner than later!",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

The server was friendly, attentive and made good recommendations. My friend loved the andouille sausage with grits, the corn bread and mac&cheese! My shrimp and lobster with grits was good overall, but I wish the grits were warmer and the lobster was a bit overdone causing it to be rubbery.

Soco,"No air conditioner ??? Why
Came at 9pm place closes at 9:30 we asked the waitress will we still be able to dine .. she said yes the waitress( Gia) was pretty cool .. we ordered drinks and food which came fast,  food was good could use salt on the salmon but I ate every bite so I guess it was delicious.. I'm giving it 3 stars because of no air conditioning when it's 82 degrees outside and for security guard. Now we were waiting for them to return our debit cards when the security guard comes to our table to tell us hey we're closed  we told him we know this we were accepted as patrons to this establishment at 9pm they said we can dine they didn't say eat your food and hurry up  it was a party of 6 so you know to expect at least 1-1 1/2 hour of dining , they shouldn't accept customers if you know it's 30 min to closing
We told the security guard we know your closed we paid the bill we are waiting for the waitress to bring our debit cards he then proceeded to keep saying we're closed we're closed .. I'm confused do we get our debit cards back in the mail cause you now want to kick us out,  bad enough we ate the whole time with no air conditioning sweating and we asked numerous times can they turn it on . All in all I want to give at least 4 stars but I couldn't.

Soco,"Soco is a pretty big space. If you've never been in the area but heard of it before, it's probably because of the fried chicken and red velvet waffle dish they have.

It ain't haute cuisine, but most things on the menu pricier than you'd think for comfort food. Chicken and waffle was $20. The smoked BBQ chicken was the same price, and they had a few entrees that went up to close to $30.

We started out with the Asian style ribs. Would've preferred not Asian style (too sweet), but they were tender and meaty.

We wanted to get the mac and cheese, but it was basically a cast iron skillet of fat and cholesterol. You could probably split it among 4-5 people.

The chicken and waffle was good, though the red velvet was pretty gimmicky. Not sure I would put it on any best-of fried chicken lists, other than the Instagrammable quality of it.

The smoked chicken is the way to go. You get basically a half chicken. Cooked perfectly with a ton of BBQ sauce, mashed potatoes and string beans. Though you could probably also split that with one other person and be full.

I'm fat, is what I'm saying.

Anyway, they have a backyard too, which is cool. Speaking of cool, their air conditioning didn't kick in until about 15 minutes into the meal, so it was a bit uncomfortable. Only other complaint was they let this giant group younger kids wait for a table (or just hang out) by the bathroom area, which caused a ton of congestion. It was weird.

But overall, not a bad experience by any stretch.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Soco,"After hearing the raves about this place, I met up with friends for a catch up brunch.  This place gets packed on Sundays so just keep that in mind. We ended up waiting for about 35 mins for a party of 4 which I'm told is fairly normal.  We were able to snag a great table in the back in a garden area which had a huge skylight so you felt like you were sitting outside.

Service was a bit spotty as things we ordered didn't come or we had to remind the waitstaff numerous times for drinks or sides.  The mac n cheese was sitting out for 10 mins before my main came out. They do automatically add gratuity of 18% to parties of 3 or 4 and 20% to parties greater than 4.

Now the food: we got a feast as the menu was really appetizing. They have a lot of great choices so I had some menu anxiety. I ended up picking the omelette special as it was full of goat cheese, spinach, veggies and spices ($13) which also came with potatoes and toast.  It was a good omelette but the potatoes were the best thing on the plate: delicious with great seasoning, char, and flavor. I also split sides of mac n cheese ($11) and corn bread ($5) that were delicious. The mac n cheese was really good with a well baked crispy top with creamy insides. My friends got the chicken and waffles ($20). Probably the best thing on the menu!",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants

Soco,"So yesterday l decided to try this spot and the three stars given are ONLY for the food. My meal was delicious! However....The service was awful.

Upon entering l walk over to where clearly is the check in by the bar. Don't know where this young ladies head was but she completely ignored me. She was apologetic but still that's no excuse. She told me it would be a 30 minute wait since we missed our reservation. No problem because we found seats at the bar. We thought okay maybe we could just eat at the bar hmmm... NO! Why because the bartender was rude. She didn't smile and seemed very bothered like she didn't want to deal with us.

She only took half the order like l wasn't allowed to order food. So our table opens up we close out the bar tab and even tipped the rude bothered bartender.
Get to the table finally got to order so this is when it's weird. Our waitress never came to the table she kept walking around the table giving nasty looks. The bus boys literally brought our food and the manager took my order.

When we paid the bill that's when the waitress comes over and we told her no. Don't show up for a tip you did nothing. (She had a horrible attitude tall slim brown skin long weave.)

Do better with service  it wasn't a great experience but we made it a good experience for our selves",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Came to SoCo this past weekend and really enjoyed myself. The service was great upon entering the door, the food was awesome and the music was real good. I was impressed and I would go back to this spot again.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"This place is cute. I learned of it through Instagram. I've been salivating for months, wanting to try this place out. My birthday weekend comes and I decide to take the bus from DC to NY to try it out.

First observation: Myrtle Avenue has come a long way since the late 90s/early 2000s. The block is flanked with new restaurants. swanky apartments and other businesses.

Soco definitely stood out. We walk in and it was busy. I didn't see an empty table or seat in sight. This was 8 pm on a Saturday. Thank God I had reservations. I made them through Open Table and I provided a note it was my birthday and that I was from out of town.

My eyes were bigger than my stomach and since I didn't know when I'd be back, I wanted to try everything. We didn't have to wait to be seated. The tall, beautiful hostess walked us straight to the back to our table. It was like an outdoor extension to the restaurant. As we walked back, we walked pass Marc Daly, the owner. He's much shorter and smaller in person than he looks on television.

Here's my experience broken out in pros and cons:

CONS:
The tables were made for children or petite people. The first table we were seated at wobbled badly, so we asked to be reseated. Fortunately, we found a table that did not wobble. It was very small. Maybe 2'X2'

The greens were horrid. I have never had greens so bad. It was like the cook ran out of greens and thought he could throw some on, let them cook an hour and they'd be good to go. Uh, no, boo boo! They were crunchy. No seasoning. No meat. No nothing. Flat out disrespectful.

The drink portions were exceptionally small. My girlfriend ordered a mix drink and it was tiny. I ordered champagne. My portion size was appropriate and it was delivered in a glass flute.

Normally, when you tell a restaurant its your birthday, they'll bring out something - a cupcake, slice of cake, something. Soco did none of that. The hostess, the waiter... no one wished me happy birthday. The ONLY person who said happy birthday as I was leaving to catch my Uber was the man who opens doors for folks. How he knew, I'm not sure, but after being ignored by everyone else, it was a nice and pleasant surprise.

PROS:
Chile, the macaroni and cheese is deadly. I am a mac-n-cheese SNOB. Seriously. Like.... SNOB. The macaroni and cheese at Soco had me salivating. It is, by far, in my top 3 favorite mac-n-cheese from a restaurant. It is not to be slept on. I'm still trying to figure out the cheeses used in it.

The fried chicken and red velvet waffle is also scrumptious. Eating the red velvet waffle was like eating a cupcake. The chicken was small (I ordered white meat), but it was so tasty. Fried to perfection. Seasoned perfectly.

The shrimp and grits - I told you my eyes were bigger than my stomach - were tasty. Now, they were NOT the best I've had. Milk-n-Honey in Maryland has THE best shrimp and grits, but Soco's isn't bad. Not bad, not good, actually, just not the best I've had.

Overall, I was pleased with my dining experience, so I'll definitely be back to Soco next time I'm in NYC.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I came to this establishment on the hottest day of the year and was denied service after being seated because I'm wearing a ""tank top."" The manager saw me walk into the restaurant, ask the hostess for a table, and only after being seated and ordering food was I asked to leave. Never again.",1,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Soco is too cool for school. This place is hip and happening...these folks made a great first impression. I would really recommend making a reservation.

Aunt Cruz Mac and cheese...just wow. Restaurant macaroni and cheese with flavor!? Listen, a lot of these spots don't know that a good mac and cheese needs SEASONING. Noodles and good cheese mean nothing unless the seasonings bring it to form. This mac and cheese was immaculate: seasoned, gooey, cheesy, crusted in the right places. The consistency was pure heaven. Huge portion too, I'm shocked it's a side and not an appetizer.

Buttermilk chicken and waffles...awesome. The chicken was crunchy and seasoned. It was a bit fatty in parts but I didn't mind. The red velvet waffle was soft but still held the syrup and chicken nicely. This combination worked very well.

I took advantage of the free cornbread with an entree from Yelp. Would you believe the cornbread was amazing too? I only got a few bites in because I was stuffed from all the food. The drinks were on point, service was good, and the food was portioned nicely. Anyway, it took me a few years in bookmark limbo to come here, but I will be coming back.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Came here strictly for the mac n cheese and got just that. And an order of gumbo.

The gumbo was average. Not anything to write home about. But the mac n cheese was the thing of DREAMS. It had every element I look for in mac n cheese: creamy cheesy sauce, crusty top layer of broiled and browned cheese, and proper pasta noodle (elbow or cavatappi or gtfo). So simple, but so good. And it's huge. Get it!",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"It's so hard to review SoCo because the food is great, but the service got no better than the last time I went. The seating hostess had major attitude for no reason. My friend wore a beanie and I wore a suede cap, but she only told me that I had to take my hat off. SoCo is definitely not five star dining, so I don't understand why I couldn't wear my hat.

Now let's get to the menu. This is the second time in a row that they didn't have the Carolina Shrimp available. Why have it on the menu if you're not going to serve it? I ended up going with the famous chicken & red velvet waffle which was amazing and especially the bourbon maple syrup. For a drink, I recommend the cucumber cooler.

The waitress was friendly, but she forgot one of the sides that we ordered. Then she charged us for two cocktails that we didn't order and had to wait for a new check.

I enjoyed sitting in their outdoor cabana seating. The area is bright, well lit, and the benches are heated.

Overall, you'll be sure to get a great meal here. But do not expect good quality service at all, especially for the prices.",3,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,Love the atmosphere and the food is to die for!!!! The staff members are so polite!!,5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"This is easily the best soul food out there (period). The service is fantastic, they have a welcoming and warm atmosphere full of life on any morning. The entire staff waits hand and foot on everyone who walks in the door. The Mac and cheese will traumatize you, it's that good. The chicken and waffles were so good that it's borderline inappropriate. And don't get me started on the wings. It put an end to all wings. SoCo is the end all be all. If I could rent the bathroom and live there I would.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"I'm so amazed about the service here Elliott and Nelson was the best Nelson was very attentive my table was never dirty .. very good hostess, my food was sooo good I had the bbq chicken my friend had the shrimp lobster and grits I also.

Soco,"The food was outstanding. As a real southern girl, I definitely recommend giving Soco a try!
We ate the shrimp and grits, dragonfly shrimp, gumbo, corn bread muffins, chicken sausage, and potatoes.",5,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
Soco,"Had a lovely ladies brunch here. We couldn't make a reservation, but the restaurant was very accommodating with our group of 7. We were put up in a nice round table with a very attentive waiter.

I ordered the Farmers Omelette, and the veggies were fresh and crisp. Almost all of my friends ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with the red velvet waffle. Wow, did I have food envy. Upon sneaking a few bites from each person, I can attest that it was GOOD.

Will be back.",4,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?osq=restaurants
