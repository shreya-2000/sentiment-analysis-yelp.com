One of the most important aspects of the travel industry is its hotels. There is nothing more important for the upcoming hotel businesses than the customer satisfaction. Yelp.com being a versatile-platform for local upcoming businesses  to come together so that more and more people from across the world would get to know them. It is an e-service where you  can know everything about a hotel, be it happy or sad customers, hotel ratings and what not wherever and whenever you want. This not only helps the businesses to enhance their marketing schemes, facilities and services but also gives the customers lots of options to choose from. First we scrap the hotel reviews from www.yelp.com then we propose not just one but many frameworks to compare and analyse the customer reviews on real-time data. Logistic regression, SVM, Naive Bayes and LSTM are the algorithms that we have used. At last we measured the performance of the classifiers based on their precision, accuracy, recall and f1 score.
